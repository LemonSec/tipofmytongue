fall past no past

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,920
even if you've taken it this semester

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,519
you can take it again because we're

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
going to have different speakers

so today to close out we're we're going

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
to a different continent uh our our

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,399
speaker is professor

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,440
uh steve fernell and uh steve

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,640
is a professor of cyber security at the

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
university of nottingham

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
in the united kingdom he also has

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
um appointments courtesy or adjunct

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,520
appointments

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
in australia and south africa so he

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,600
actually uh in a sense is spanning four

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
continents

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
as he speaks to us today uh steve has

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:09,920
been

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
working in the area of cyber security in

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
a number of different aspects

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
including usability management intrusion

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
detection

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,880
and many of the areas actually similar

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,280
to

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
what i've been working in during my

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
career so we've encountered each other a

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,479
few times

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
and also of note

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,759
an organization that's not as well known

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,960
in the u.s is

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
ifip the international federation of

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
information processing societies

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
this is a multinational organization

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,759
that national computing organizations

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,119
can be members of

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,960
and individual researchers can join the

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,799
technical committees

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,560
technical committee 11 is the one on

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
basically cyber security privacy and

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
related topics

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
and steve happens to be the current

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,799
chair of ifiptc

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
11. so uh

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
i think i've probably covered most of

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,119
the high spots although not quite all

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
and at this point i'm going to turn it

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
over to

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
steve so he can tell us about whether we

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
can recognize cyber security skills

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
so steve thank you for being here thanks

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
for watching dudes for the opportunity

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
delighted to be here

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
and hopefully the internet connectivity

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
will hold up uh long enough for me to

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
actually deliver the talk i'm getting a

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,840
few

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
jitters on my side i think it's my

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,519
internet but let's see how we go so

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,080
let's

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
start off by hopefully sharing the

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
screen

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
so hopefully now you can see some slides

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
there so yeah

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
the topic of the talk uh staff has

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,319
kindly mentioned

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,599
all about cyber security skills and

79
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
basically yeah we know we need them but

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
do we know what we're looking for do we

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
know what they look like

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,959
when we're trying to find them that's

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
the basic premise of this talk

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
okay so a bit of a outline for you to

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,519
give

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,040
some sense of structure we'll see how it

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
goes as we we get through it but

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
um to begin by setting the scene talking

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
about something you may have heard of

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:19,840
already this cyber security

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,040
we appear to have had a glitch there in

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
the networking

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,420
so please stand by and

94
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,599
[Music]

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
i'm sure we'll get steve back as soon as

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:47,839
we can

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
oh we lost him i'm

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,680
sure he'll dial back in here or connect

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,840
back in

100
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
that's the one thing that doesn't happen

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,239
with in-person talks we don't get

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,680
people to freeze up in the middle of

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
what they're saying

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
oh he's coming back all right welcome

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
back steve

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
hello can you still hear me now yes

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
you put up the first slide started in

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
and then we lost you oh wonderful

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,520
okay dropped out for me um so let's

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
let's go back to the the content slide

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,639
then

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
um let's start again from here

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
right i've tried a different bit of

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
internet connectivity now so let's see

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
how this holds up so

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,919
aim of the session talking about the

117
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
cyber security skills gap

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
and the fact that there is a notable

119
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,479
demand for cyber security skills in the

120
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,199
market

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,800
but then moving on to think about what

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
does this mean in terms of

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
actually how we define and recognize

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
cyber security because

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
in actual fact there are a number of

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
frameworks out there that define it

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,320
cut the cake in rather different ways

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
and that then goes on to inform

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
how we recognize qualifications and

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,680
certifications

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,639
in the area that then in its turn leads

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,240
through to okay there's all these things

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
out there that an individual

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,720
could be pursuing could hold um as

135
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
things on their their resume

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
but what do we actually see being more

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
in demand perhaps than some other things

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
we'll look at that and then we'll draw

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,440
things

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
to a close and hopefully internet

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
connectivity will hold up through the

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
rest of it

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
so just a little bit more

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
scene setting about me staffers had

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
quite a bit of this already so just to

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
give a little bit of context

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
yes i'm a professor of cyber security at

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,039
the university of nottingham

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,800
written quite a number of papers in the

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
topic air over the years

151
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
some of them people have even read um

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
i'm the editor of something called

153
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,759
information and computer security which

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,680
is one of the the journals particularly

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
addressing

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
the business organizational and human

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,680
aspects

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
of security i'm a board member something

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
called the chartered institute of

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,039
information securities that's a

161
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,560
professional body

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
particularly interested in

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,319
professionalism and skills in the cyber

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
security arena

165
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
and so it's sort of relevant to the

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
context of this talk and as was

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
mentioned i'm the chair of ifip

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,840
technical committee 11.

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
um and something that's relevant to

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
something i'm going to draw upon

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,319
at certain points in this presentation i

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
was contributing to a cyber security

173
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,039
skills

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
study that was done well last year and

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
this year in the uk

176
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
from our department for digital culture

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
media and sport so one of the government

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,360
departments

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
that's interested in this space a number

180
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
of research interests

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
and the one that's the most relevant in

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
the context of this it overlaps with

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,319
this issue

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,880
of security culture and awareness within

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
our organizations and having

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
cyber security skills to support that is

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,520
sort of rather fundamental

188
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
okay so to set the scene properly on the

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
topic i'm sure you're aware that over

190
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
recent years cyber security as a topic

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
has become quite prominent quite visible

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,120
within

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
the organization space it's not that it

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
was invisible in prior years but it's

195
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
even more

196
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
acutely visible now and seen as a

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,759
priority

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,360
but as i say on the second bullet

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
everybody seems to say they want it but

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
do they really know

201
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
what they want how to characterize it

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,400
what do they recognize cyber security as

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,520
including

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
and also if they then need skills to

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,319
support this provision

206
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
what do the qualifications and the

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,000
certifications that are out there

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
actually cover across the breadth of

209
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
what cyber security could and maybe

210
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
should include

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
and actually the topic can end up

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
looking rather different depending on

213
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
what perspective you're viewing it from

214
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
and what we use

215
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,560
as our reference point as our guide to

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,479
the topic so we'll we'll look at that

217
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,319
and we'll give some examples

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,560
to particularly illustrate the point and

219
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
then show how that in its turn maps

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
through to the presentation of

221
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
qualifications

222
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,800
okay so there are various qualifications

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
various professional certifications

224
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
that are available that our current

225
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
workforce might have

226
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
and that our future workforce those

227
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
looking to be employed in cyber security

228
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
could be pursuing are they all the same

229
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,360
well

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
i'll spoil the surprise there no they're

231
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
not they're many and varied

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
and so given that how can we tell the

233
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,720
difference between these different

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,199
things

235
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
that are on offer all right so

236
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,840
first of all i mentioned that there's a

237
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,679
skills gap and so let's

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
start to evidence this a little bit so a

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
few slides with some information on this

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,719
first from

241
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
enterprise strategy group going back to

242
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,719
some data that they

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,200
were last presented in this form back in

244
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
2019

245
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,519
so they over the years have looked at

246
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
what organizations are facing in terms

247
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,160
of skill

248
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
shortages within their environments and

249
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
the top most skill over the

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
last few years that they did this survey

251
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
the one

252
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
named most problematic was cyber

253
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
security skills not only was it the top

254
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
rated

255
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
area of challenge it was also a growing

256
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
error as you can see from the charts an

257
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
increasing

258
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,519
proportion of the respondents indicating

259
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,480
that they've got

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,560
a problematic shortage in that space

261
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
if we want something a little bit more

262
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
widespread as a population we've got isc

263
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,160
squared's

264
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,399
global sample for a cyber security

265
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
workforce study

266
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,760
again this study has been done over

267
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
successive years i'm drawing on the most

268
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,560
recent

269
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
version of the report here so almost

270
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
two-thirds of organizations reporting

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,760
some form

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,839
of skill shortage in relation to cyber

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,120
security

274
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
42 characterizing it as a slight

275
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,160
shortage

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
and almost a quarter saying it's a

277
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
significant shortage for them

278
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
and as a result over half indicating

279
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
that their organization was a

280
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,519
moderate or extreme risk as a result of

281
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,720
not having the skills

282
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,760
that it needed and to put a

283
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
number to this shortage the most recent

284
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
suggested it's about 3.12 million

285
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
globally

286
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,360
shortage of cyber security practitioners

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
which is at least a drop from what they

288
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
estimated

289
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
the year before but whichever way you

290
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
look at it it's a big gap to fill

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
so that sort of raises the question

292
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
if we are looking for people if we've

293
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
got a skills gap and a lack of

294
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
practitioners in our organizations

295
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,560
what sort of things are we actually

296
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
looking for so here are just some

297
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
examples of job ads that i i drew upon

298
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,399
in the uk

299
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,839
and the thing that i'm trying to show

300
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
here is the myriad different

301
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
acronyms and post nominal uh

302
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
abbreviations there that you would see

303
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
for some of the certifications that are

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
on offer so

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,040
just looking at the first one um so

306
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,120
system ch just to name the first three

307
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
um certifications there so we've got the

308
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
certified information

309
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
um security uh practitioner we've got

310
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
certified information

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
security manager we've got certified

312
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
ethical hacker

313
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
and those three certifications in

314
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
themselves

315
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
are not the same thing so for that

316
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
particular role cyber security engineer

317
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,920
for those three certifications to be

318
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
listed as being

319
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,399
suitable well they're not all denoting

320
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
the same skill set they're not denoting

321
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,519
the same level of experience and so if

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
somebody was to hire somebody with a ch

323
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
versus somebody with a cis versus

324
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
somebody with a system

325
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
well they might not be getting the same

326
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
thing for their money so to speak and it

327
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
and it goes on as you as you look

328
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,600
through

329
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
that list of different roles you can see

330
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,720
there's some quite

331
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
interesting salaries available for those

332
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
that have got the numbers

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
associated with them um and we'll come

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
back to this point later on once we've

335
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,040
had

336
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
a little bit more of a look at some of

337
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
the detail

338
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
so who are we looking for so certainly

339
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,079
yeah okay organizations need somebody

340
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
to handle their cyber security needs if

341
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,600
you if you have a

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
cyber security requirement which most

343
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
organizations will have

344
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,959
you need some sort of practitioner to

345
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,399
deal with it and i've got this picture

346
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,519
of a unicorn

347
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
on the side which we'll return to later

348
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,639
um

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
perhaps as part of the discussion but

350
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
the the key

351
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
thing here is trying to point out that

352
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,040
some of the

353
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
the requirements that people are looking

354
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,639
for are perhaps

355
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
unrealistic to find within a single

356
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
person so you're looking for this

357
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
mythical

358
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
practitioner that might not actually

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
exist in reality and it's where

360
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
some of those previous job adverts were

361
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,360
perhaps pointing

362
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
now those that we're looking to hire to

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
provide the support they need to

364
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
understand

365
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,079
the relevant parts of topics so they

366
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
need to have cyber security knowledge

367
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
but they also need to have practical

368
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
skills to put into practice what's

369
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,600
needed

370
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,200
to handle the protection so as potential

371
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
employers in the area

372
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
how do we know what's relevant as

373
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
potential employees how do we know

374
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
what's relevant

375
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
to pursue to advance ourselves

376
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
appropriately

377
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
how do we recognize the skills and also

378
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
where do we find as employers in

379
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,600
particular

380
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
the people that have got the skills

381
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
we've now decided

382
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
we want so all of these are challenging

383
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,160
questions and

384
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
we'll begin to unpack some of them as we

385
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
go through

386
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
but i suppose it brings up the question

387
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
of well what is cyber security

388
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,600
anyway um and so yeah

389
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,839
it's very easy to say cyber security is

390
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
all about protecting systems data etc

391
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,639
etc

392
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
but what does that include if you break

393
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
it down into some of the underlying

394
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,959
subtopics and i've

395
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
i've said here it's a multi-faith

396
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
community of practitioners what i'm

397
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,760
trying to

398
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
draw out here is what the subsequent

399
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
point the highlighting

400
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
that there's a range of topics some of

401
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,440
them are technical and they're perhaps

402
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
the things that we tend to recognize

403
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
more immediately

404
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
than in the way that it gets presented

405
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,160
to us and i'll evidence that as we go

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,399
but there's also non-technical topics

407
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
but the human aspects legal aspects

408
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
the physical protection of physical

409
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,360
environment and needs consideration

410
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
another perhaps often a skew towards the

411
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
technical aspect

412
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
so

413
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,959
looking at uh some data from a this

414
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,240
survey from

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,120
the uk uh department for digital culture

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
media and sport dcms

417
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
conducted by a company called ipsos mori

418
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,560
and published earlier this year

419
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
it's drawing upon respondents from uk

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
organizations

421
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,399
looking at the skills in this particular

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,680
case that they

423
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
claim to lack confidence in so if we

424
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
we look at how the survey grouped it

425
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
here into a set of technically oriented

426
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,480
tasks

427
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
governance tasks and communication

428
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
related tasks

429
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
in cyber security it's interesting to

430
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
see the proportion of respondents saying

431
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
they lack

432
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
confidence in their organization's

433
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,160
ability

434
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
to handle different categories of things

435
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,639
so if we look at the technical tasks

436
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:58,959
that

437
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,720
the thing that they're least confident

438
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
in so the largest proportion

439
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
saying not competent is penetration

440
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
testing okay so

441
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
a quarter of organizations doubting

442
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
their abilities to handle that

443
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,279
particular

444
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
task but if we look at the governance

445
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
tasks the things the overarching things

446
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
that ought to be

447
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
protecting the organization as a

448
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,639
business as an organization

449
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
well carrying out a cyber security risk

450
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,760
assessment

451
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
almost half of the organizations lack

452
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
or lack confidence in their ability to

453
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
facilitate that and you'd imagine

454
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
actually that ought to be one of the

455
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,440
more fundamental things

456
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
for an organization to be able to do

457
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
before it starts thinking about

458
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
its technical controls and the skills

459
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,959
there

460
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,560
because it ought to have an

461
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
understanding of where it's at risk

462
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,720
where

463
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
what are the threats where the

464
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
vulnerabilities and similarly if we look

465
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,040
at

466
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
communication related tasks okay the

467
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,240
vast majority do feel confident in

468
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
the ability to give password guidance so

469
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,240
only seven percent

470
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,800
not confident there but in terms of

471
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,040
preparing training materials or

472
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
training sessions for the staff within

473
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,480
the organization

474
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
those people that you want to be

475
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,839
securely aware

476
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
and behave in a compliant manner

477
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
well there's a lack of significant lack

478
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
of confidence

479
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,399
there so if we look at these sort of an

480
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,440
aggregation

481
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
and compare them together the biggest

482
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
area of lack of confidence is around

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,839
governance then communication then

484
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,759
the technical aspect so there's a lack

485
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
of confidence to some degree in all of

486
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,320
them

487
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
but it's more pronounced in the

488
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,759
non-technical areas

489
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
as it turns out and perhaps that relates

490
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,079
to how some of this

491
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
is is presented in terms of the the way

492
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,000
security as a topic is presented in

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,959
education

494
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,199
and in industry certifications as we'll

495
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
come to see

496
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,959
so looking at where the demand actually

497
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
is and the skills that the profession

498
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,440
says that the practitioners ought to

499
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
have here

500
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
again from the uk the infosec institute

501
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
back in 2018

502
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,359
listed ten areas of uh top as they call

503
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,679
them

504
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,559
top ten skills security professionals

505
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,520
need to have

506
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
and if we look at the top five okay

507
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,559
they're fairly

508
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,119
well framed around technical aspects of

509
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,000
security most

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,559
generally there but looking further down

511
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,000
the list we get into things that

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,240
actually aren't security specific

513
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
at all so customer service communication

514
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
the ability to collaborate all of these

515
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,280
are much more

516
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
team personal interpersonal soft skills

517
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
in some of the cases so it's not just a

518
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,120
case that

519
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,760
we need security specific skills we need

520
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,320
those

521
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,799
business skills in order to actually

522
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,360
take

523
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,000
the security aspects and enact them in

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
an organizational environment

525
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,240
and again ramming this point home a

526
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
little bit further another study from

527
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,640
isc

528
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,679
square back in 2018 talking about hiring

529
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,880
and retaining

530
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,360
cyber security talent the the things

531
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
that their respondents

532
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,080
said were the most important skills or

533
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
the most commonly used skills

534
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
by their respondents were around

535
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
strategy around management user

536
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,600
education

537
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
and risk assessment and then security

538
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
operations i guess is the only one of

539
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
those that

540
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
perhaps brings out is more technically

541
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,120
oriented

542
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,280
now as the footnote there at the bottom

543
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,919
says this particular sample was likely

544
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,799
skewed by

545
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,440
who they were asking because they were

546
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,320
senior

547
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,559
level respondents so two thirds of them

548
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,559
in middle management or higher

549
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,080
roles so okay perhaps they've moved past

550
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
technical skills being part of their

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
day-to-day

552
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
diet of activities so perhaps the

553
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
technical skills are

554
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,360
more prominent more dominant at the the

555
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
lower level roles within cyber security

556
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
and then as you advance

557
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
you're progressing more into the need

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
for these these softer

559
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,320
non-technical aspects

560
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
so am i trying to promote a message here

561
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
that non-technical skills are actually

562
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,039
the most

563
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
important or more important than

564
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,559
technical no no i'm not

565
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,679
um the key point is that all of it

566
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,039
is part of the picture that an

567
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,919
organization needs to recognize

568
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
and somehow it needs to to facilitate

569
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
these we require this holistic view

570
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
of cyber security as a topic and

571
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,919
actually

572
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,919
the way it can be presented is quite

573
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,960
different depending on where you look

574
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
and so as a practitioner what you may be

575
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,160
perceiving cyber security to be

576
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
what you understand it to be about might

577
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
be quite influenced by

578
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,720
how you've learned about it what you use

579
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
as your main frame of reference

580
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
particularly if you were focused around

581
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
one particular source of reference as

582
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
your guide

583
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
to the understanding of it so what i

584
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,480
want to do now is look at some different

585
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
security frameworks and evidence this

586
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
point that they actually cut the domain

587
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
up quite differently

588
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,919
so as one example this is something that

589
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,360
you may have come across certainly in

590
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,679
the uk this is getting promoted

591
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
quite significantly because it's

592
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,360
something that was sponsored

593
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,919
um in terms of work by our national

594
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
cyber security center

595
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
here in the uk it's the creation of

596
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
something they call the cyber security

597
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,159
body of knowledge or cyboc for short and

598
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
this was first published in full in um

599
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,640
october i think it was of 2019 and at

600
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
the time

601
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,720
was breaking the topic error up into 19

602
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
knowledge areas as listed here on the

603
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
slide so this is

604
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,600
a bit of a moving um target or a moving

605
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
face in the sense that there are more

606
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,520
knowledge areas being released and some

607
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,679
of these existing ones are being revised

608
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,520
but what we can see here is how the

609
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,200
initial release of cyborg

610
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
cut up the topic area so we've got a

611
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
a range of things the first one their

612
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
risk management and governance

613
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
feels quite non-technical quite business

614
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,760
focused

615
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
but the the one at the bottom of that

616
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
particular column malware and the one at

617
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
the bottom of the

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,159
the next column forensics field more

619
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,120
technically

620
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
oriented so we'll we'll look at this a

621
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
little bit further as we go

622
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
but just as a contrast looking at

623
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,320
something else

624
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
that's been around for actually quite

625
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
some time the most recent release i

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
think still is 2013 but it

627
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
you can track this particular standard

628
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
all the way back to the mid 90s

629
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
is the iso international code of

630
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,240
practice

631
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
for um security controls as they now

632
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,440
call it

633
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
had a few name changes was code of

634
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
practice for security management

635
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,000
up to this particular release but this

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,480
one

637
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
cuts the topic air into 14 different

638
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
topics

639
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,720
and again looking at this list we begin

640
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
to see things that are actually

641
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
more business and organizationally

642
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
focused than

643
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
perhaps the way that cyborg was

644
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,480
presenting things

645
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
um underneath all of this there's 114

646
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
different specific controls but

647
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,360
these 14 areas these 14 clauses

648
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
is how they at the top level cut

649
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
security up

650
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
and group the controls together

651
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
so if we try and put this into some sort

652
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
of color-coded chart and also compare it

653
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
with a few other potential reference

654
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,360
points so firstly let's go across the

655
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
top and explain what these things are

656
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
so we've got the irc squared common body

657
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,640
of knowledge

658
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
this is the knowledge base of the

659
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,000
underpin cis and other

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
professional certifications from isc

661
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
squared so they're one of the

662
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,919
leading certification providers we've

663
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,919
got the skills framework from cissec the

664
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,480
chartered

665
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
institute of information security and

666
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
that i'm a board member of in the uk

667
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,960
which is a common frame of reference

668
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
certainly amongst corporate um

669
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
organizations in the uk we've got the

670
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
cstec

671
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,760
2017 curricular guidance um which was

672
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
produced by

673
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
a combination of the acm ais um ieee and

674
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,200
ifip

675
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
uh back in 2017. we've got cyboc that

676
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
i've mentioned we've got iso 27002 which

677
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,679
i've mentioned

678
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,000
the nice workforce framework and the

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,880
nsa's

680
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
um cyber um or centers of academic

681
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
excellence in cyber security

682
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,640
and all of these have got some way of

683
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
cutting up the topic area

684
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
grouping cyber security or information

685
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,679
security

686
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
into top level groupings and we've seen

687
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
the way in particular that cyborg and 27

688
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,360
0002

689
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
did it and all of the others have some

690
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
sort of categorization

691
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,919
now i've not shown the the specific

692
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
topics of the others but what i have

693
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,159
done

694
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,720
is attempted to color code whether the

695
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,159
the topics that they present

696
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
are predominantly on or fully

697
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
non-technical

698
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
a mix of technical and non-technical

699
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,919
topics that such that you wouldn't say

700
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,480
there

701
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
specifically one or the other fully or

702
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,400
predominantly technical

703
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
or even not specifically cyber security

704
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,360
related so there's only one

705
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
bit within that that's color coded there

706
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,640
in red

707
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
that's from the sysec skills framework

708
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,919
where there's a skills group

709
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,760
about management leadership and

710
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,039
communication

711
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,360
aspect which is more about fitting into

712
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,240
the business

713
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
part of things but in the case of the

714
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
others you can see

715
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
using my highly scientific color coding

716
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,320
here that it's quite a mixed picture

717
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
so looking at the two that we'd already

718
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
seen the list of topics for cybork and

719
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
iso 27002 you can see that the balance

720
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,799
in those two cases is indeed quite

721
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,159
different so cyborg

722
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,240
the topics that it headlines are

723
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,279
predominantly

724
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,679
technical and in 27 0002 they're

725
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,480
predominantly

726
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,440
non-technical so let's just look under

727
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,559
the surface again and see

728
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,640
how i did the color coding for those

729
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,679
particular

730
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
pair of them so that's again using the

731
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,799
same

732
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,760
color coded scheme that's how i grouped

733
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,799
the topics

734
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,679
so the first few cyborg things are

735
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,760
non-technical topics in the way that

736
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,400
cyborg

737
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,720
when you look at the document is

738
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,919
presenting them

739
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,840
but the majority of technical and twenty

740
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
seven thousand two it is almost the

741
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,159
reverse

742
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
situation and they're not the same list

743
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,279
of topics

744
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
in the first place either you've got 19

745
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
versus 14

746
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,760
apart from anything else to make it

747
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
quite clear that there's a difference in

748
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,640
the way

749
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
things have been grouped so again these

750
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,880
two things

751
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,840
are and all of the others are potential

752
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,960
reference points

753
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
that people could be using so just going

754
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
back to the slide they're so sea set

755
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,480
the c6 2017 curricular guidance

756
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
that specifically exists to guide

757
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
universities in

758
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
providing undergraduate curricula in

759
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
cyber security so

760
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,120
it is skewed somewhat towards the

761
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
technical coverage we could see from

762
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,559
that

763
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,520
so moving ourselves along so what do the

764
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,799
frameworks offer they're a point of

765
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,080
reference for us to map

766
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,799
other things again so we can map courses

767
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,720
we can map professional certifications

768
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,120
and

769
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
training and in some cases that's

770
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,559
specifically what

771
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
they've been provided to do so i say the

772
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
csec 2017 guidance it's specifically

773
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,000
created

774
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,120
to be our guide to creating academic

775
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
programs or degrees from the graduate

776
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,559
courses

777
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,799
the ift squared common body of knowledge

778
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,640
well that's specifically there

779
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
as a reference for ic squared's own set

780
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,559
of certifications so cis

781
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,679
sscp and various others the other

782
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,600
frameworks things like cyboc

783
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
um they've got a more general purpose

784
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
but you can still use them

785
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,360
in this context so a dark uh paper

786
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,960
by halle that'll call mirror is

787
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
specifically comparing other security

788
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
frameworks against cyborg

789
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,679
to show the varying degrees of mapping

790
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,240
so again

791
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
it's not any of them have got the right

792
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,279
answer

793
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,679
but what they've got is different views

794
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,640
on the topic

795
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,960
and so if you're guided by one of them

796
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,840
in particular

797
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
you're going to get a different

798
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,440
potential outcome um to what you would

799
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,559
get with one of the others

800
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,480
okay so i've said some of that anyways

801
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,760
it's not that any of them are right or

802
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,159
wrong

803
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
but you need to be clear on what your

804
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,039
purpose is in using them

805
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,520
so going back to and we'll return to

806
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,880
some of this in a second but going back

807
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,159
to the needs of

808
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,720
employers and what they're expecting or

809
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,000
this issue of technical

810
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
versus non-technical so a quote an

811
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,760
interesting quote from

812
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,640
isaka's um state of cyber security

813
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
survey looks going back

814
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,679
into 2019 currently the most prized hire

815
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,840
in a team is a technically proficient

816
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
individual who also understands

817
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,480
business operations and the needs of the

818
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,279
enterprise how

819
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,840
cyber security fits into that and

820
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
similarly symantec from a

821
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
another study in the same year the

822
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
really good people are far more than

823
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
just technically skilled

824
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,320
especially in the higher ranks you'll

825
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,799
have that mix of technical and soft

826
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,919
skills

827
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,360
and the key point there which enables

828
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,440
them to implement frameworks that really

829
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
work because they understand

830
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
what they're trying to implement and

831
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,840
what they're trying to fit it into

832
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,640
so all right all very well things are

833
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,840
different

834
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,480
how does that relate to for example how

835
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
we teach cyber security

836
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
in universities so what i've got on the

837
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,679
next couple of slides is

838
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
some examples from the uk and also from

839
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,760
the us

840
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
in each case 10 msc programs

841
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
depicting them in the same way that i

842
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,240
depicted the frameworks

843
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,960
and color coding them in the same way

844
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,799
the interesting i think is interesting

845
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,120
thing here is that all of them are

846
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
marketed with the same

847
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
title they're all called msc cyber

848
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,919
security

849
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,200
so it's not ms msc cyber security and

850
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
penetration testing and digital

851
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
forensics or anything like that they're

852
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,399
all called exactly the same thing

853
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,640
and what we did here and this is um

854
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
drawn upon in a couple of papers at our

855
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,480
highlight towards the end

856
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
we looked at what the the publicly

857
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,919
available syllabi

858
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,159
for these programs was saying and looked

859
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,760
at the topics that were therefore

860
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,480
represented

861
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,600
under the surface of this heading

862
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
now i've not got the detail presented on

863
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
the next couple of slides but what i do

864
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,919
have is

865
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
the color coded result and it shows you

866
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,159
quite a difference in the balance

867
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,679
so here's 10 uk cyber security

868
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,760
programs and i suppose the one that

869
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
always jumps out to me

870
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
is program number five here which is a

871
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
program that has

872
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,120
50 percent of its coverage is about

873
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
cyber security so you've got modules

874
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
with cyber security in the title um or

875
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,120
cyber security issues and

876
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,919
digital forensics malware analysis

877
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,760
secure development things like that

878
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,799
the other 50 is not cyber security

879
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,799
specific so it might be a general module

880
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,200
on

881
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,120
software engineering or networking or

882
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
databases or something like this

883
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
so okay there could well be relevance

884
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
to cyber security within that there

885
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,679
could even be some

886
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
cyber security coverage embedded within

887
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,799
it but the

888
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
the module the unit concerned is not

889
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,480
about

890
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,440
cyber security nonetheless the program

891
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,640
is selling itself

892
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,679
as a cyber security specific program

893
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,520
and i suppose it's in stark contrast to

894
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
some of the others program

895
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
four for example there you've got a very

896
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,799
technically oriented casting of nscd

897
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,760
cyber security

898
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,679
program 10 you've got actually the

899
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,039
balance skewed towards

900
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,559
non-technical coverage so key thing is

901
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,200
again

902
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,399
it's not that any of them has

903
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
particularly got it right or got it

904
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,120
wrong

905
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,919
but they're all selling by name the same

906
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,559
thing

907
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
but what they're selling is quite a

908
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
different thing so as a potential

909
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,279
applicant to one of those programs or an

910
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,480
employer

911
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
of a graduate from one of those programs

912
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,559
you really would need to look below the

913
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,360
surface

914
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,440
of that heading to see what you're

915
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,000
actually getting

916
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,960
and it's just well a similar overall

917
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,080
picture but different

918
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,880
individual results for 10 programs that

919
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
we sampled from the us

920
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
so again quite a varied range

921
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,600
of balances across the picture of the

922
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
of the programs and what i should say is

923
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
in the us and the uk

924
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,559
cases we were sampling from different

925
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,399
types of university it wasn't

926
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,480
all from let's say research intensive

927
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,679
universities or anything like that we

928
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,760
were trying to get a suitable sample

929
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
geographically and in

930
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,080
terms of nature of organization but the

931
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,039
key thing was

932
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,640
they're all selling the same program

933
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,080
title

934
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,159
okay certainly when you look at the

935
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,399
coverage of red

936
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,279
areas the non-cyber security coverage

937
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,000
certainly

938
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,960
having coverage of those wider topics is

939
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,039
going to be relevant having knowledge of

940
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,360
beyond just cyber security is relevant

941
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,600
for a cyber security practitioner for a

942
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,640
professional

943
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,039
um because yeah okay you're going to be

944
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,679
applying

945
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
cyber security within those contexts and

946
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
relating to those

947
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,960
technologies and implementations but

948
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
having half of your program devoted to

949
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
covering those topics

950
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,559
rather than something that's

951
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,559
specifically about cyber security

952
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
perhaps seems excessive if you're

953
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,159
dealing if you're presenting

954
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,799
a one-year post-graduate program that's

955
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,200
that's

956
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,840
named cyber security and perhaps it's

957
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,279
not what the employers would be

958
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,480
expecting to get

959
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,840
as a result so okay

960
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
um what does that mean it means you

961
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,760
can't perhaps we knew this anyway

962
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
you can't just or you're not to just

963
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
judge the book by its cover

964
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,919
you need to understand a bit more about

965
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,200
what you're going to get

966
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
and again using a uk reference point

967
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,720
here we have

968
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,200
um so-called certified degrees from our

969
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,519
national cyber security center so you've

970
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:29,840
got

971
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,480
a degree certification scheme for

972
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,440
undergraduate programs and for masters

973
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
for ones that specialize in cyber

974
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,720
security for ones that

975
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,679
have some cyber security content but

976
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,640
broader

977
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
computing coverage well all of the

978
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,159
programs that i've just presented would

979
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,080
be ones that would be expecting

980
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
to be certified as general masters in

981
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
cyber security

982
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
but again they would map to this

983
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
certification in very different ways

984
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,559
so what do employers actually want i'm

985
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,880
actually looking at this list again from

986
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
what a version of the irc squared's

987
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,320
workforce study this one from a couple

988
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,799
of years ago because the most recent

989
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
versions of the study don't actually

990
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
present this particular result

991
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,240
um but back in 2018 well actually

992
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,640
undergraduate and postgraduate degrees

993
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,279
they're the

994
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,799
the least valued um according to the

995
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,559
respondents in this particular case

996
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,159
doesn't mean of course that they have no

997
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,480
value but they're perceived to be less

998
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,679
important than

999
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,320
top of the list unsurprisingly uh

1000
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
relevant work experience and then

1001
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,559
further not too far down the list

1002
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,679
cyber security certifications so having

1003
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,440
that the industry professional

1004
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
practitioner

1005
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
certifications thing like suspensionism

1006
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,279
ch those sort of things

1007
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
and perhaps part of the reason for that

1008
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,000
is some of those certifications

1009
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,440
holding them is perhaps a proxy for

1010
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
indicating that you've got practitioner

1011
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
experience

1012
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,960
because some of them you can't get the

1013
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,919
certification

1014
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,919
unless you've been in practice for a

1015
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,560
certain amount of time as we shall see

1016
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
okay so employers certainly they're not

1017
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,599
looking at

1018
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,639
academic degrees as their primary focus

1019
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,560
so wherever these different things fit

1020
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
in together

1021
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,399
at our different levels of what they

1022
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,159
might be providing to us our

1023
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,800
different levels of focus on coverage

1024
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
and specialization

1025
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,599
so a rough guide to it would be

1026
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,359
something like this so our academic

1027
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,560
qualifications

1028
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,879
at the top of the diagram here not to

1029
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,839
suggest that they're

1030
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,879
better because they're at the top

1031
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,159
they're just different from what's at

1032
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,760
the bottom but they've got a fairly

1033
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,960
broad focus

1034
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,119
um whereas something at the bottom of

1035
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,079
one of our more

1036
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,839
vendor or technology specific

1037
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,119
certification like a

1038
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,760
cisco cyber security specialist is going

1039
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,679
to have quite a narrow focus in terms of

1040
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,560
its content

1041
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,639
perhaps down to a particular product

1042
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,159
type um

1043
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,520
whereas the skills that we're going to

1044
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,680
get from our academic qualifications

1045
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
well they're going to be a balance of

1046
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
perhaps general and theoretical

1047
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,320
not to say there's no practical skills

1048
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,839
and not to say there's no

1049
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,839
theory in the things at the bottom of

1050
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,440
the diagram but the balance

1051
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,200
would be expected to change you would

1052
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,440
expect an academic qualification

1053
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,880
to be talking about the wider context in

1054
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,839
which things fit in

1055
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,880
not just doing hands-on practical

1056
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,760
activities

1057
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,599
although again from the employer

1058
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,200
perspective that sometimes does seem to

1059
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,680
be

1060
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,480
what they want expect and often why

1061
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
academic qualifications tend to get

1062
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
criticized because

1063
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,480
the the graduates aren't necessarily

1064
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,440
walking out

1065
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
proficient practically in all of the

1066
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,359
technologies that employees would like

1067
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,160
them to be

1068
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,960
and that's where some of the

1069
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
certifications come in and of course

1070
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,880
actual professional development and

1071
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,520
experience

1072
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,400
so okay quick points to note before we

1073
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
move on

1074
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,680
of course cyber security knowledge and

1075
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,440
skills can be embedded within

1076
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
wider qualifications you don't just for

1077
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,640
example

1078
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
have to take an academic degree that has

1079
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,240
cyber security in the name

1080
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
you would hope and expect to find some

1081
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,520
coverage of the topic

1082
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
within wider computing and computer

1083
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
science for example

1084
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,599
and similarly within wider certification

1085
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,400
so a

1086
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,800
networking certification might still be

1087
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,160
expected to cover some aspects of

1088
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,440
network security

1089
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,480
within it um and similarly the

1090
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
the recognition of cyber security as a

1091
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
specialism as a

1092
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
particular sector within our industry

1093
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,200
doesn't mean that

1094
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,359
everything that relates to cyber

1095
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,480
security

1096
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
has to be done by a cyber security

1097
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
specific role we would expect

1098
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,880
people in other roles to also have

1099
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
knowledge awareness and responsibility

1100
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
for cyber security aspect relevant to

1101
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,240
their roles

1102
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,880
as well so this isn't meant to suggest

1103
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,359
that

1104
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,480
there's an exclusive path here but just

1105
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
to set the comments we will carry on on

1106
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,880
a more

1107
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
cyber specific focus in this talk

1108
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,560
so i mentioned i've actually mentioned

1109
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,839
some of the acronyms on the

1110
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,000
side here we've got numerous

1111
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
certifications that are out there

1112
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,960
numerous providers of them

1113
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
i've listed a few of the names that are

1114
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,960
more commonly encountered

1115
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,119
within the sector and that you may be

1116
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
aware of

1117
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
and again even amongst the few acronyms

1118
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,040
i've listed here

1119
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,280
there's different topic coverage

1120
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
different prerequisites

1121
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
in terms of experience to take and

1122
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,160
obtain

1123
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,400
the certification and different ways in

1124
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,160
which they're assessed and examined

1125
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,960
in order for you to gain it um so it's

1126
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,560
worth looking a little bit further at

1127
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
some of these distinctions

1128
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,400
so just taking three touch points our

1129
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,920
academic qualification as one example

1130
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,599
so if we think about what you need in

1131
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,200
order to to do that

1132
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
so a candidate needs to have typically

1133
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,040
some sort of qualifications for them

1134
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,920
to gain entry into a university program

1135
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
then they will study

1136
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
for however many years it is depending

1137
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,640
on whether it's undergraduate or

1138
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
graduate program

1139
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,480
um and they will be assessed by

1140
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,280
completing

1141
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,119
assessments generally the university

1142
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,720
itself has designed

1143
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,400
and different universities will assess

1144
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,240
different or the same topic

1145
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,400
via different assessments so it's not a

1146
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
completely homogenized approach

1147
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
something like security plus this is an

1148
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
example of a general

1149
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
entry level certification in security

1150
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
so somebody taking this doesn't need to

1151
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,440
have any prior

1152
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
experience as a practitioner and the way

1153
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,960
they're assessed ultimately

1154
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
after they've studied for it it's a

1155
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
90-minute exam

1156
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
based on multiple choice type questions

1157
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
in this particular case

1158
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,320
um and then there's sisp our certified

1159
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,200
information

1160
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
system security professional

1161
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
certification one of the more

1162
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,119
widely recognized ones in terms of

1163
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,320
adverts and things

1164
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,599
um for roles here

1165
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
candidates need to have five years

1166
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,280
cumulative paid full-time

1167
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,440
work experience in order to be able to

1168
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,800
get the certification

1169
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,040
and that need that experience needs to

1170
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,480
cover at least two

1171
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,839
of the eight topic domains within this

1172
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
common body of knowledge that isc

1173
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,880
squared has defined

1174
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
to support its certifications now of

1175
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,480
course

1176
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
what that actually means is somebody

1177
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,520
will have if you see two people with cis

1178
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,359
after their name they've got those post

1179
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,680
nominal letters what you will know

1180
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,240
is okay that person has passed the cis

1181
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,119
exam

1182
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,680
um and the exam for cis is somewhat four

1183
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,720
to five hours

1184
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,960
and quite a lot of questions within it

1185
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
and they'll also have got

1186
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
five years work experience in cyber

1187
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,839
security

1188
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,520
doing something that maps to the cbk

1189
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,160
but you won't know what domains their

1190
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
experience exists within without looking

1191
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,520
a little bit further looking at their

1192
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,119
resume looking at their cv

1193
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,720
to understand well what do they have

1194
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,480
experience in just seeing the post

1195
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
nominals

1196
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,599
doesn't tell you the detail of what

1197
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,960
their where their experience lies

1198
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
okay so just to give us a little bit

1199
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,079
more of a sense of some of the

1200
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,160
certifications that are around

1201
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,280
um here's here's just a few acronyms

1202
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,079
um well pretty much all of those are

1203
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,839
genuine there's one there that perhaps

1204
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,960
isn't a genuine

1205
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,119
acronym um now if we had time and

1206
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,240
particularly if we were in a room

1207
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,960
together

1208
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,200
i'd say to you i'd give twenty dollars

1209
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
to anybody who can actually tell me what

1210
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,400
all of those acronyms

1211
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,920
stand because i couldn't tell you what

1212
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
they all stand for without looking them

1213
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,680
up

1214
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,520
um and i think what that creates is a

1215
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
situation where we are

1216
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,240
potentially quite confused

1217
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
um particularly if you think of an

1218
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,359
employer

1219
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,680
that is um looking to recruit somebody

1220
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,359
who do they understand unless they're

1221
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,440
specifically knowing already

1222
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,800
what they're looking for if they're

1223
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,319
presented with somebody who's got four

1224
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,160
or five of these acronyms

1225
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,400
after their name as post nominals how do

1226
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
they navigate their way through to

1227
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,040
finding

1228
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,760
what they need and if you want to look

1229
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
at this in a bit more detail there's a

1230
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
really good resource here

1231
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,440
uh to pull jeremy's uh site there and

1232
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,319
i'll i'll

1233
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,599
leave that up there just for a moment

1234
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,160
you can screenshot it take photographs

1235
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,200
or whatever

1236
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,560
but this this um basically chart

1237
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
is an interactive roadmap when you go to

1238
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
the site and you can hover over the

1239
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
the different certifications and see

1240
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
what they are and the requirements that

1241
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,119
they have

1242
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
you can see where you might be able to

1243
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
see if your eyesight is good

1244
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,160
that they've been color coded and

1245
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,599
grouped into different

1246
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,400
aspects of security specialization there

1247
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,280
across the top

1248
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,800
and then you've got multiple different

1249
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,960
certifications some of them that are

1250
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,720
very security specific

1251
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,800
and some of them where security is an

1252
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
element of the certification but not

1253
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,640
the full focus so you've got things like

1254
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,240
um cisco ccna

1255
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
buried um in amongst there amongst

1256
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
various other things as well

1257
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,680
so quite an interesting resource if you

1258
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,200
want to explore it more fully

1259
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
okay now having pointed out that you've

1260
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
got all these different

1261
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,440
types of certification let's go back to

1262
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,280
an example of one of these job ads so

1263
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,319
here we have

1264
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,800
an earlier job out for an infrastructure

1265
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,920
security manager

1266
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
they're going to pay 80 000 pounds which

1267
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,200
is not a bad salary

1268
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
in the uk uh many people would love that

1269
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,280
sort of salary and what do they want

1270
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,079
well they

1271
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,160
you know bachelor's degree they'd like a

1272
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,359
master's degree

1273
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,680
they'd like a certification and the

1274
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
certifications they list

1275
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,040
um they list ch the certified ethical

1276
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,480
hacker which is one a little bit like

1277
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,839
security plus you don't

1278
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,839
need to have any prior experience and

1279
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,839
you just need to pass

1280
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,800
an exam to get this certification and

1281
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,440
it's focused as the name suggests on

1282
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,599
ethical hacking so it's that sort of

1283
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
focus um

1284
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,119
sisp certified information systems

1285
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,560
security professional

1286
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,839
broad brush certification five years of

1287
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,079
experience required to get that one

1288
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,240
cism certified information security

1289
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,200
manager again

1290
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,760
about five years experience required

1291
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,520
focusing on security management

1292
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,480
activities

1293
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,359
so three different things and giac the

1294
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,880
global information assurance

1295
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,480
certification

1296
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,119
um well actually giac is a scheme

1297
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,319
there's about 50

1298
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,240
certifications that sit within that so

1299
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
you can have gx certified um

1300
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,720
penetration tested gx certified

1301
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,000
intrusion analyst

1302
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,480
lots of different specializations so

1303
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,160
those four things

1304
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,960
are equivalent so four things that

1305
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,040
aren't remotely similar

1306
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
or equivalent would be what they would

1307
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,160
like so

1308
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,400
perhaps suggesting that the advert those

1309
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,599
putting it together

1310
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
don't have a particularly specifically

1311
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,800
clear idea

1312
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,720
about what they'd like they would just

1313
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,839
like something

1314
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,599
um is the message you get from that i'll

1315
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,160
have 80 000 pounds on that basis

1316
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,560
okay so that's highlighting what i've

1317
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,800
just tried to draw out

1318
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,839
so where does the demand sit well as i

1319
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,040
mentioned earlier the

1320
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,440
the clear demand in most places that you

1321
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,599
look is for sis but in this

1322
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,359
drawing of my enterprise strategy group

1323
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,800
that we looked at earlier

1324
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,920
you can see here that cis is the one by

1325
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,400
far and away um ahead of the others so

1326
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,440
the others are

1327
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,160
well if we look at these ones we've got

1328
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,720
scissors

1329
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,760
security match one the um

1330
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,920
security architect um caesar um

1331
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,440
certified information security architect

1332
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,960
if i remember correctly

1333
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,800
no systems auditor what am i talking

1334
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
about use my brain

1335
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,119
certified information systems auditor um

1336
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,280
security plus which is the entry level

1337
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,079
thing and ch ethical hacker which is

1338
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,640
again an

1339
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,440
entry level certification so the

1340
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,680
entry-level ones less demand for them

1341
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,920
the more specialized auditor and

1342
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,359
security manager one

1343
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,200
less specific demand for them because

1344
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
they're more focused

1345
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
cis because it's that generalist

1346
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,920
certification

1347
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,599
that has an indication or

1348
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,359
it is the proxy for saying somebody's

1349
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,960
got five years experience

1350
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,760
in doing something that is one of the

1351
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,200
reasons i think this one

1352
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,040
comes out as quite a popular

1353
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,800
certification

1354
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,280
now that's all very well lots of people

1355
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,240
would like cis

1356
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,200
but in terms of supply in the market

1357
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,839
well there's less of those people around

1358
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,200
and this is something that i put

1359
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,920
together um based on some data

1360
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,960
that was on the cyberseek.org

1361
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,119
website um well probably about a year

1362
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,240
and a half ago

1363
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
when i actually did this so if you look

1364
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,800
now you'll see some different data

1365
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
i'd imagine but i i put this chart

1366
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,079
together based on

1367
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,400
what i saw at the time but i'm sure the

1368
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
overall picture won't be too different

1369
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,520
now and the ones i wanted to draw

1370
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,640
attention to

1371
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,839
were the um orange diamond d shape at

1372
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,359
the top there for cyst

1373
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,400
and the red square for security plus so

1374
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,599
what we can see is

1375
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,000
there's quite a high supply of people

1376
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,040
that hold

1377
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,240
security plus certification but there is

1378
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,280
relatively little demand for it compared

1379
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,119
to cis where there's high demand

1380
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,920
but fewer people actually be holding it

1381
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,960
and so

1382
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
there's an imbalance in terms of what

1383
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,880
what actually exists out there which

1384
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,920
helps to explain part of this skills gap

1385
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,560
or at least the gap in filling the roles

1386
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,040
because

1387
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,720
there aren't enough of the sort of

1388
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,040
people that industry would ideally

1389
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,079
think it likes to have

1390
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,440
and then we've got the relationship

1391
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,440
between these things so how do we

1392
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
understand how these things fit together

1393
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,119
so okay we've got skills

1394
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,079
that um support the the notion of having

1395
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,359
certifications

1396
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,680
that certifications then denote certain

1397
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,520
skills are being held

1398
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,599
in terms of the roles that we want to

1399
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,680
hire people into well having skills

1400
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,280
enables us to do the roles

1401
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,480
roles require certain skills and the

1402
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,079
dotted line is indicating well what

1403
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,359
we're actually using as

1404
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,280
employers quite often is the

1405
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
certification as

1406
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,839
our means of understanding does the the

1407
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,280
certification holder

1408
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,440
have the skills that we would need to

1409
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,560
support the roles

1410
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,119
we're trying to hire into okay so

1411
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,000
certain occasions

1412
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
enable roles potentially in the roles

1413
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
potentially requires certifications

1414
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,920
what it's really about is the skills and

1415
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,359
the certifications are

1416
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,480
is our proxy again

1417
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,560
so trying to draw this waffle to a bit

1418
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,160
of a close

1419
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,560
what it is important to recognize is

1420
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,880
that yeah this topic has a breadth of

1421
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,480
skills being needed

1422
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,040
and we need to ensure as organizations

1423
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,520
that we

1424
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,680
cover off the bases that are relevant to

1425
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,960
us

1426
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,040
a natural way to do it is to look for

1427
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,960
the suitable certifications or

1428
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,880
qualifications that we think

1429
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,000
denote what we need but if that's to

1430
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
work we need to understand

1431
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,720
what these certifications represent we

1432
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,000
need to understand what the

1433
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,240
qualifications have actually covered we

1434
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,920
we need to have some sort of more

1435
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,079
granular understanding rather than just

1436
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,920
looking perhaps at the label

1437
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,720
um if we have a siloed approach to cyber

1438
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,200
security if we focus too much effort in

1439
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,640
just the technical or even just the

1440
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,960
non-technical although the latter is

1441
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,599
less likely to happen will be actually

1442
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,240
limiting

1443
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,079
the protection we can achieve what we

1444
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,480
want is this range of skills to be

1445
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,440
represented

1446
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,000
either internally or brought in if we if

1447
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
we can't sustain them

1448
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,200
ourselves within the organization and

1449
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,680
working together to provide the coverage

1450
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,520
that we require

1451
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,800
but even when we've understood the

1452
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,760
problem

1453
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,240
actually finding the people who've got

1454
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,280
skills that we need

1455
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,520
could still be a challenge but at least

1456
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,599
having a realistic understanding of what

1457
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,480
we're looking for

1458
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,119
will be a good starting point so i think

1459
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,640
where organizations are

1460
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,000
continually looking for people who've

1461
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,079
got the magical three to five years

1462
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,359
practitioner skills

1463
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,720
well if there aren't enough of those

1464
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,400
people around have a relevant

1465
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,319
understanding of what a less experienced

1466
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,040
person

1467
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
could be hired in with and how you could

1468
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
support them to grow the skills would be

1469
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,240
a relevant

1470
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,599
thought in mind okay a few references

1471
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,280
for some of the things i've drawn upon

1472
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,359
so this uk

1473
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,520
labor market studies where i got that

1474
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,559
different

1475
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,920
measures of confidence from the

1476
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,079
organization in technical governance and

1477
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,160
communication skills amongst other

1478
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,800
things

1479
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,720
there's about 85 pages in this

1480
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,400
particular study so a lot of

1481
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,960
interesting information within it and as

1482
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,640
you might see on the document there is

1483
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,760
one that i helped

1484
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,079
to contribute to and another couple of

1485
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,680
things from well not only myself but

1486
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,240
also

1487
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,319
matt bishop from uc davis we did a

1488
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,599
couple of papers

1489
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,440
um looking at the these issues and

1490
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,800
that's where those colored

1491
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
charts with the comparing the security

1492
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,240
frameworks and comparing the

1493
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,839
qualifications the msc

1494
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,319
programs in the uk and the us came from

1495
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:26,880
today's

1496
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
this one in computer fraud and security

1497
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,359
and this one from the world conference

1498
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,200
on security education

1499
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,400
last year and one final thing

1500
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,119
just to wave the flag particularly for

1501
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,359
staff journal computers and security

1502
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,599
here's a briefing paper that we

1503
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,480
published from

1504
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,760
ifip tc 11 talking about this particular

1505
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,240
issue

1506
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,400
and computers and security are kind

1507
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
enough to publish these tc 11 briefing

1508
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,200
papers so

1509
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,480
that's a good place to look and that

1510
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,400
one's freely available for you

1511
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,599
online and other than that that's me

1512
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,200
finally finished talking

1513
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,520
contact details there and happy to have

1514
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
a go answer any questions

1515
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,800
assuming the connection has actually

1516
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
held up and you're still there

1517
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,119
we are still here excellent

1518
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,640
do you have the q a icon in your

1519
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,240
um bottom menu bar there

1520
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,720
um yep so i've got the q and a things so

1521
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,800
i've got um

1522
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,960
okay so i've got one question i can see

1523
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,160
which is um

1524
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,079
how do we repair the damage caused by

1525
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,680
cysts or the people who

1526
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,119
crack the test without an in-depth

1527
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,280
understanding of the core principles so

1528
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
what do we mean by the damage caused by

1529
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,319
sift can we

1530
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,880
combat the questioner elaborate upon

1531
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,119
that

1532
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,800
here's the question there krazmir can

1533
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,240
you unmute and

1534
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,520
add to that

1535
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,599
ah security is preventing them they

1536
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,480
don't have permission

1537
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,280
censorship so yes

1538
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,680
what i mean is the following um very

1539
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,319
often we have people that have css comma

1540
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:12,960
css

1541
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,040
behind their name because they cannot be

1542
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,200
in a phd for example or anything else

1543
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,160
meaningful

1544
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,079
and those are the people that come in a

1545
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,359
company as a consultant

1546
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,760
and cause a lot of damage by uh

1547
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,559
basically

1548
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,240
um speaking out of authority and um

1549
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,319
recommending things that they're just

1550
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,920
not appropriate now i have been a

1551
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,520
consultant for many years i have been in

1552
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,800
industry for

1553
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,880
over 20 years all kinds of different

1554
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,160
levels and

1555
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,880
this pattern is consistent actually i

1556
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,960
have learned to trust people that

1557
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,119
don't put the cssp in their title and

1558
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,640
you can see them somewhere at the very

1559
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,119
bottom

1560
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,400
in like a additional miscellaneous facts

1561
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,839
you know those are the people i i

1562
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,280
normally trust but the ones that you say

1563
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,400
has been titled

1564
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,079
are appear to be particularly dangerous

1565
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,920
yeah so it's an interesting question i

1566
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,520
mean i wouldn't go as far as to assume

1567
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,559
that everyone who

1568
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,440
chooses to list cis for the post nominal

1569
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:05,760
um

1570
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,400
is implicitly untrustworthy but equally

1571
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,559
i don't think the mere presence of

1572
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,359
that after somebody's name is a

1573
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,920
signifier of anything other than they

1574
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,920
they you can assuming from that as i

1575
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,760
mentioned they passed the exam so they

1576
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,559
got some

1577
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,720
broad knowledge of security principles

1578
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,240
that the syllabus

1579
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,920
taught them and they got some

1580
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,240
practitioner experience of something

1581
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,280
what it doesn't confirm in any sense

1582
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,400
is that they are a professional security

1583
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,599
practitioner so holding the set holding

1584
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,359
any certification or any

1585
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,599
qualification doesn't denote a

1586
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,359
professional approach it doesn't

1587
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,079
it doesn't denote competence so you

1588
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,440
might well have the knowledge you might

1589
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,960
well have the skills

1590
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,000
but it doesn't prove that you can enact

1591
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,480
those

1592
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,720
in a competent and professional manner

1593
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,760
um there's not

1594
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,079
in any sense um denigrates set holder

1595
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,119
and say that they are

1596
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,760
unprofessional by default either but

1597
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,280
what is what it means is you shouldn't

1598
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,240
be assuming

1599
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,640
just from that something that it's not

1600
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,839
actually telling you

1601
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,839
so i think it is better you know okay

1602
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:10,960
you want to hire somebody

1603
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,760
as a consultant look at their track

1604
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,599
record what where have they consulted

1605
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,680
before do they have recommendations

1606
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,800
from the previous um employers so to be

1607
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
the previous people they came in for

1608
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,359
and did they do a good job don't just

1609
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,960
assume that because they're they're

1610
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,200
waving a flag to say they've got assist

1611
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,720
that um

1612
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,000
that that is fit for purpose

1613
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,920
oh yeah i i i do i do agree with you

1614
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,440
what you're saying uh what i'm saying is

1615
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,000
that there's

1616
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,400
at least in my uh in my experience the

1617
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,440
the people that

1618
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,359
that wave it behind their name usually

1619
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,880
are the ones that uh that

1620
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,440
that are the problem and you know for me

1621
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,000
um

1622
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,880
you know maybe i'm more uh conservative

1623
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,000
uh but for me

1624
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,240
uh it's just inappropriate to have those

1625
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,520
you know something that takes a

1626
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,680
four-hour exam and like really

1627
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,319
not not much experience because you know

1628
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,200
in most cases

1629
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,040
they don't even validate the experience

1630
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,800
and also could be you know is it five

1631
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,920
years of experience

1632
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,240
or is it the same the same year repeated

1633
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,319
five times right

1634
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,760
and you know i personally uh see

1635
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,240
uh things like you know advanced degrees

1636
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,079
where you have to go through

1637
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,400
the rigor of multiple different you know

1638
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,559
subjects you have to perform

1639
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,319
consistently throughout different

1640
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,480
disciplines and then you can put a

1641
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,040
degree

1642
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,280
behind your name you know and a title um

1643
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,119
i don't know i kind of

1644
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,720
think that as an industry we have a

1645
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,640
problem when we start

1646
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,520
developing education and putting uh

1647
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,960
craftsmanship level

1648
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,000
uh exams as a title in the name how do

1649
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,319
we deal with that

1650
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,319
but well i think you're right i think it

1651
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,160
it is a question syllab it's

1652
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,280
understanding what each thing actually

1653
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,079
represents

1654
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,920
and understanding how that matches to

1655
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,280
our needs so again with

1656
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,079
with as you say it's it's somebody's

1657
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,760
passed an exam and they've got

1658
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,839
they've got at least what it says on the

1659
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,240
tin five years of practitioner

1660
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,599
experience

1661
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,160
in something and yeah the almost the

1662
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,520
onus is on us then to

1663
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,520
to sort of look further and say well

1664
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,640
what is

1665
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,640
the practitioner experience in what what

1666
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,839
does their

1667
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,720
their cv their resume tell us that's the

1668
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,280
story

1669
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,799
i mean i agree with obviously i'm going

1670
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,319
to agree with you in terms of valuing

1671
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,200
academic

1672
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,359
education but equally you will get those

1673
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,880
concerns expressed by employers

1674
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,400
certainly it's a common story here in

1675
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,520
the uk

1676
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,559
criticizing computing graduates um

1677
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,640
as coming out of universities not

1678
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
holding the skills the

1679
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,040
the the experience that the employer

1680
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,400
would like to assume

1681
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,920
they're going to have and you know i

1682
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,280
would agree with you that they're going

1683
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:43,839
to have

1684
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,319
that broader knowledge base to draw upon

1685
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,559
a wider range of expenses it's not just

1686
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,119
about

1687
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,760
their hands-on technical and immediate

1688
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,720
deployability

1689
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,200
they are positioned to to do something

1690
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,839
further

1691
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,760
and they will need typically a

1692
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,520
combination of these things

1693
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,960
to actually position them as an

1694
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,200
effective practitioner

1695
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,960
um i mean i suppose you know in summary

1696
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,720
a lot of what i'm saying here is

1697
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,799
it's not just any one of these things

1698
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,640
and even if you know you look at them

1699
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,200
they're purely indicators the onus is on

1700
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,839
us to understand our needs more fully

1701
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,960
and to try and

1702
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,000
have a basis to do that mapping of okay

1703
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,400
here's a set of potential practitioners

1704
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,520
here are our needs

1705
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,040
how do the things gel together yeah

1706
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,440
if i hear correctly basically it's about

1707
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,200
educating the employers to understand

1708
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,359
what they're getting behind that label

1709
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,480
and again that that's kind of my

1710
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,079
question is how do we actually educate

1711
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:36,880
employers

1712
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,640
for them to be more cognizant of that

1713
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
but i i didn't mean to

1714
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,599
like dig in a call i mean it's enabling

1715
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,040
the employers because again we're not

1716
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,319
expecting all of them

1717
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,040
to be cyber security experts in order to

1718
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,880
hire a cyber security expert but what we

1719
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,760
need to have

1720
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,760
is perhaps more clear um specifications

1721
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,520
of different roles to indicate okay you

1722
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,200
want a certain you want this particular

1723
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,240
aspect of security

1724
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,400
um you need this sort of role it needs

1725
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,000
to have these sort of skills

1726
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,359
and this is the sort of thing that is

1727
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,920
beginning to emerge in terms of things

1728
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,960
like the nice

1729
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,079
workforce framework we've got in the uk

1730
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,880
a new uk cyber security council which is

1731
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,599
looking at

1732
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,640
um specifying career pathways and the

1733
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,000
knowledge and skills that help to

1734
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,720
support

1735
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,720
roles at different levels within those

1736
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,000
what do you think and i just want

1737
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,160
an add-on question uh i apologize uh but

1738
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,200
what do you think about

1739
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,359
maybe and i and i personally have mixed

1740
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,720
mixed opinion on this but

1741
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,880
uh in order to at least make the playing

1742
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,839
field level

1743
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,599
for for our graduates um if we implement

1744
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,440
uh maybe specialized trainings in the

1745
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,599
last year of their of their curriculum

1746
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,720
uh where we can maybe facilitate them in

1747
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
in passing some of those exams because

1748
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,160
even for the cassp

1749
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,319
even if it's a bachelor's degree that

1750
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,920
they can become at least the casp

1751
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,880
associate

1752
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,200
and be competitive on the job market as

1753
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,559
a result because i

1754
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,640
i really feel like people that put a lot

1755
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,480
of effort in studying and having

1756
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,079
consistent education

1757
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,599
are are not treated well just because

1758
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:10,880
somebody that has a little bit of

1759
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,520
craftsmanship skill that just happens to

1760
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,119
know this open source project or this

1761
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,400
open source project has an

1762
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,400
edge yes i've got mixed feelings about i

1763
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,359
suppose i would

1764
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,520
be quite happy to advocate it

1765
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,640
integrating it

1766
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,559
if you can integrate it without

1767
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,720
compromising something else that you

1768
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,400
wanted to cover or you actually feel

1769
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,839
would be better to cover

1770
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,680
as part of the degree program you're

1771
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,880
trying to offer

1772
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,720
and you know again if you let's say for

1773
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,559
the sake of argument you integrate

1774
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,280
ch into your program or you integrate

1775
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,680
the

1776
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,359
you know the exam component the

1777
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,760
knowledge component of cis

1778
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,680
is that the right thing for all of the

1779
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,200
the graduates will then

1780
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,720
emerge their doubt must be some that

1781
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,160
still emerge and now actually that

1782
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,839
wasn't the certification that this

1783
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,119
particular employer would have liked

1784
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,079
them to have or

1785
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,599
you know this employer would prefer them

1786
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,520
to have a more rounded academic

1787
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,880
education so you're never going to

1788
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,920
satisfy

1789
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,960
everybody no matter what you do and so

1790
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,680
it could be a a selling point it could

1791
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,000
be something that differentiates one

1792
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
academic degree from another we've got

1793
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,680
this certification embedded we've got

1794
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,400
that one

1795
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,880
but you still need to think as a as a

1796
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,720
candidate then on that program

1797
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,000
is that the certification that's going

1798
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,599
to be useful for the career that i want

1799
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,839
this is a i think this is a longer issue

1800
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:26,960
of uh

1801
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,000
philosophy of what a degree is and we we

1802
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,960
have this

1803
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,160
here the range between a liberal arts

1804
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,720
degree

1805
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,040
and a purely technical degree

1806
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,359
and as a conversation that hasn't been

1807
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,920
resolved in any meaningful way yet

1808
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,839
but that would be topic for another time

1809
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,160
um i don't see any other questions that

1810
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,640
have shown up

1811
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,760
so uh

1812
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,359
thank you so much steve it's a great way

1813
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,920
to tie up the end of the semester for us

1814
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,400
uh we appreciated a great deal and we

1815

much again for the opportunity sorry

1819
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,000
about the network connectivity issues at

1820
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,359
the start hopefully uh

1821
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,559
we got most of it and uh

1822
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,480
great to be part of it thank you i think

1823
