so welcome everyone to another of our

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,279
wednesday security seminars

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,600
and this week we're really fortunate to

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,480
have greg acres as a speaker

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,840
um i've known greg for over 30 years we

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,679
were just reminiscing a little bit ago

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,440
and he's been doing some cutting edge

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
security particularly in network

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
oriented security for all of that time

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
and longer

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,760
most recently he was a senior vice

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
president and cto

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,800
of advanced security at

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,040
cisco as part of the security and trust

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,280
organization there

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
he has experience as an executive as a

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,120
researcher

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
he's worked in technology he's worked in

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,399
managing a group

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,360
he's advised the government really there

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
aren't a lot of people who are as

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
familiar with the cutting edge

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,600
aspects of network and network

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
security as greg is and today he's going

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
to talk to us about a veritable

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
alphabet soup of uh networking

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760
technologies

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,199
in reading the title sdn

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
software-defined networks

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,200
nfv network function virtualization

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,520
ics internet control systems scada

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
cyber is not an acronym but we'll let

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
him tell about the rest of it so

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,520
greg thank you for being here please

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
take it away and again for the audience

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,119
if you have questions please post them

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,600
in the q

um appreciate the introduction um

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
you know staff i could say in some ways

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,360
i would tell you that cyber is a

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
four-letter word a lot of times at least

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,640
in my vernacular it is

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
uh and as you say i've been around it

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
for a long time

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
uh you know guys i i i would tell you

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
that i've worked a lot of the incidents

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
you probably have learned about over the

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
years

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
and i'll refer to a couple of them in

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,960
here when i was at cisco

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
for example i got brought in in the

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
target and home depot

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
attacks i was working peripherally in

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,878
the sony attack

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
so i was one of the guys that worked

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
both during the attacks

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
as well as the after effects of the

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
attacks and have had

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
exposure to a lot of the things that

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,560
people are seeing today

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
as sophisticated attacks in fact i've

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
been working solar winds

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
since that broke back in december uh

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
that was in my job at cisco

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
and i did a lot of different things in

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
the security space there my last job was

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
in a research and government program for

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
security and trust

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
today i spend most of my time advising

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
and consulting

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
with the johns hopkins university

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
applied physics lab

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
still at cisco sum a company called

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,840
cubic mission systems

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
they do kind of pointy edge of the sword

80
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,599
networks for the battlefield

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,840
and ships and things like that i also

82
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
work with a venture capital company

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,599
called

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,160
option three ventures i'm the acting

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
chief technology officer for a company

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
called veracity

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
industrial networks which is directly

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
applicable to the topic at hand today

89
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
uh and eliciting networks which is also

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,120
applicable to the the

91
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,560
the issues that handy and i'll mention

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
them as i go along

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
um i am going to pay attention to the q

94
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
a window i was advised by somebody last

95
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,440
night

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
to keep an eye on that because questions

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
can queue up there and it's hard to get

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,319
them

99
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
get them to a point of resolution at the

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
end of the talk i'm going to try to talk

101
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
for about 35-40 minutes and then leave

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,239
the remainder of the time for us to ask

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,200
questions

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
um i don't see well so if you see me

105
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,920
you know like i'm confused looking at

106
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,599
screens and moving my head around

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,200
it's because of my eyesight not because

108
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
i'm dish uh

109
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
disregarding your question uh and i will

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,799
try to keep an eye on the on the

111
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,760
question set uh

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
window here and make sure that i respond

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,879
where i can so what are we going to talk

114
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
about today i'm going to

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
give you guys a glimpse of what my term

116
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
paper was to my ceo

117
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
at cisco when i require retired about

118
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
three years ago

119
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,879
and i'm going to talk about what's

120
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
driving the network world these days and

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,400
also a little bit about

122
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
and staff already mentioned this a

123
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,959
little bit about software-defined

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,239
networks or function

125
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
network function virtualization zero

126
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
trust networks now i will tell you guys

127
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:08,720
that i

128
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
use the word sdn interchangeably with

129
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,480
nfv

130
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
at cisco we think sdn was something we

131
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,079
learned about early

132
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
and nfv was something that a competitor

133
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,680
named juniper learned about early

134
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
so my my background taught me to think

135
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
about these things as mostly sdn

136
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
i'll also talk about security-based

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,759
applications

138
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
the evolution of segmentation and zero

139
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,040
trust

140
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
something called moving target defense

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
and then the very last thing i'm going

142
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
to take just a quick look at the sdn

143
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
world

144
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
and what the attack surface looks like

145
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
there

146
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
as i said we'll take questions as we go

147
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
but i'll also try to leave time at the

148
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,759
end to cap

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,040
you know to capture any additional

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
questions or anything you might want to

151
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,280
have

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
um answered i'll also at some point

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
in the chat session post an email

154
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
address

155
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
that you can you can reach me at for

156
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
those of you that do know me you might

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
find it funny that my cisco email

158
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
account

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
that i've used for almost 30 years now

160
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
or i had used for almost 30 years is now

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
active again so you can send me mail

162
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
there it's gakers

163
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,160
at cisco.com or you can send me email to

164
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,280
great to gakers at

165
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,680
greggacresconsulting.com

166
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
either of those will work

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
so i'm going to take just a minute to

168
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
unpack this slide and

169
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
ask you to have a little bit of a dream

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
with me

171
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
many of you might recognize this is a

172
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,479
satellite shot

173
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
actually it's from cape canaveral in

174
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
florida and this happens to be the shot

175
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
in i think 2018 when spacex launched

176
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,680
a payload that carried an entity called

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
simon cimon an ai-based tool that was

178
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,039
sent to the iss

179
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
the international space station to be a

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
device that would actually help them

181
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,199
and help them learn to do things

182
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
and be a companion to the astronauts on

183
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,400
the space station

184
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,160
i picked this particular mission for a

185
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
reason this was a collaboration between

186
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
a university in munich ibm watson up in

187
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
upstate new york and nasa so there were

188
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
three principal collaborators

189
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,440
on this payload that went into space and

190
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
of course then you have

191
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
all the collaboration with the people at

192
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
spacex that launched the payload to the

193
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
iss

194
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
so i want you to step back with me for

195
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
just a minute and imagine

196
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
the level of security protection that

197
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
probably had to go into

198
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
all of that collaboration and

199
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
interaction over the course the months

200
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,840
and years leading up to that particular

201
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
one-time launch

202
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
where if someone had wanted to cause

203
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,319
something nefarious to happen during

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
that cycle of time

205
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
that all the opportunities that they had

206
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
so now fast forward maybe 15

207
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
20 years envision a time when that level

208
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
of complexity of collaboration

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
is not constrained by security it simply

210
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,160
is a means by which

211
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
it protects our communication it

212
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
protects our computation

213
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
and we just go into endeavors like this

214
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
and we start to collaborate we start to

215
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
communicate

216
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
and we are assured that we have secure

217
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
communication without really having to

218
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
have a second thought about or having to

219
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
have legions of people behind us making

220
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
sure that that works

221
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
so what i'm painting a vision for you is

222
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
the idea that in the future

223
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,240
security is just a basis of operation we

224
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
work from within

225
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
that fuels innovation allows

226
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
collaboration

227
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
and communication to occur without even

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
a second thought

229
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
i had an experience in the last couple

230
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
of weeks where one of my mentees at

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
cisco came and said greg

232
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
paint me a vision of 2040 in the

233
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
security world and i said

234
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
it's where this just happens we're

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
protected we're

236
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
we're assured and we don't have to even

237
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,120
have

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,639
a second thought about whether or not we

239
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
can communicate or we can collaborate

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
securely so imagine a world like that

241
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
and i think the things we're going to

242
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
talk about today

243
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
actually start getting us to that level

244
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
so what does the next

245
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
decade or a couple of decades look like

246
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
this was what i actually left behind

247
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
for our ceo at cisco and i said to him

248
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,639
terabit networks will become a reality

249
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
for everyone

250
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,960
terabit speeds even up to the point of

251
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,440
the end

252
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,720
device that we're working on enhanced

253
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
or augmented virtual reality will be a a

254
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
a part of

255
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
normal life we'll have a.i across the

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
board that supports life and quality of

257
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,039
life

258
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
you know we we all wonder about what the

259
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,240
world's going to be like in the face of

260
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
quantum computing and quantum

261
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,559
cryptography

262
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
this will be here today i don't know if

263
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
all you if any of you guys pay any

264
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
attention this is an area i pay a little

265
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,039
bit of attention to

266
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
there are announcements just about every

267
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,920
week of someone that's making some kind

268
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
of progress

269
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
in the quantum computation or quantum

270
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
crypto space

271
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
uh multi-dimensional environments will

272
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,600
be will be there

273
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
we'll store things rather than in

274
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
absolute bits and bytes

275
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,000
on ssd types of devices we'll store them

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
as actual images of holographic images

277
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
on storage to be able to retrieve them i

278
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
think by the time

279
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
and i don't remember where this number

280
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
came from by the time we get to about

281
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
2025

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,560
we're projecting a population globally

283
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
and of course these are pre-pandemic

284
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,959
numbers

285
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
that'll have eight billion people on the

286
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,240
planet

287
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
with roughly 80 billion connected

288
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,519
devices now my

289
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
my view again is that because of the

290
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
pandemic we may see that factor of

291
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
number of devices

292
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
uh actually escalate with what we've

293
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
seen but in terms of benefit because of

294
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,080
connectivity

295
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
if you doubt this number i'd encourage

296
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
you to go to whatever device you connect

297
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
to

298
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
to get your your internet service at

299
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,640
your home and look at the number of

300
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,519
devices

301
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,040
that it keeps track of i do this

302
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
regularly on my own home just

303
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
mostly for security and integrity

304
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
purposes and i look at that and i look

305
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
oh my goodness you know i've added that

306
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
device my wife's added that device the

307
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
kids added that device

308
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
i mean it's just it's amazing the number

309
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
of connected devices we're beginning to

310
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
see

311
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
crop up in everyday life

312
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
and as we see it cropping up in everyday

313
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
life it's cropping up in business all

314
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
over the place

315
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
iot the internet of things is is here

316
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
it's it's absolutely

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
doing things today that you couldn't

318
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
even have imagined 10 years ago

319
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
as i said the company that i work with

320
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,000
veracity industrial networks

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
works in some of the most complicated

322
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,680
manufacturing environments i've ever

323
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,399
seen

324
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,320
and it's it's a foregone conclusion that

325
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
the devices the plc's the controllers

326
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
the robotics that are in those plants

327
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,399
are all connected they're connected via

328
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,519
ethernet and they are

329
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
they're connected in a way that they

330
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
could communicate as needed to the

331
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
devices that they have to communicate

332
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,360
with

333
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
to build things and do things and

334
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
measure things in ways we've never even

335
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
imagined before in the picture here

336
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
you see deployments in devices that fly

337
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
uh you know we were talking about the

338
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
wind tunnels a little bit or sorry the

339
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,839
wind

340
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
uh mills a little bit earlier in your

341
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
halls area uh they're in they're in

342
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
those kinds of

343
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
manufacturing and iot environments

344
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,279
they're in the uh

345
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
the oil field they're in the oil uh

346
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,360
tankers out on our

347
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
platforms out in the ocean we're

348
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,920
connected everywhere

349
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
so all this is driving us towards a

350
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,519
world of virtualization

351
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,640
by virtualization i mean the notion that

352
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
we can deploy

353
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,600
our devices we can deploy our resources

354
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
we can deploy our com compute our

355
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
computing resources

356
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
anywhere we need to virtually in the

357
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
cloud at the edge

358
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
in core centers anywhere we would decide

359
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
that they needed to be placed

360
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
i i offer this word cloud as just a way

361
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,079
to kind of think about the things we

362
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,880
hear about

363
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
and talk about every day and the things

364
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,839
that we see people doing with

365
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
virtualization

366
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
as a result the network boundary is ever

367
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
exploding and ever increasing

368
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,360
i i can remember a day when we thought

369
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
about getting data into the data center

370
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,399
and putting

371
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
internet connectivity in the data center

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
as a matter of fact that was actually

373
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
one of the things that originally

374
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
attracted me

375
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
to go to cisco was because they were

376
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,639
actually deploying

377
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,200
tcp networks in the data center and

378
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
combating

379
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
people like ibm that were trying to keep

380
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,279
it out

381
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
but what's happened since then is we've

382
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
just absolutely blown

383
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,120
the use of the protocols and the use of

384
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
the connectivity

385
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
to all the far reaches of the world and

386
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
in fact every time i turn around and

387
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,920
talk to a company

388
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,639
i find internet technologies

389
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
internet-based protocols being used in

390
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,200
places

391
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
i never imagined before i think one of

392
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
the funniest things i've heard recently

393
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
i'm sure you guys saw some of this

394
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,440
in the uh in the social media rags there

395
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,519
was a doctor

396
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
that i believe had a uh court case that

397
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,920
he had to zoom into

398
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,600
and he was a plastic surgeon so he

399
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,959
decided he couldn't

400
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,560
delay either so he went ahead and did

401
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
the plastic surgery at the same time

402
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,079
he zoomed into the court case and i

403
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
think he was chastised by the judge

404
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
and told to go back to to do his plastic

405
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,760
surgery and he get

406
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
on the zoom on the zoom call later for

407
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
the case now

408
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
there's no reason to believe that not

409
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
only could he have not been a part of

410
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
the zoom call

411
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,160
for the case but he could have been

412
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
using other advanced technology for

413
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
remote

414
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
control of things that were going on in

415
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
that particular operating environment

416
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
so as we extend the enterprise these are

417
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,000
the objectives people want to think

418
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,800
about

419
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
they want to push the borders of that

420
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
network to all the edges of their

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
environments

422
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
every place they go every asset they

423
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
have every transaction they engage in

424
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
they want to provide connectivity

425
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
they want to reduce risk and apply

426
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
security appropriately

427
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
they want to do it with speed and

428
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
agility so they can take advantage of it

429
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
both from a a competitive standpoint but

430
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,399
also

431
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
from a standpoint of of making new

432
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
things happen for their customers

433
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
compliance and regulations can be met

434
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
innovation and different

435
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
differentiation

436
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,800
i'm reading a question that just came in

437
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
it says uh it's from crazy it says how

438
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,600
do we testify our zoom calls

439
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,399
in the age of eep fakes

440
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,320
we don't do it very well today and in

441
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
fact i would argue that i use the word

442
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,519
zoom as a verb and i personally believe

443
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,160
that

444
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,519
there are better tools out there that

445
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
can do this but i think one of the

446
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,199
things we have to start thinking about

447
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,480
and one of the things especially we have

448
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
to think about in the world in the word

449
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,240
in the world of advanced ai is how we

450
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
explain the technology we're using

451
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
is behaving the way it is so i'm

452
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,360
spending a lot of time right now with ai

453
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,160
people

454
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
that are talking to me about how to do

455
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
how to derive benefit

456
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,800
and conclusions from computation and

457
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
delivering results to people but at the

458
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
same time that they deliver results

459
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
they derive an understanding of the

460
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
explainability and the assurance

461
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
of the result they deliver that at the

462
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
same time so

463
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
my point is we've got the opportunity oh

464
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,160
i'm sorry that was filthy deep thanks

465
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,199
we've got the opportunity to uh to

466
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
actually

467
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,680
create a computational and communication

468
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,639
environment

469
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
where it can be a part of the assurance

470
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,839
of the integrity of what it is we're

471
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
doing

472
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
so as we extend the enterprise what

473
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,959
challenges do people care about

474
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
well we've talked about security

475
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
concerns they're always there

476
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
i would tell you in many places where

477
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
i'm working with ot providers there's a

478
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
lot of collaboration going on between

479
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
the information technology components of

480
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,959
companies

481
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
and the ot components of companies now

482
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,160
what i'm seeing going on

483
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,279
is actually many companies defining

484
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
two different groups to do two separate

485
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
things and then having to come together

486
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
together and collaborate i predict over

487
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
time that'll go away and we will end up

488
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,240
having

489
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,079
one single group that deals with cyber

490
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,279
security in the it and the ot world

491
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
simultaneously people are also caring

492
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,399
about how

493
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
how cost effective how and how

494
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
beneficial it is to the business

495
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
uh does it provide an roi does it reduce

496
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
control and complexity problems

497
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,839
and does it improve our overall business

498
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,959
processes

499
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,600
so as network architects and security

500
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,320
architects

501
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,839
what do we have to think about let's see

502
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,160
all the typical stuff can we prepare for

503
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,519
the future are we on time

504
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,800
are we within budget are these things uh

505
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,320
doing the things we want them to do

506
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
through our design choices are in our

507
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,199
options

508
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
uh are they industry best practices so

509
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,320
we won't be

510
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
accused of not bringing the best tools

511
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,519
to the to the fight

512
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,040
these are all things that we deal with

513
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
when we start doing network designs

514
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
so one of the tools that many people are

515
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
using today is something called software

516
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,040
defined networking

517
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,399
and i'm going to take just a minute here

518
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
again i'm not going to drain this slide

519
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
but take just a minute here and talk a

520
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,839
little bit about what software divine

521
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
networking is

522
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
it is an attempt basically to separate

523
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
the control layer of of the network and

524
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
the data layer or the infrastructure

525
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
layer of the network

526
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,079
and to provide a means by which

527
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
applications can take advantage

528
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
of that separation by interacting

529
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
directly with

530
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,359
the control layer and letting the

531
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,199
control layer that interact with the

532
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,280
the data layer and these are done by

533
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,559
these apis that are

534
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,199
i've demonstrated on this chart through

535
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,720
in the top chart through what we call

536
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,280
north bat

537
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,319
north southbound api

538
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
interactions or calls and then in the in

539
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,760
the other one

540
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,000
in the sec second part of the chart

541
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,839
southbound interactions or calls with

542
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
the network layer

543
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
now the point by doing this is that if

544
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,080
someone in some way abrogates

545
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
one of the layers they don't in fact

546
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
abrogate the intent or cause problems

547
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
with the other layers

548
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
so with the application layer we want to

549
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
provide those things that are going to

550
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
be beneficial to the application

551
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
we want to implement logic for flow

552
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,960
control at the

553
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
control layer we want to implement

554
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
things that are a part of the kernel

555
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
or control aspect something we want on

556
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
applications to control flows going on

557
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,480
the network

558
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
and at the infrastructure layer that's

559
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
where our actual data moves around where

560
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
the data plane

561
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
is actually in the network switches or

562
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
routers that moves data from device to

563
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
device

564
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
and this is an architecture that came

565
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
out of the open network foundations

566
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,039
uh work that came out and something back

567
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
i think it was back in the

568
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,559
in the 90s that we we ended up bringing

569
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,919
out stanford

570
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,919
uh in the form of something called the

571
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,280
the big switch world

572
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
open and i'm going to talk about big

573
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
switch a little bit later

574
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
so when we think about that model what

575
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
happens when we think about the security

576
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
components well security is an app

577
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,880
becomes a pretty compelling thing now

578
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
what i'm talking about when i talk about

579
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,120
security as an

580
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
app it's an application that runs at

581
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
that higher level and interacts with the

582
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
middle and the bottom layer

583
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
through function calls through the api

584
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,200
the north-south apis

585
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
to do things like firewall scan

586
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
detection

587
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,039
prevention think about advanced malware

588
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,440
prevention denial of service detection

589
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,039
and prevention

590
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,760
intrusion detection and prevention deep

591
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,360
packet inspection

592
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
sandboxing and any other number of

593
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
things including ai and ml tools

594
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
in the cyber world that can interact

595
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
with the data that's going on at the

596
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,440
lower levels

597
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
so why does security as an app make

598
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,480
sense

599
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
well it can be very cost effective

600
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
it can also be easy to deploy because it

601
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
rides on top of that architecture

602
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
and it can be rich and flexible and

603
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,200
changed whenever the need might change

604
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
there's an example of this that came out

605
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
of the company big switch that i

606
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,679
mentioned a few minutes ago that was

607
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
acquired by arista

608
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,840
earlier this year and the app the the

609
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,200
architecture they came out with

610
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,160
something called

611
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,960
the big secure architecture so all the

612
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,520
all the

613
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
little the five icons at the top

614
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
represent the applications

615
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,520
that need to run on it they pass through

616
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,160
a general firewall that provides access

617
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
to the infrastructure to the control

618
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
plane and in that control plane we run

619
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
the jobs of ids ips

620
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,080
you know the things i mentioned on prior

621
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
page sandboxing dpi

622
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
and it provides us a place to do these

623
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
things very efficiently

624
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
and very fast and very and very

625
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,720
flexibly i would argue that we would

626
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,799
actually be able over time

627
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
to derive the ability to deal with

628
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
complex data flows as well as large

629
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
terabit data flows

630
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,760
with a model like this okay

631
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
let's go ahead now and talk about the

632
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
next topic which is segmentation

633
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
segmentation has been around for a long

634
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,600
time and i'm going to talk about that

635
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
but i've got three quotes up here one

636
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
from the us cert the people at uh

637
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
dhs cesa whom i spent a fair bit of time

638
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
with

639
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,720
people in australia the department of

640
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,600
defense information security agency

641
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
and at the bottom a quote from a company

642
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,559
called data guardian who's actually a

643
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
data loss prevention

644
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,679
provider they have their own products

645
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,240
that actually also say the best tool

646
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
to prevent data loss is actually to

647
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,919
segment data in places where it's not

648
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
accessible

649
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
to things that don't need it and that's

650
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
what segmentation is all about

651
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
segmentation is about the idea that we

652
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
can take things

653
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
that are needed for specific purposes

654
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,799
and

655
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,559
separate them from other things that

656
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,000
don't need them

657
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
so first thing i want to talk about is

658
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
the way we do segmentation

659
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
in the classic network world this is

660
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,480
through something called

661
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
static access control lists and the idea

662
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
behind this is if you look at the

663
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,559
at the congregation of users on the

664
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
bottom layer you've got iot

665
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
you've got voice video employee

666
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,720
supplier bring your own device people

667
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,240
and non-compliant devices that need

668
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
access

669
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
to corporate rese to corporate resources

670
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
as well as people in the

671
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
cloud and cloud resources so in the

672
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
world that we live in

673
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,159
we've lived in for almost 25 years

674
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,760
typically what those things are done is

675
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
through something we call access control

676
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,320
list

677
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
so for those of you that have never seen

678
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
an access control list i wanted to show

679
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
this to you

680
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,799
this is actually an access control list

681
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
out of a firewall

682
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
and while i didn't write this one at one

683
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,919
point in my career i made a living out

684
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,679
of actually writing this access control

685
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,320
list

686
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
in fact i was so paranoid about making a

687
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,679
mistake in this

688
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
kind of a morass of information that i

689
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,480
would write my access control list on

690
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,919
either side of the devices i was

691
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,880
protecting

692
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,120
so that they were complementary to one

693
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,039
another that if one access control is

694
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,760
failed

695
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
the other one would be sure to take it

696
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,520
up now you talk about a mind-bending

697
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,039
exercise where i was trying to create

698
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,840
this

699
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,640
boolean truth table on one side and the

700
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
contra positive on the other side

701
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
what i was actually doing was making

702
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
even more complexity and building more

703
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,200
complication into it

704
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
and creating more opportunity for error

705
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
in fact this is one of the things i

706
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
spend most of my time doing when i was

707
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,880
paid

708
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,799
to develop access control list was not

709
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
writing the list but actually debugging

710
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,919
them and for those of you that don't

711
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,559
know what this

712
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
is this is a list of protocols ip

713
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,320
addresses

714
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,919
network masks and ports that are used to

715
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,400
allow

716
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
deny or permit certain flows of data

717
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,799
between devices they become very

718
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,840
complicated

719
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,440
they become very cumbersome and they're

720
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
very difficult to apply

721
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
when when you're working in a world like

722
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,400
this you have to deal with

723
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
definitions and access control places

724
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,919
like the

725
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,559
active directory within policies in your

726
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
vlan environments

727
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
within your subnets then you have to

728
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,559
implement your policy in ankles you have

729
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
to apply them and test them

730
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
and then you have to go off and use all

731
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
the different tools that were out there

732
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,679
different interfaces to apply them and

733
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,000
in this world this ends up having about

734
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
about a dozen different touch points in

735
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
a fairly simple network architecture to

736
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
make something like this work

737
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
each one of these is fallible each one

738
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
of these is prone to error

739
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
error and human mistake and that's the

740
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
world we've lived in for quite some time

741
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,679
now

742
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
i would argue that the idea of applying

743
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,919
segmentation through things like sdn

744
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,600
and other tools gives us an opportunity

745
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
to move into a different world now macro

746
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,200
segmentation

747
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,919
is a way by which we actually could take

748
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,080
that same set of user requirements

749
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
and begin to map them together in the

750
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,919
light virtual uh

751
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,240
networks just like we do did the vlan

752
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,039
work in the act

753
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
in the ako list but we can actually

754
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,960
separate them so that we can prevent

755
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
the iot device from communicating with

756
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
that quarantined device

757
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,120
or that bring your own device component

758
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
of the corporate network

759
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,559
that we might need compute might need

760
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,320
compute with but we don't want to be

761
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,080
corrupted by now if you apply this over

762
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,240
a reasonably sized enterprise

763
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,840
this becomes fairly complex fairly

764
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,400
quickly but with the sdn world we can

765
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,200
actually do this

766
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
very very quickly and make it make it

767
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
work in a way that only those things

768
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,559
that need access to the corporate

769
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,679
resources

770
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
and the internet resources that they're

771
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,799
entitled to can become

772
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,120
can actually activate get access to them

773
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,559
now what we're going to talk about now

774
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,919
is the fact that okay

775
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,440
we've pulled things together but we've

776
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
got all these iot devices kind of lumped

777
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
into one thing

778
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
and the problem we've got is those

779
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
things that are that are put together

780
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,200
may not be

781
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
necessary for all the things that we

782
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,159
need to do to get our job done well

783
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,559
think about the situation that happened

784
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,360
for example

785
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,960
at uh at target target was the effect of

786
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,440
a

787
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
of a an attack that came in through an

788
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
hvac system

789
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
that attacked a point-of-sale system

790
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,039
that ultimately attacked

791
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
the the cash register system in the

792
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
stores

793
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
what if we could actually have separated

794
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
those iot devices and only allowed the

795
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,440
like devices

796
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,039
that needed to communicate to actually

797
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,720
communicate and prevent that lateral

798
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
spread

799
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,279
i would argue with you that if you go

800
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,640
back and you look at what we know about

801
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
solar winds so far

802
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
solar winds was there primarily to do

803
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
lateral spread in most environments

804
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
if we could have prevented that lateral

805
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,279
spread we could have mitigated much of

806
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,480
the damage there

807
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
and provided a way for us to control the

808
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
effect of that attacker

809
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,919
so now we go on to the next level of

810
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,520
segmentation something called micro

811
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,720
segmentation

812
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
in my opinion that's probably the

813
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
ultimate zero trust tool in fact

814
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
the company i mentioned earlier ellicity

815
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,799
does something they call

816
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,799
nanosegmentation which says every device

817
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,840
every mechanism on the network becomes a

818
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
segment unto itself let me show you a

819
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,240
little bit about

820
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
how this idea would work so we go back

821
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
to our original example

822
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,919
got all the devices in our collective

823
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
but we've got to focus on our iot

824
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,279
devices that are in the manufacturing

825
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,880
environment so we could build a

826
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
manufacturing vlan but let's just let's

827
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
just spend a minute talking about that

828
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
so if i focus on just those

829
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
manufacturing devices and we lump them

830
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
in with all the iot devices

831
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
we've got the problem i just described

832
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
that might have happened at target

833
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
where you've got devices that don't have

834
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,279
a reason to communicate with each other

835
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
in the same vlan

836
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,559
that are actually allowed to communicate

837
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,039
with one another in fact what we prefer

838
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,720
is to have an environment where

839
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
only the card readers can communicate

840
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,159
with each other

841
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
only the hvac system components can

842
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,200
communicate with each other

843
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,559
and only our very important

844
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,720
manufacturing environment components can

845
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,159
communicate with each other

846
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,840
and this is a tool that we can use in

847
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,279
the zero trust world

848
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,159
to make sure that we we remove lateral

849
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,360
lateral spread

850
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,440
of attacks in a way that we can actually

851
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
protect them

852
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,159
and i would tell you guys that that's

853
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,840
the way that i see a lot of companies

854
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
moving

855
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
to try to isolate what it is they're

856
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
doing i've got

857
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
i've got three or four other companies

858
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,960
that i work with that are moving towards

859
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
a model that says you know what the more

860
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
segmentation

861
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
and the more fine-grained segmentation

862
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,520
we could do the better off we are

863
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,039
okay i'm going to move on now and talk

864
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
about something that i i have learned a

865
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,840
little bit about over the last

866
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
five years called moving target defense

867
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,880
so again

868
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,640
trying to solve the problem of lateral

869
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
movement what if the attacker

870
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,760
lays down and tries to move into other

871
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
components within my network

872
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
but those devices and those services in

873
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
my network that are there

874
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
move around and change in ways they

875
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
can't keep up with them

876
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
the sdn controller becomes an ideal

877
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
place for this kind of

878
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
malleability to be built into the

879
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,320
network the idea is to provide flexible

880
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,679
infrastructure for developing and

881
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,200
managing obfuscation

882
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
of assets as well as eliminating

883
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
reconnaissance

884
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,760
and mitigating attack attacks

885
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
so the things that we talk about in the

886
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
mtd space

887
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
are things like random host mutation

888
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
random route mutation

889
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,960
where the host id the host ip address

890
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
changes

891
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
the host route changes network mapping

892
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,240
becomes very very difficult and

893
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
reconnaissance becomes a problem

894
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
and then at the end of the day you also

895
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,399
can provide ways to actually obfuscate

896
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,080
what services are on the network and

897
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,440
what operating systems are running on

898
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,320
the network

899
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
now the logical question to this slide

900
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
is well if i do this

901
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,240
what happens to the poor network uh

902
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
network engineer

903
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,799
and security engineer that have to

904
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,480
resolve problems on this network what

905
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,520
happens that

906
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,799
in that case is we actually ask the sdn

907
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
controller to make sure that it keeps

908
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,039
track of the state of the network at the

909
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,679
time of

910
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,000
particular incidents so that we can map

911
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
that into the

912
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,919
providing information to the network

913
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,520
engineer and the security engineer so

914
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
they can find their problems and fix

915
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,480
them

916
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
now the last thing i want to talk about

917
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,279
is the attack surface

918
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,080
so at the end of the day when we've

919
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,640
created

920
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
all this malleability and all this

921
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,559
variability in the network we've created

922
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:00,799
an

923
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
awful lot of places for people to

924
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
actually do

925
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
nefarious things and i want to make sure

926
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,679
that everybody remembers that

927
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,399
sdn functionality manage i'm sorry

928
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
moving target defense security as

929
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,360
service

930
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,840
loads an awful lot of software onto

931
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
components of the network

932
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,520
they load them in places that actually

933
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
the attackers could take advantage of

934
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
number one number two that amount of

935
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
software has to be thought about

936
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,919
as being a potential target in a place

937
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,000
that we have to be able to protect it so

938
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
things like secure development life

939
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
cycles where we can provide

940
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,000
good connectivity i'm sorry good

941
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
capability against the

942
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
the attack surface that we've created

943
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,279
with all that software becomes really

944
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,120
important the bad guys will look at

945
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,039
the controllers as being opportunities

946
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,320
they'll look at the flows

947
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
the north southbound flows the east west

948
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,640
flows as being potential

949
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,960
opportunities of targets of opportunity

950
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,480
they'll also be looking at

951
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
things like attacks where you can you

952
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,480
can actually provide

953
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,520
you know nefarious or other types of

954
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
uh counterfeit requests into an

955
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
environment like that so my

956
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
point by this slide is provide a a

957
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,360
cautionary note to all practitioners

958
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
when you start providing this amount of

959
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
software variability

960
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,039
in networks you're creating an awfully

961
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
large attack surface

962
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
in the software space you have to

963
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
mitigate you have to provide practices

964
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
and means by which to to mitigate those

965
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,559
things

966
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,480
okay guys i want to take just a minute

967
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
and say thank you for the time

968
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,320
i want to make a special special thanks

969
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,399
out to michael geller at cisco

970
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,480
dr duda at ieee and jhu apl

971
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,279
and dr kunsan at george mason university

972
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,320
for content

973
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,279
they provided in this in this deck i

974
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,600
also think we're about at the 30 minute

975
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,679
mark of my presentation time

976
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,520
so i'll go ahead and look in the in the

977
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,039
window for any other questions that

978
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
might be

979
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
that might be out there if there's

980
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
anything that i can

981
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,039
i can answer please go ahead and post

982
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,159
something there or

983
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,600
if there's anyone that's got access to

984
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
video or audio that wants to come on

985
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,279
and ask questions we can do it that way

986
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
too

987
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,720
well greg i can't type a question in

988
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,799
here but um

989
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,120
i i wanted to ask you what you thought

990
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,080
of

991
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,120
the potential for ai

992
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,320
expert systems to help in configuring

993
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
these networks to avoid some of those

994
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,799
those seams and attack locations is

995
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,399
and and what are the corresponding

996
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
dangers of trying to rely on those

997
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
i appreciate that staff that's that's a

998
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,640
great question in fact

999
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,200
i would tell you that my former employer

1000
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
has some products like that out on the

1001
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
market today and i see an awful lot of

1002
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,399
people working on things like that

1003
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,000
in the startup space so i think we're

1004
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,519
going to see more and more

1005
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,559
application of aiml tools in that

1006
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,760
control layer

1007
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,080
to manage those things manage them but

1008
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,919
also mitigate them i think they can be a

1009
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,559
part

1010
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,720
of the strategy to both identify and

1011
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
defeat attacks

1012
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,880
as they occur now that's all well and

1013
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,200
good

1014
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960
up to the point that someone starts then

1015
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,399
looking at

1016
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,200
those ai tools as potential attack

1017
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,000
points

1018
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
i think that's one of the things we

1019
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,799
always have to think about is when we

1020
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,640
implement

1021
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,679
ai and ml tools if we take away other

1022
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,799
attack vectors for

1023
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,399
attackers they're not going to just give

1024
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,440
up and go home they're going to turn

1025
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
around and look at it and go okay

1026
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,919
now i need to attack the ai and ml

1027
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,000
either by causing training problems

1028
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
or by train or by causing things to

1029
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,440
occur

1030
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,960
that had not been planned for and that

1031
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,399
goes back to one of the comments i was

1032
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,679
looking at i was

1033
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,480
mentioning earlier when we employ these

1034
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,360
tools

1035
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
one of the big cautionary notes is just

1036
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,039
like every other piece of software

1037
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
staff we've got to test it we've got to

1038
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,880
make sure that it does the things it's

1039
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
supposed to do both in the corner cases

1040
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,120
as well as in mainstream and we've got

1041
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,799
to provide explainability so people know

1042
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,120
how

1043
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
knows know how it's working um

1044
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
we've got another question here that

1045
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,159
says do the rise of the use of sdn

1046
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:16,880
change

1047
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,279
skill need for future network security

1048
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,559
engineers

1049
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,840
um i think it does i think it requires

1050
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
network engineers to also be able to do

1051
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,679
things like we just described use tools

1052
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,559
that are in the al

1053
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,840
ai and ml space i think it requires

1054
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
the network and security engineers to

1055
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,760
also have

1056
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,440
some more data science capability

1057
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,519
because we're going to be awash in data

1058
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,120
around networks over a period of time

1059
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
and they're going to need to understand

1060
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,840
how to go through the process of

1061
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,000
identifying that data that's useful

1062
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,919
and those things that are actually not

1063
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,080
useful

1064
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,840
next question i've got is am they're

1065
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,039
interested in methods tools and

1066
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,000
processes

1067
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,159
for rapid rapid definition of micro

1068
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,200
segmentation

1069
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,399
or just segmentation

1070
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,960
it's my opinion one of the biggest

1071
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
hurdles in implementing

1072
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,120
effective segmentation is the definition

1073
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
of ackles

1074
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,040
firewalls policies that traditionally

1075
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,560
have been fairly trial and error process

1076
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,918
i think your instinct is right and

1077
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,960
that's one of the reasons i included

1078
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,918
that slide

1079
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,440
that had that aqua list in it um

1080
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
i think here again we can do things in

1081
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,918
the ai and ml space to help test this

1082
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,359
but i think the other thing we just have

1083
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,040
to do is to begin to get

1084
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
begin to get regimented about how we

1085
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,879
test these things

1086
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
and and use standardized testing

1087
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,000
mechanisms

1088
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
in our environments to make sure they're

1089
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
doing the jobs they need to so

1090
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,960
i think you're right i think we need to

1091
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
do more and more segmentation

1092
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,000
um i would tell you that i believe that

1093
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,879
the power to do that is coming to us

1094
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,839
very quickly i think that we're going to

1095
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
see more computational capability at the

1096
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,679
edge i think 5g is inherently bringing

1097
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,359
that to us

1098
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
i think with that kind of computational

1099
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
capability at the edge we can

1100
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,000
run workloads to do more and more work

1101
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
in the segmentation space for protection

1102
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
than we've ever been able to do before

1103
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,640
in fact

1104
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
i mentioned the company earlier helicity

1105
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
that i'm a part i'm engaged with

1106
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,920
they actually do computational work to

1107
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,839
protect every entity in the network

1108
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,400
wherever it lives if it lives in a data

1109
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,839
center they protect in the data center

1110
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,880
it lives on the edge

1111
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,200
they protect it on the edge i think

1112
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,560
that's one of the things

1113
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,200
that we're rapidly getting uh getting to

1114
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
a point to that we'll just

1115
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
we'll be able to do the work wherever we

1116
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,359
need to do it

1117
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:44,560
any other questions

1118
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
well i'll ask one that

1119
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
might might be interesting

1120
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
how about home users right for us to

1121
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,520
install

1122
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,640
a typical home now has dozens of

1123
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,359
computing devices with networks

1124
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,960
what is the consumer market going to be

1125
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
like for us to be able to protect

1126
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,359
ourselves at home and

1127
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,800
how is the average person going to be

1128
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,640
able to manage the configuration of such

1129
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
items

1130
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,839
all right well let me let me pull a play

1131
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,599
out of the playbook of what i use at my

1132
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,359
home and that way i mean i'm not

1133
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,720
i'm not concerned about telling

1134
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,359
everybody um i'm a big believer in

1135
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
security appliances that sit

1136
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
in a position in the network that can

1137
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
protect everything

1138
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,800
subordinate to that portion that portion

1139
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
of the network so

1140
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
and the reason i believe these are

1141
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
things that are useful is you can

1142
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
control them

1143
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
through standardized interfaces through

1144
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,599
cloud-based

1145
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,320
tools and and so what i'm using in my

1146
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
home is actually a device

1147
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,920
that comes from my former employer it

1148
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,359
was an acquisition they made from a

1149
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,040
company called meraki

1150
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,040
and on that meraki device i run ids ips

1151
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,760
firewall vpn concentration

1152
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,240
advanced malware protection and i

1153
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,359
actually do

1154
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,920
sandbox runs and scans on it that's gets

1155
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
sent to the cloud

1156
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
and then what's presented back to me

1157
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
every day or by exception

1158
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,160
are those things that are problems and i

1159
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,839
go look at and you know i admit i'm a

1160
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,320
little bit

1161
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,000
probably different than most of the

1162
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,359
people that are out there but i think

1163
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,560
we'll see

1164
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,880
and as faf i think this is just by way

1165
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,079
of an example

1166
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,520
of what we're doing today or what's

1167
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
capable of being done today we'll see an

1168
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,000
evolution

1169
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
of this going forward i think we'll see

1170
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
more and more of these tools

1171
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,920
where you'll have a capability that will

1172
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
sit in a place

1173
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
in your network to defend the network

1174
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
and it will be

1175
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
kind of like your assistant to do it and

1176
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
i've actually said this to somebody

1177
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,839
you know what if at the time that we

1178
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,520
were building a whole network

1179
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
we were assigned a software assistant to

1180
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
help us defend and protect that tool or

1181
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
that

1182
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
that network with a set of tools that we

1183
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
knew we could rely upon from the point

1184
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
that we laid it down

1185
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
to the point that we de-installed it i

1186
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
think those are the kinds of things

1187
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,359
we're end up seeing over time i think

1188
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,800
we'll see that happen

1189
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,320
uh more and more we're getting more and

1190
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
more computational capability in those

1191
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,119
devices

1192
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,760
we're getting more and more bandwidth uh

1193
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,359
you know i think it's important to think

1194
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,960
about the world when we get to a point

1195
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,920
that we've got

1196
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,079
that kind of capability and to the point

1197
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,440
we were making earlier

1198
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
with the situation we've seen with the

1199
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
pandemic and everybody working from home

1200
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
people need that enterprises have rushed

1201
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
to get those kinds of capabilities in

1202
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,599
the hands of the workers at home they've

1203
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,680
got two options they can either do it

1204
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,560
on premises at the worker's home or they

1205
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,480
can vpn everything that the worker does

1206
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,839
back to the vpn

1207
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,160
concentrator at the office and let the

1208
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
security team there do it and they've

1209
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
done a little bit of both

1210
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
from what i can tell so to answer your

1211
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,560
question staff i think where we are is

1212
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
we're going to end up with tools

1213
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,640
that'll sit at that home network edge

1214
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,960
and will grow with us over time

1215
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
you know frankly i think we'll see ai

1216
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
and ml tools there as well

1217
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,440
you know the sandboxing example i use

1218
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
with meraki devices

1219
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,839
that i was talking about actually does

1220
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,200
that automatically

1221
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
it detects things that it thinks are

1222
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
malfeasant at the edge

1223
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,720
sends them to the threat grid sandbox

1224
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,839
blows them up

1225
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
analyzes them and reports back whether

1226
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,960
or not there's a problem

1227
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
and it's actually very good at what it

1228
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
does i think we'll see more and more

1229
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,520
tools like that

1230
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,000
in the home environment does that answer

1231
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,160
the question

1232
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,640
i think so i'm i'm i was specifically

1233
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,760
thinking of

1234
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
someone like my my neighbor who has no

1235
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
technological background

1236
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,839
and is adding they've got a smart tv

1237
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,920
they've got appliances with

1238
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,160
network connections as well as their

1239
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,480
cell phones and computers

1240
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,760
and they need protection but

1241
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,040
don't have the sophistication to look at

1242
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,119
for instance threat reports that are

1243
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,200
coming back and to know

1244
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
uh how they should configure something

1245
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,480
they want it to work

1246
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
because they're buying these devices but

1247
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,160
they deserve protection at

1248
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,760
a home interface so i think your answer

1249
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
addresses that partially but there's

1250
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,320
likely to continue to be a skills gap

1251
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,200
between

1252
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,079
what's provided and what the uh the

1253
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,599
homeowner for instance is going to be

1254
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,720
able to supply

1255
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,079
i think you're right i think what we'll

1256
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,800
see is more and more software to do that

1257
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
sort of thing so for example

1258
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
i deploy these devices i've described to

1259
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,119
you with some of my friends

1260
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
and i rely on the ability of the of the

1261
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
tool to do most of the work

1262
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,880
uh you know one of the things that i

1263
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,839
would tell you is that

1264
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
people have have just now begun to

1265
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,680
realize that when they

1266
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
create an environment like you just

1267
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,640
described in the home environment

1268
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
they create that problem that we were

1269
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
describing earlier about the lack of

1270
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,640
segmentation

1271
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,960
most home environments today you can

1272
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,560
actually establish

1273
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,520
separate broadcast collision domains

1274
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,400
separate

1275
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
wi-fi ssids separate things that people

1276
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,440
can actually do to provide

1277
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
segmentation and this is the same

1278
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,359
problem that they've got

1279
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,119
you know we've got we we don't segment

1280
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,640
anywhere else if you don't

1281
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,280
then you've got the smart tv causing a

1282
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
problem with the

1283
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
with the enterprise connected device

1284
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,319
they use for their

1285
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,760
their home office and things like that

1286
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,000
so i think what we'll see over time

1287
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,760
is better tools smarter tools

1288
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,359
cloud-based offerings that'll help with

1289
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,800
those sorts of things i mean you know

1290
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
let's go back to the notion of security

1291
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,839
uh security function virtualization

1292
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,440
you could take most of those things and

1293
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,040
buy them as a consumer

1294
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
either for a service provider or from a

1295
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,560
consumer service

1296
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
in the cloud and implement them mostly

1297
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,160
by just saying okay

1298
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,920
point it at my edge device and do what

1299
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,560
you have to do

1300
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,880
um i think we answered the last question

1301
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,599
that was on here

1302
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,800
is there anybody else that has a

1303
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
question

1304
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,800
well you've run out i i'm sorry i think

1305
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,920
i talked a little too fast for you

1306
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,160
no i think that's uh you had a lot of

1307
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,359
material that you were trying to get in

1308
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:09,839
there

1309
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,280
i suspect that there are a number of

1310
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,359
people who are listening in who

1311
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,640
aren't as familiar with some of the

1312
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,680
concepts of software-defined networks

1313
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,800
uh and uh separation of planes in

1314
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,240
virtualization virtual networks uh

1315
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,560
to take full advantage of what you said

1316
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,359
but

1317
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,720
that's one of the benefits of having the

1318
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,800
recording they can go off and read up a

1319
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,000
little bit and come back and listen to

1320
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,760
it again i think there was a lot packed

1321
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,040
into your talk

1322
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,319
that is going to be of value to anybody

1323
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,400
who's working in this area

1324
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,839
and and just simply understanding the

1325
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,319
vision that one slide of what the future

1326
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,760
networks look like i

1327
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,960
i really resonated a lot with that so

1328
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
we have a lot of challenges ahead of us

1329
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,160
we

1330
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,280
we're not going to be out of work for

1331
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,200
anytime soon

1332
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,720
that's right uh all right and i see

1333
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,359
in the chat you've put your email

1334
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,040
address so if anyone

1335
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,319
has follow-up questions um you can

1336
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,599
reply there uh i haven't seen any other

1337
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,079
questions added so

1338
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,040
we will conclude with that and thank you

1339
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,160
so much

1340
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,440
for joining us today we actually look

1341
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
forward to you perhaps visiting us in

1342
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,400
person

1343
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,240
um on some future time when we're all

1344
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,520
uh vaccinated and uh able to host you

1345
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,839
i'd love to do that thanks everybody

1346
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,640
