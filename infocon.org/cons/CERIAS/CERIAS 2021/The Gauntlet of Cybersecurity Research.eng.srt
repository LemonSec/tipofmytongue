practice lee

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
welcome to purdue thank you very much

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
i'm very glad to

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
be here i'm going to talk today about

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,559
the gauntlet of cyber security research

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
in other words using security and cyber

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,559
security research

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,960
the goal of say when we say use excuse

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
me that he's not using security it's

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
using science and cyber security

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,280
research

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
the goal in using science and cyber

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
security research

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,799
is not to sit back and use the

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
scientific method that we all learned in

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,840
eighth grade

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
it is rather to do cyber security well

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
so this talk

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,840
is not designed at just researchers it's

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,320
aimed at

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
anyone in cyber security who wants to

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
figure things out

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,119
because that's the heart of cyber

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
security who did this

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
why did they do it how can i stop it

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
from happening again

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
what happens if i enact this policy what

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,119
happens if i block people from attacking

51
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,360
me on this port

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,439
everything in cyber security in its

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,360
heart is figuring these things

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,280
out so we all want to excuse me my

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,240
computer's not

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
is jumping we want to do a good job

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
figuring it out but we need a good

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
foundation for doing that

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,040
that's knowing what to do and knowing

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
what not to do

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
so to begin with we're going to collect

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
some data to do a study

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
we do this even if we're just handling

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
an incident right you have an incident

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
someone reports to you that something

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,160
happened

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
on this system so you have to go to that

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
system and collect some data

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
you do that in a measured fashion that

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,040
we call structured

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,879
observation in a structured observation

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,120
it's also common in science

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,200
that an ecologist for example is a nice

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
little science example is going to

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
measure the number of moths that show

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,599
open a drop

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
do they do this by just wandering

78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
through the fields and saying one moth

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,760
two moth three moths did they just throw

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,160
ma

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
traps all over the place and hope the

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
heck it works no

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
they figure out locations similar

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,879
locations with similar ecologies

85
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
like they always put in forest or they

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
always put it in swamps

87
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
they go measure at the same time every

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
day and they use the same kind of trap

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
and if there's any deviation from this

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
they note that down so that they know in

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,879
the future

92
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
hey this is why this might look a little

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
different

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,879
cyber security data should be collected

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,879
in a similar fashion

96
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,760
here's an example using network flow

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
network traffic

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
network traffic monitoring is different

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,159
if you put the sensor

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,239
outside the firewall or inside the

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,200
firewall

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
if you put it inside the firewall you

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
don't see all those attempts made to

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,920
connect to the part

105
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
that are blocked by the firewall but if

106
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
it's outside you do

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
and so if you're collecting network

108
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
traffic data and you have two sensors in

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
two different locations

110
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
you're not doing this in a structured

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
way you need to have them similarly set

112
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
up

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,239
so collecting data requires a plan you

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
have to have a plan of what you're doing

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,280
you just don't

116
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
for example when you're handling an

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
incident you just don't wander around

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
and go i think i'll look at random

119
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
systems and see what happened you know

120
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
you have a system of what you do a

121
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
checklist even

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
you also need to not affect the events

123
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,319
yourself

124
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
and the plan should be followed exactly

125
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
with no deviations

126
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
if for some reason you have to modify

127
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
the plan like hey the sensor that we

128
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
were using to collect network traffic

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
died for six hours on tuesday you need

130
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
to write that down so that you know in

131
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
the future what happened

132
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
and the plan should be usable by

133
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,280
everyone it's not the lee plan

134
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
it's not the joel plan it's the everyone

135
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,840
can use this

136
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,360
plan and once you have the data

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
you've done all your work you've

138
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
structured observation you've collected

139
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
the data

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
now you need to construct your study and

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
there's more than one kind of research

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,800
study available

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
so way back when i learned about the

144
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
scientific method we were essentially

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
told this is the only way to do it well

146
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
it's not exactly true

147
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
so in the following slides we'll go

148
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
through some different study types and

149
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,560
give some examples of what each one is

150
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,639
for example we start with natural

151
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
experiments and measurement studies

152
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
that's where you're observing the state

153
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
of the world

154
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
and some change happens for example when

155
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
gdpr rights were enacted

156
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
a major study was done by mog which is

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
the working group on

158
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
malware mobile and messaging to

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,880
determine

160
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,479
how did the gdpr rights and changed

161
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
how they were able to collect data

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
affecting these events

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
measuring cyber crime before and after a

164
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
law is enacted

165
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
similarly if you have a um

166
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
you're enacting a new policy you want to

167
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
know how does it change things with

168
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
enacting that new policy

169
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
you don't just say okay after the policy

170
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,919
this is what happened

171
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
you need to know what happened before

172
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
the policy in order to compare it to

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
what after the policy

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,199
to say hey these changes affected things

175
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
another one is a case study it's a

176
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
single report

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
like an hour you're studying a single

178
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,000
malware

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
you're studying a vulnerability a

180
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
variation of this

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is called a longitudinal case study

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
where you're staying changing

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,759
you're starting the malware over time

184
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
for example i have been studying

185
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,880
uh malicious word documents over time

186
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
how did they change from my first set of

187
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,000
data

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
from four years ago to what's happening

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,759
now with these

190
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,280
are they all still using the same

191
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
methods have they changed how they're

192
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,919
doing it

193
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,680
and i'm putting together a report that

194
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
tells you that

195
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
people be malicious and things aren't

196
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
changing that much

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
another one is an intervention and this

198
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
is commonly happening in incident

199
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,319
response

200
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
so i've been to the victim of a ddos

201
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,520
i've been a victim of a dos

202
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,120
i've been woken up at two in the morning

203
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
because i was in industry

204
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
because one of our customers got hit

205
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
with the dental of service they wanted

206
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
me to do something about it

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
so i did an intervention i blocked the

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
ip address it was coming from

209
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
luckily at the time this was before ddos

210
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
was a major thing and i could do that

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
but i also was able to say hey after i

212
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
booted the intervention the dos stopped

213
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
and i can go back to sleep now when

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
that's a good thing

215
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
clifford stohl's book the cuckoo zag is

216
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,479
a prime example of an intervention study

217
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
a randomized control trial is what we

218
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
often see

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,479
in medicine we have a group of people we

220
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
want to try a new vaccine on so we don't

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,479
try it on everyone we try it on a

222
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
subset and then we have a control group

223
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
that we don't try it on

224
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
this was seen in a lot of the covid

225
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
studies for these new vaccines

226
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,440
this also happens in cyber security this

227
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
happens when we canary software releases

228
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
so if we have a whole bunch of systems

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,639
and we need to update software we might

230
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
do it on a control set excuse me a set

231
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,759
of those

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
we leave a control set as everyone else

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
to see help a change affected

234
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,000
some user studies in cyber security also

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
do the same thing

236
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,319
and finally one that's near and dear to

237
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
my heart is mathematical exploration

238
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
rather than you know releasing the piece

239
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
of malware on the world and seeing what

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,400
would happen

241
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
because you know that's very bad to do

242
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,240
we instead

243
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
create a model of how this could happen

244
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
and look at what happens

245
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,960
this was done and to watch and see how

246
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
worms

247
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
spread and also it's all fuzzing fuzzing

248
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
is a simulation or a mathematical

249
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
exploration

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,199
and zert has done fuzzing so

251
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
now that we know what the five types are

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
in general let's talk about the results

253
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,159
the results are important

254
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,640
but what's also important is how these

255
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
results can be used by other people

256
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
so there's reproducibility right

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
clickability and they're two completely

258
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
different things they also have a friend

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
named corroboration

260
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
but reproducibility and replicability

261
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
also often get tossed together and

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
people to understand there's an actual

263
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
difference in what you do with the

264
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
results

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
reproducible means i can take data from

266
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,480
the study and compute the same outcomes

267
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
replicability means i can take the

268
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
method

269
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
so reproducible is the data and

270
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
replicable

271
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
is the method to get the same

272
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
cooperation conclusions

273
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
corroboration means someone else did a

274
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,600
different study and got the same results

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
for example several years ago actually

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
a lot of years ago a co-worker and i

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
released a 300-page report on blacklists

278
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
yes 300 pages on how they didn't

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,880
actually always agree

280
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
that blacklists were looking at

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
different things or even if they were

282
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
looking at the same things where they

283
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
were catching different things

284
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
i was told that a person went to a

285
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
conference with a presentation that

286
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
began with

287
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
i looked at their report i decided they

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
were completely and absolutely wrong so

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
i was going to redo it with my own data

290
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,160
and methods

291
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,800
and see what i got his end result was

292
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,440
you know what they were right

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
blacklists don't agree

294
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
we want our research to be used right i

295
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
wanted the fact that i found black lists

296
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
to be

297
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
disjoint to be used and i wanted to be

298
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,720
applicable

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
but you know if my research can't be

300
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,680
repeated or reproduced or corroborated

301
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
it is less useful doesn't mean it's not

302
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
useful at all it just means that people

303
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
can't replicate what i was doing

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
now i run into malware researchers who

305
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
inform me

306
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
that if you look at any other type of

307
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,600
malware than the one they're using

308
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
then of course i can't be repeating it

309
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
or reproducing it which is probably true

310
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
but if i'm looking at the same kind of

311
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
malware i should be able to

312
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,200
so far i've considered done the goals of

313
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
research the kind of study

314
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,079
how to collect data what about the

315
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
results

316
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
these are important things but also

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,839
important are pitfalls

318
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
what can you do to keep your research

319
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
useful and applicable

320
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,160
i this isn't everything that's actually

321
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,839
covered in my second book in a more

322
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
depth and hopefully my third book

323
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
but i hope it's a good introduction on

324
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
what you need to avoid when doing

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
cyber security research

326
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
i'm going to start with visualizations

327
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,279
now i'm quoting a coworker of mine who

328
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
told me she was a statistician

329
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
that a visualization is a model for the

330
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
eyes

331
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
you know we can generate these in huge

332
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
machine learning models and everything

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
or we can just make a picture and let

334
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
the eyes go hey there's the anomaly

335
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,240
right there in that corner

336
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
that shouldn't be there it's letting my

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
brain be the analytic engine rather than

338
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
writing a huge machine learning thing

339
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,240
a bad visualization though can hinder

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
this it can

341
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,639
obfuscate the story it can hide trends

342
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,120
it can highlight the wrong thing it can

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
be hard to understand

344
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
so when you start with a visualization i

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
mean and there are entire books written

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,839
on this topic these are just things that

347
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
i think are important

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
you need to start by considering why am

349
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
i making this picture

350
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
remember a picture is worth a thousand

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,720
words

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
okay it tells a story what story am i

353
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,959
trying to tell

354
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,040
what do i want the people looking at it

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
to take away from it

356
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
is the visualization necessary we

357
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,560
get papers into d trap where quite often

358
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
we go back to the authors and say

359
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
why did you add these visualizations

360
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
they're not telling me anything

361
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
we want to help you tell the story we

362
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
don't want you to distract from the

363
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
story

364
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
am i trying to show something as

365
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
actionable do i want them to look at the

366
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
picture and go

367
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,639
ah there's the anomaly i should do

368
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
something with that anomaly and go off

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
and do something

370
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
or am i just trying to illustrate to

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
explain a point

372
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
so here's my first picture this is this

373
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
picture is important to me because i

374
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
have seen an animated version of this

375
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,639
picture

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,000
and i still don't know what i was

377
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
supposed to take away from the animated

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
version of the picture

379
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
so first of all is this a static point

380
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,959
in time is it a snapshot of that

381
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
animated picture okay in that case

382
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
that's kind of interesting

383
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
or is it over the last hour of the

384
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,600
animation

385
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,560
is it cumulative for a day that doesn't

386
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,839
really tell me anything in the

387
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,639
highlights

388
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
but i'm going to assume it's cumulative

389
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
for say an hour or so

390
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
and it tells the viewer ip address is

391
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,760
talk to ports

392
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
it's very important it also tells me

393
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,079
that it looks like there was some

394
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
scanning possibly going on

395
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
there was one ip address that looked

396
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,760
like it got completely scanned from top

397
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
to bottom and then there's one that

398
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
got scanned from ports 32 000 and up

399
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
herself

400
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,160
but does it tell me anything i can go

401
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
off and do with it

402
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
well it's a pretty picture i'll give it

403
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
that it's a nice purple color

404
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,760
if the point of my picture is ip

405
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,240
addresses talk to ports during the day

406
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
or during the hour or there's some

407
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
scanning that happens

408
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
i guess what this is a decent picture

409
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
this is a good visualization i could

410
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
take that away from it

411
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,079
but if the point of this is here is

412
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,040
actionable data

413
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,959
this isn't a good visualization for one

414
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,560
thing i have no idea what ip addresses

415
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
i'm supposed to care about

416
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
there sometimes to care about i'm sure

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
but what if you know one of those is a

418
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,839
web server that's suddenly talking on

419
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,680
things that shouldn't be talking on

420
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
how do i know that it's lost in that

421
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,240
noise

422
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
and i also like to point this picture

423
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,600
out and say okay

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
if someone says find the anomalies

425
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
here's a lovely picture find the

426
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,720
anomalies because like i said

427
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
originally visualizations can be using

428
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,639
your eyes for the model

429
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,639
and your eyes can say here's the

430
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
anomalies in this picture so when i say

431
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
here are the anomalies what would you

432
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
say

433
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
well you'd say there's some scanning

434
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
then that's all i got

435
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
if someone else has anything else they

436
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
can tell me that's there

437
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
that's great but i don't see anything

438
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
other than here's a lovely picture of

439
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,839
ips and ports talking each other

440
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,760
i've also made a visualization of ports

441
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,079
talking to ports

442
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,359
it doesn't tell me anything either

443
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
and if the point of this visualization

444
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
is hey there's some scanning then adding

445
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
some color can help

446
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,959
that does highlight there's some

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
scanning but it also doesn't tell me

448
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
there's anything actionable i'm telling

449
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
the story

450
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
that they're scanning but i'm not giving

451
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
anything actionable there's nothing

452
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
really actionable in this picture

453
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
now on the other hand if i made a

454
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
completely new visualization

455
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,560
and like i did in this picture and i

456
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,680
threw in some ip addresses

457
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,759
then hey guess what this is potentially

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,880
actionable

459
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,759
that ip address 127.10.163.113

460
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,160
sucker's being scanned or was scanned

461
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,560
127.10.231.15 was scanned from ports 32

462
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
000 and up

463
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,680
that's also something i should know so

464
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
this additional information of the ip

465
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
addresses makes this a little more

466
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,320
actionable

467
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
but if there wasn't any scanning then

468
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
it'd also be a nice pretty picture

469
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
with some nice purple and red which is

470
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
not exactly great visualization but

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
there's some colors always be careful

472
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
with your colors

473
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
here's my next example and this one is

474
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
also to make a separate point

475
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
so a gadget in software is an entry

476
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
point that can potentially be exploited

477
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
doesn't mean it can be exploited it just

478
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,519
means it can potentially be exploited

479
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,560
now not every gadget can be exploited

480
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
at all and so by me counting these when

481
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
i'm saying that all the gadgets are

482
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
actually equal

483
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,759
they're all the same i equate this to

484
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,800
saying okay

485
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
all the holes in a damp are the exactly

486
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,000
the same way

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
that little tiny drop of hole in the

488
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
corner is the same weight

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,280
as the giant gaping hole in the center

490
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
not really no but this is a common

491
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,240
problem when doing frequencies

492
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
because when you count like this you're

493
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
making everything in the set

494
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
equal weight you're saying everything is

495
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the same i have ten gadgets

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,839
therefore it implies that there's ten

497
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
similarity similar things going on

498
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,679
there are in the fact that they are all

499
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
gadgets they are not and they don't have

500
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
the same meaning

501
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,160
if we count and visualize the number of

502
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,640
vulnerabilities

503
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
the same thing happens we're giving

504
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
every vulnerability of the same meaning

505
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
now it depends on what story you're

506
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
trying to tell

507
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
if you're trying to say the linux kernel

508
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
has 200 vulnerabilities off

509
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,760
as of today and this year

510
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
and i don't know that's true or not i

511
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
just made that up then that's one thing

512
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,360
to say if you're saying all 200

513
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
vulnerabilities are the equal

514
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,919
exploitable and equally scary

515
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
that's not the same thing

516
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
so i redid the visualization i said

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
okay software zero has all these

518
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,480
gadgets but none of them are exploitable

519
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
software one has some

520
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,360
that are exploitable so

521
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,400
i made a histogram and i have changed

522
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
the story a little bit now of course

523
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
doesn't mean when i say they're

524
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
exploitable this doesn't mean they're

525
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,160
equally

526
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
easy to exploit that means that someone

527
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
could exploit them potentially

528
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
one of them may take a month of coding

529
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
one of them may take two minutes

530
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
depending on your ability to code

531
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
it's still saying the same weight but

532
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,559
i'm also explaining to people that not

533
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,640
every gadget can be exploited

534
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
so this is the story i'm trying to tell

535
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
the message i'm trying to give with this

536
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
visualization and the second point is

537
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,600
hey not every software gadget is

538
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
exploitable some are

539
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
some aren't some software has gadgets

540
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,760
but none of them are exploitable

541
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
always think of your audience when

542
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
you're making a visualization

543
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
if you're writing a paper if you're

544
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
putting together a

545
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,640
powerpoint what story are you trying to

546
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
tell

547
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
are you trying it's too easy to make a

548
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
visualization that will obfuscate the

549
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
point you're trying to make

550
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
this isn't also one that's near and dear

551
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
to my heart because i'm looking at

552
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,760
malicious domains i have a set of

553
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
malicious domains

554
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
i believe i collected this one from the

555
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
malware domain list

556
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
and i just went through and got the

557
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
first letter of every full

558
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,799
fully qualified domain name and i

559
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,440
plotted it

560
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,480
as a histogram that's sort of like going

561
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,679
into the dictionary picking a whole

562
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
bunch of random words and doing the same

563
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,480
thing

564
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
that's nothing that's unique to domains

565
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
that's just an interesting little

566
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,400
feature

567
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,520
that happens in the alphabet and i could

568
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,039
do it with any set of words and i

569
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,480
wouldn't really be telling you anything

570
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
about domains at all would i

571
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
just that hey they all start with this

572
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,799
and fully qualified domain names

573
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,520
often start with a w and which kind of

574
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
makes sense because www

575
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,360
dot whatever but so what

576
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,400
i got nothing it's a pretty thing but

577
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
this is a feature of domains they have a

578
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,760
tld

579
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
and i can go through and look at the

580
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,840
most common tld

581
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
and this is potentially interesting

582
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
because tld is a common feature

583
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,640
two domains that i could potentially use

584
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
now the fact that most of these domains

585
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,919
were in com

586
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
isn't that necessarily interesting

587
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,400
because com is actually the largest tld

588
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
of all i haven't counted the number of

589
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
domains in there in a while but it's

590
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
pretty big on the other hand name is in

591
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,840
there

592
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
name is the second highest and name is

593
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
actually kind of small

594
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,480
and it also is interesting is how many

595
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,760
are showing up in brand new tlds

596
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
that's a you can actually get the brand

597
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,799
new dlds

598
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,440
um fully domain zone files that's

599
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
actually part of

600
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
them registering it is i can look at

601
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
them and say hey how many of these are

602
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,679
malicious

603
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
i did a study with a and we found that

604
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
in for example the

605
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
tv which is the country code for tuvalu

606
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,679
i believe with the exception of a few

607
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,280
tv stations there's a whole lot of

608
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
maliciousness in there

609
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
so now that i've gone through my pet

610
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
peeve on visualizations

611
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,559
i'm going to do an example of research

612
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,120
i firmly believe you can learn as much

613
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,679
from

614
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,799
good examples and bad examples so i've

615
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,440
put together essentially a bad example

616
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,159
of research i want you to remember that

617
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
this is a bad example and don't do these

618
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,640
things

619
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
i also made this up i completely made

620
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,640
this up i didn't do any research at all

621
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
it's all made up i just want to

622
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
reiterate i made this up

623
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
so i'm starting with a theory and i

624
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,640
often start with kind of theories like

625
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
this i may have just looked at some data

626
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
and said hey wait a minute this ip has

627
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
been bad over the sex

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
past six months and every month it gets

629
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,600
more and more malicious domains pointed

630
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,480
to it

631
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
huh i wonder why and then i say hey

632
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,000
i wonder if that's true for all the

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
malicious domain i.p addresses excuse me

634
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
are they gradually is longer that they

635
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
stay malicious

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
the bad guys use it more more often is

637
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,400
that true

638
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
well i think it's true and i'm going to

639
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
prove it's true

640
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,600
so what do i need i need an ip list

641
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
a list of malicious ip addresses i tend

642
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
to collect this kind of stuff

643
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,520
and so i have a set i've met any sets i

644
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
need passive dns so

645
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
let me look up what domains point to

646
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,039
those ip addresses

647
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,240
and i need a collection schedule

648
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
is there anything else i need i mean i

649
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
need the standard computers in order to

650
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
collect all this data

651
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
but this is basically the kind of data i

652
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,360
need to make this thing happen

653
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
so i'm going to collect the data on the

654
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,679
first of every month for the previous

655
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,400
month

656
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
so what i used to do is collect passive

657
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,480
dns for a month

658
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,159
and then go through and look at it after

659
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,000
that month so during

660
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,960
that month i might see for this ip

661
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
address

662
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,640
on the first of the month it had five

663
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,799
domains and then it added more and more

664
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
domains to the end of the month then at

665
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,520
the end of the month there were some

666
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,960
total of 20

667
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
domains that pointed to the ip address

668
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
during the month

669
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
so i count that i'm not interested in

670
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
pointer lookups

671
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
because pointer lookups really require

672
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,679
ownership of the ip address to work

673
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,200
bad guys don't always own their ip

674
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,080
addresses so i'm looking at a records

675
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
because anyone can make an a record to

676
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,640
point to anywhere

677
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,080
so i'm starting with some basic counting

678
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,799
some basic exploratory data analysis and

679
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
i make a picture so i can look at it

680
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
and i average the number of domains for

681
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,120
ip address and created the histogram

682
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
it's just a basic histogram

683
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,919
hey all month one almost six ips

684
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
excuse me almost six domains per ip and

685
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
by the end

686
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,200
about 12. okay but

687
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
i noticed something i'm interested in

688
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,159
how the data changes from month to month

689
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
month one and month two of the same

690
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
average that really isn't helping my

691
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,320
case

692
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
i'm saying things change and the fact

693
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,360
that they did

694
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,679
doesn't help me anything so i'm just

695
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,600
going to drop month one because of that

696
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
i am not going to do my study on three

697
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,159
months instead of four

698
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,840
and then i look at the distribution for

699
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,279
month two in general

700
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,640
just plot out how many domains

701
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,559
point to each ipa address do some

702
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,080
counting and i have a nice pretty

703
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,440
picture

704
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
so i really am interested in ip

705
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,360
addresses

706
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,279
that have domains not those without

707
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
domains those without domains are not

708
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,080
adding anything to my story my story is

709
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,679
that i p addresses have domains

710
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,520
so i see a lot of those in that for that

711
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,799
month

712
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
and i'm just going to drop them for my

713
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,080
study i mean they're not adding anything

714
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,880
to my study

715
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,080
there's 140 some odd just drop them

716
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,400
not have anything to do with it and i

717
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
redo everything

718
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,400
right look at this i have a nice pretty

719
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,360
picture

720
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,159
and i have a story it shows that it does

721
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:16,799
increase

722
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,279
month two now has an average over six

723
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,480
almost seven

724
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,679
month three is about ten months as

725
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,080
four is about twelve i've made a nice

726
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,880
pretty picture

727
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
i show an increase i'm done my research

728
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,279
is correct

729
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,000
everything happy enjoying all that

730
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,960
except i made so many mistakes in this

731
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
and remember i said i like bad examples

732
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,799
and i was going to make mistakes so i

733
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,120
made so many in this

734
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,080
let's look at what i did wrong avoiding

735
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,840
these mistakes is important in doing

736
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
cyber security well and it's not just

737
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
cyber security this is actually a common

738
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,840
problem and a lot of research but this

739
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
is a cyber security example so we'll

740
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
stick with that

741
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,200
first thing i relied only on the average

742
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,320
to decide that i should drop month one

743
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,720
out

744
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
i said hey the averages are the same i'm

745
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,080
done

746
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,919
i've said the average tells me

747
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,240
everything i need to know

748
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
about these distributions

749
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
the histogram shows they're very very

750
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
different distributions

751
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,600
to be precise if you really were curious

752
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,919
i derived one from a skewed normal and

753
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,360
another one from the poisson

754
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,559
distribution

755
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
they're very very different

756
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,480
distributions once i plotted it out

757
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
and by saying hey that mean sells me

758
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,720
everything i need to know

759
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
i'm missing a lot i mean look at this

760
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,480
histogram

761
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,440
um in month two i get a lot of things

762
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,840
that

763
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,880
have zero but in month one it's only

764
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
almost over 50. but in month one

765
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,840
you know the most common is five

766
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,799
don't rely on single summary statistics

767
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,520
a single

768
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,240
a summary statistic is mean median mode

769
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
or standard deviation

770
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
you shouldn't rely on just one number to

771
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
describe an entire distribution

772
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
they can be misleading that way so let's

773
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
go back to this i put in the mean median

774
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,399
and mode and standard deviation for both

775
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,279
in this

776
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,159
and if you see the mean and the median

777
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,520
are the exactly the same

778
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,720
for both months i constructed it so the

779
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
mean was the same

780
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
the median being the same just happened

781
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
as a happy accident

782
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,159
the mode though is completely different

783
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,919
mode is the most common

784
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
so the most common for month two was

785
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,919
zero the most common for month one was

786
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,880
five

787
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
that's a completely different thing

788
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
telling me the standard deviation or the

789
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
spread around the mean is also different

790
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,080
in each one

791
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
they're completely different

792
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
distributions

793
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,640
mistake number two i didn't stick with

794
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
my plan

795
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,120
you should always stick with your plan i

796
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,919
said hey

797
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
okay i looked at the data and this

798
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
didn't work so i'm just going to drop

799
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,200
things and change my plan completely

800
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,799
always stay with your plan if the plan

801
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,520
doesn't work

802
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,360
that's another problem we'll discuss

803
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,720
later but

804
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
never ever change your plan in the

805
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
middle

806
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
i said in my plan i was going to

807
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,480
conserve a data from each month

808
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
not that i was going to pick the months

809
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
that worked the best

810
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
i should have stuck with the four months

811
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
and knowing that

812
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
i may or may not have proven when i was

813
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
after is a different thing

814
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,039
but i should have stuck with my plan

815
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,320
mistake number three i just dropped some

816
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440
data

817
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,399
i said you know i don't like this data i

818
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:44,640
have

819
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
with these ip addresses i'm just going

820
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,480
to drop it and it's going to be just

821
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
fine and wi-fi data

822
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,679
never ever omit data from the study

823
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,640
unless there's a very good reason

824
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
for example if for month one it had been

825
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
really corrupted or i'd lost my passive

826
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,559
dns data feed or i lost my drive

827
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,039
completely which i had done in the past

828
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,240
that's a good reason

829
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
to drop the data but i have to document

830
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,600
why i dropped the data and didn't follow

831
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
the plan

832
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
so i would document from month one oops

833
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
i lost the hard drive

834
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,919
and i was not able to collect things for

835
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,240
three weeks so i was unable to use month

836
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,760
one

837
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,440
i didn't just drop the data because i

838
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,600
don't like the data

839
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,559
other pitfalls

840
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,760
this is an example of going back to the

841
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
visualization on domain names

842
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
use subject matter and knowledge to

843
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,799
inform data aggregation

844
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,279
the visualization using tlds is a very

845
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,679
good example of this use tlds to group

846
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
things not alphabetical

847
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,240
for vulnerabilities we don't group

848
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,720
vulnerabilities by um

849
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,760
the first letter of the description of

850
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,200
the vulnerability which would be very

851
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
weird because i think most of them start

852
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,080
with t

853
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,799
but we grope them in ways that make

854
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,080
sense for the fact that they are

855
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,520
vulnerabilities

856
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,360
for malware we tend to group them in

857
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
families because that makes sense for

858
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,919
the malware

859
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,080
we don't just pick random features and

860
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
say we'll group them by this

861
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,840
we used our subject matter knowledge

862
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,039
another example pitfall is to validate

863
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,000
results

864
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,240
i should have had a second set of data

865
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,039
to go back

866
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,600
and see if i can get the same results

867
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,120
these mistakes are called data dredging

868
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
they have many other forms of being

869
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,039
called i like data dredging

870
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,799
occasionally it's called p hacking it is

871
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
thought to be why not our research is

872
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,080
replicable okay

873
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
people are going back and changing their

874
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
plan they're dropping data

875
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,000
and then you go back and try to

876
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,720
replicate the results

877
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,760
or corroborate and you can't because in

878
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,080
the middle they changed horses midstream

879
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,519
and you should never change horses

880
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,880
midstream

881
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,159
you should keep with the plan and i made

882
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,640
one

883
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
very major mistake i kept saying

884
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,440
um this doesn't fit my theory so i'm

885
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
changing the situation

886
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,039
i kept saying you know uh the fact that

887
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
things aren't changing from month one to

888
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,519
month two

889
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,120
does not help my theory so i'm just

890
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
gonna drop month one

891
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,519
the fact those ip addresses didn't fit

892
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
don't fit my situation so i'm just gonna

893
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,640
drop vip addresses

894
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,279
i was married to that idea i was married

895
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
to the idea that there was something

896
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,360
there

897
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,200
and i was cherry-picking the data to

898
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
prove the result i had already decided

899
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
was true

900
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
this happens in more than cyber security

901
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,720
it's a very big problem in math as well

902
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,760
never ever marry your ideas okay

903
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,519
you can be wrong and being wrong is okay

904
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,039
the important thing is to know when

905
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,880
you're wrong the important thing is to

906
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
say okay

907
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,600
if i had gone through the study

908
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
originally and said okay this doesn't

909
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,919
actually work there isn't a change over

910
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
all the whole thing over the four months

911
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,399
that is a result to know

912
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
for example that blacklist study i

913
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
mentioned earlier

914
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,440
when we started it everyone had the

915
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,399
assumption that blacklist always agreed

916
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
there may be little bits here and there

917
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
that they didn't agree on but for the

918
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,279
most part that they agreed

919
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,880
and we came along and said um nope

920
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
they don't and if you look at the 300

921
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
pages and it's mostly tables there's

922
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,240
about 12 pages of actual writing

923
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,399
and the rest of its tables we slice and

924
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,480
dice that data every way we possibly

925
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,279
could

926
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,960
to see if we could prove the result that

927
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
there was some agreement somewhere

928
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,679
with the blacklist

929
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,039
and you know what there was nothing

930
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,200
there but so never

931
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
ever marry your ideas it's okay to be

932
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,799
wrong

933
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,279
it happens it should happen in research

934
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,440
it's not always being right

935
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,279
which gonna take me to my next point

936
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,360
which is negative results

937
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,480
are still results okay

938
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
this is a very big important topic to me

939
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,399
because

940
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,760
first of all you hear the phrase

941
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,919
negative results and you hear the word

942
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,720
negative and people are like oh wait

943
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,000
negative

944
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,840
negative is bad okay so

945
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
they shouldn't be reported because the

946
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
word negative their mistake

947
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,760
i don't care about negative results

948
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
negative results are not mistakes

949
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
mistakes are what i made in that example

950
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,399
i went through and the bad example i

951
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,320
made misremember i made mistake after

952
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,200
mistake

953
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,840
i used aggregate statistics and i relied

954
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,279
on them i dropped data

955
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,480
i changed plans in midstream that is

956
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
called a null result

957
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
you know result is when you make the

958
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,760
mistakes in your study

959
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,679
a negative result is when you do

960
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,039
everything right

961
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
and my result does not prove my

962
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
hypothesis okay

963
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
two different things remember that null

964
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,120
results are the bad ones

965
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,879
negative results are actually good

966
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
things to know for example

967
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,119
in covid if someone had come up with a

968
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,119
vaccine and tried it out and said hey

969
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
wait this doesn't work

970
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,119
knowing that actually saves time and

971
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,800
money for other people

972
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
they don't try to replicate your

973
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,879
reaction

974
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,040
negative results are important

975
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,079
so research is kind of like a maze okay

976
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
you start at the upper corner with a

977
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
theory and you try to get the bottom

978
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
right with the result and you're going

979
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,320
through the maze

980
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
and you well everyone wants it to be a

981
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,719
nice pretty linear start stop

982
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,520
nice straight line research is rarely if

983
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
ever a straight line

984
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,639
there's never a start stop okay a to b

985
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,918
research is winding your way through the

986
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:54,960
maze

987
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,079
and it's more about the path you took

988
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,880
as the paths you didn't take why don't

989
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
those corner cases

990
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
work what are the assumptions being made

991
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
in those corner cases

992
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,480
that don't apply to the real world what

993
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,280
can we learn

994
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
from this okay it's always about what

995
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,000
can we learn

996
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
so when do you report negative results

997
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,560
the same time you report positive

998
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
results negative results should not be

999
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
ignored because of the word negative

1000
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,079
results

1001
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,680
negative results should be paid

1002
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,320
attention to always

1003
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,839
is the result useful

1004
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
does the result remove this field of

1005
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,800
cyber security forward in some way

1006
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,520
is it novel is it a new thing to be

1007
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,800
known

1008
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,640
was the research done well which is

1009
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,000
always important but either it's

1010
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,760
positive result or negative result

1011
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
was the research done well if the

1012
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
research was not done well then

1013
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,839
well it shouldn't be reported either way

1014
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,760
does it challenge a commonly held

1015
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
assumption this is important to me

1016
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
in negative results because people have

1017
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,359
their assumptions

1018
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
about how the world works how cyber

1019
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,400
security works

1020
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,160
they have the assumption on how black

1021
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,079
lists work people believe

1022
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,839
that it didn't matter what black list

1023
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,760
they chose to determine if their domains

1024
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,079
were

1025
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,960
wrong if they chose a random blacklist

1026
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
what my coworker and i

1027
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,359
said at the end was no you're not

1028
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
finding new things what you just did

1029
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
is replicate that blacklist by proving

1030
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
your domains are bad

1031
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,200
you have to know the commonly held

1032
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,800
assumptions everyone has and you should

1033
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
challenge them in some fashion to say

1034
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,359
hey

1035
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,480
is this true is this not true in math

1036
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
we always start with an assumption but

1037
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,359
we can always back up our assumption

1038
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,040
the same thing should be true in cyber

1039
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
security

1040
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,839
cyber security is also nev it's never

1041
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,800
static

1042
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
it is always changing when i got in this

1043
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,480
field

1044
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,520
year 30 years ago floppies existed right

1045
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,240
my very very first virus i ever had to

1046
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,960
deal with

1047
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,880
i got on a five and a quarter inch

1048
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,200
floppy and i got it from the language

1049
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
lab

1050
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
at auburn university and i took it back

1051
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
to the language lab and said there's a

1052
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,400
virus on this

1053
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
and they were very very confused about

1054
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,760
what i was talking about as i handed it

1055
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
back to them

1056
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,320
i said don't give this out to anyone

1057
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,760
else get rid of it

1058
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,839
and i think they gave that out to other

1059
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
people anyway because they didn't

1060
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,800
know what i was talking about so it is

1061
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
always always changing thing

1062
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,000
i dealt with a security incident that

1063
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,359
actually came about because

1064
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,079
someone didn't secure wireless in this

1065
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
day and age the idea of someone not

1066
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,599
securing wireless is just you know it's

1067
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,320
not done

1068
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,520
everyone secures the wireless so it's

1069
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,079
always

1070
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,079
changing from the beginning to end it's

1071
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,920
never been the same

1072
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,800
i mean the original ransomware would no

1073
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,160
yeah the original ransomware came

1074
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
out in floppies okay it didn't really

1075
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,000
work because

1076
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,440
floppies for example when i got into

1077
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,400
this business

1078
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,079
and when i first worked for a startup

1079
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,440
isp domain parking was his thing

1080
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
and it means something different back

1081
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
then than it does now back then

1082
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
you took a domain and you parked it on

1083
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
an iap address and the reason you did

1084
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,960
that

1085
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,119
is because it took a long time from when

1086
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
the time you registered a domain

1087
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,000
until it was active it these days you'll

1088
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
register them

1089
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
i registered the main for my niece and

1090
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,720
10 minutes later it was live

1091
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
today 30 years ago it took a lot longer

1092
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,720
for one thing the

1093
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,040
internet was not exactly as big of pipes

1094
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,680
shooting data around as you see today

1095
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,680
so domain parking meant something

1096
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,000
back then and back then bad guys used it

1097
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,119
a lot

1098
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,200
in the old days it was used by malicious

1099
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,320
actors

1100
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
it wasn't just people doing it anyone

1101
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
malicious actors did it quite often

1102
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,440
because they'd register a whole bunch of

1103
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,640
domains

1104
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
all at once they'd park them and then

1105
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,240
they used them as they needed them

1106
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
so my co-worker and i showed that

1107
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
currently domain parking

1108
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
is not a thing when the addresses are a

1109
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,040
part of it they're parking you know

1110
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,280
private ip addresses

1111
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,839
i looked at and this was a brute force

1112
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,240
no spiffy machine learning no spiffy

1113
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
method at all i brute forced this and

1114
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,280
looked at

1115
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,800
300 million domains and the end result

1116
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,599
was about

1117
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,040
500 or so of those domains that used the

1118
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,160
private id's

1119
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,400
parking weren't considered malicious

1120
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,280
domains

1121
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,599
i mean that's not even a drop in the

1122
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,560
bucket

1123
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,599
i mean there's just

1124
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,839
so many domains out there okay and if

1125
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,839
you randomly chose a domain using any

1126
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,680
kind of method that said hey

1127
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
i'm going to find malicious domains that

1128
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
park in a pi vip addresses using my

1129
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,560
sweetly spiffy method is 99

1130
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,920
effective what we said at the end was

1131
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,440
yeah you're more likely to be wrong than

1132
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,520
right it's called the base rate fallacy

1133
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,680
it was just the smallest base rate of

1134
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,720
that stuff happening

1135
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
the fact that we did this upset many

1136
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,280
people and it was hard to publish

1137
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,359
because they expected otherwise and our

1138
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,599
proof that their assumption was wrong

1139
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,079
bothered them what we were saying was

1140
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,520
hey you know that machine learning

1141
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,000
method you're

1142
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,680
doing to do find this don't

1143
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760
find something else to look at use it

1144
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
for something else but don't do it for

1145
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:17,920
this

1146
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
because there's just nothing there to

1147
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
find

1148
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,440
and it shouldn't have bothered them it

1149
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,200
should not have bothered them at all

1150
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
science is everything science is

1151
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,480
positive results

1152
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
science is negative results science says

1153
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
everything not just the results

1154
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,160
you happen to like

1155
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,839
cyber security well should always be

1156
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,839
your goal okay you should collect your

1157
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,960
data well

1158
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
you should use structured observation to

1159
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,079
collect your data

1160
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,000
you shouldn't be affecting your data as

1161
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,520
you collect it you just imagine it

1162
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
dropping it into a bucket

1163
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,240
i have buckets and buckets of data okay

1164
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
i have under 20 terabytes of data and

1165
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
have space in my office i have some big

1166
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,440
buckets in my office

1167
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,000
i like to collect data but i try not to

1168
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
affect the collection

1169
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,640
and then once i use it and i try to come

1170
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
up with things to show of that data

1171
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,359
i want my results to be replicable and i

1172
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,119
want them to be repeatable and i want

1173
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,800
people to be able to corroborate them

1174
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,640
avoiding those pitfalls though that i

1175
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
mentioned and there's a lot of pitfalls

1176
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
there's a lot more than

1177
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,200
that bad example um there's a lot of

1178
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,480
fallacies

1179
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,880
you see people who believe that since i

1180
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,359
found an anomaly in cybersecurity

1181
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,119
data therefore i found something

1182
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
malicious

1183
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
that's not true that's a fallacy right

1184
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,440
there

1185
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
the base rape fallacy i mentioned

1186
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,640
earlier that's another one that should

1187
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,760
be avoided

1188
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
so avoid the pitfalls in your research

1189
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,839
and you want your results to be relevant

1190
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,520
and useful

1191
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,359
i want people to use that blacklist

1192
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
result i want people to say hey

1193
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
blacklists don't agree so if i'm finding

1194
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,240
bad things

1195
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,839
and i only use one block list to

1196
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,440
corroborate myself

1197
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,760
i'm missing things and i'm not seeing

1198
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,240
everything

1199
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
and the other thing that happens in the

1200
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,640
data dredging is what people

1201
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,599
data is weird okay when you collect data

1202
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,960
data can be very weird

1203
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,119
and every person has a different view on

1204
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,079
the internet

1205
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,839
so what i collect and the way i'm

1206
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,520
collecting things may be different from

1207
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,359
the way you collect for example routing

1208
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,560
data

1209
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
because the in there's no global

1210
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,000
snapshot of what the internet routing

1211
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,920
table looks like everyone has their own

1212
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,880
view

1213
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,160
of what's going on so

1214
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,200
if i hand you my method and you're

1215
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
collecting for example routing data

1216
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
you should be able to have it applied to

1217
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,040
your routing data so i shouldn't be

1218
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,680
doing my research in such a way that i

1219
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
am finding those little corner cases and

1220
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,640
weirdnesses in my data

1221
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,560
always try to keep it as generic as

1222
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
possible and avoid data dredging or also

1223
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,680
known as p

1224
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
hacking and all the phrases that's been

1225
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,040
called

1226
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,280
and if you can validation is important

1227
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,119
you want your results to be used by

1228
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,160
others we want people to actually say

1229
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,359
hey lee found this blacklist result it's

1230
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,000
important

1231
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,160
it's been corroborated we can use it

1232
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,720
and thank you very much and i have

1233
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,160
questions do we have any questions

1234
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,759
uh ask questions in the chart

1235
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,200
thank you lee uh yes there are some

1236
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,599
questions in the chat

1237
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,760
are you able to get them or i see one

1238
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,319
does replicable you acquire reproducible

1239
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,920
and i usually think of them almost two

1240
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,640
different things

1241
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,040
i don't think one worker necessarily

1242
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,920
requires the other

1243
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,319
um and no i have never changed a single

1244
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,480
side floppy to a double-sided one with a

1245
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,180
paper hole punch

1246
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,160
[Laughter]

1247
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,480
i actually just recently found a nice

1248
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,000
box of five and a quarter

1249
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,839
five and a half inch floppies and tossed

1250
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,160
them i also found a five and a half inch

1251
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
floppy drive in my pile of hardware and

1252
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,160
got rid of that too i had no idea why i

1253
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,640
still had that

1254
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
so if audience members have any

1255
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
questions please post them in the q

1256
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
a section the chat is fine as well but

1257
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,000
the q a

1258
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,839
and that gives us an easier opportunity

1259
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:37,839
to to monitor them

1260
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,839
okay i'm gonna ask a question and see if

1261
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,839
anyone has anything to add to it

1262
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,760
um have you seen any bad assumptions in

1263
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
cyber security that you would want to be

1264
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,520
addressed to want to know why people

1265
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,560
make these assumptions

1266
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,359
i see professor spafford is lying are

1267
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,839
you ready for a lecture

1268
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,280
actually i think i'm talking to him

1269
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,079
about this tomorrow

1270
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,079
okay from george how would i suggest

1271
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,680
applying these principles in less

1272
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,078
academic settings so

1273
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,280
an incident response um that

1274
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,040
that's usually what i think about this

1275
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,480
an incident response

1276
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,800
for example when i dealt with them i

1277
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,319
didn't just go random around

1278
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,000
and collect data and go i shall collect

1279
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
data for my incident response

1280
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,319
i had a plan i always started with a

1281
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,880
plan the checklist was my plan

1282
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,800
checklist was a very fond plan of what

1283
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,400
um how to collect the data and

1284
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,560
it's also following the checklist

1285
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
and collecting the data to do the

1286
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,319
checklist

1287
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,240
but you know having a plan and sticking

1288
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,000
to the plan i didn't just randomly

1289
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
decide oh i shall wander over and do

1290
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,599
this other thing rather than find the

1291
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,800
attribution

1292
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,880
i stuck to my plan and i always planned

1293
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:14,000
ahead of time

1294
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,079
and collecting not collecting enough

1295
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,800
data is also a major problem yes

1296
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,760
um cyber security data for one thing

1297
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,040
there's a ton of it

1298
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,800
and the other thing is collecting it

1299
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
it's also very hard

1300
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,480
i'm actually working on a paper right

1301
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,640
now where what i needed

1302
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,000
was peak caps from malware and i didn't

1303
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,880
just need

1304
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,920
okay hey look this piece of malware went

1305
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,160
to the c2 server and came back

1306
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,520
i needed it you know actual

1307
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,839
data of what was happening and finding

1308
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,839
that was hard i found some

1309
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,720
but it um finding the data is hard in

1310
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,240
general um

1311
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,599
and people do make okay i have 10 pieces

1312
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,560
of data i've made an

1313
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,839
assumption and i can tell you a whole

1314
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,680
story about the 10 pieces data i'm like

1315
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,800
um

1316
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,640
no but thanks for trying

1317
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
but this is this is not actually a

1318
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,480
problem in just cyber security i was

1319
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,240
talking to a co-worker about this who

1320
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,920
just machine learning

1321
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,839
and she was actually explaining to me

1322
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,880
that it is for example studies on autism

1323
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,200
you might have 10 participants so you

1324
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,880
have people drawing conclusion on

1325
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,680
autism based on a study of 10 people

1326
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,640
and you really can't say you know you

1327
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,720
can't do the same thing

1328
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,319
you just can't say that about people

1329
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,119
with autism at based on 10 people

1330
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,839
people are weird

1331
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,400
there are two questions that are in the

1332
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,319
q a okay q

1333
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,000
a yes um

1334
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,319
any suggestions for cyber security

1335
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,839
internet privacy

1336
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,520
research is using for gaps in the

1337
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,119
literature

1338
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,079
that is a very good question um

1339
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,400
so i i have a very weird background

1340
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,839
and that i spent years in industry

1341
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,839
before i ended up as a researcher

1342
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,079
and when i end up looking at things and

1343
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,920
going hey wait a minute i remember

1344
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,400
doing that and it didn't work like that

1345
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,720
one of the first things i found at cert

1346
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,280
was actually that these domains were

1347
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
excuse me these name servers were

1348
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,440
changing ip addresses very rapidly

1349
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,200
and i can tell you as someone in

1350
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,520
industry changing the ip address of a

1351
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,640
name server

1352
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,000
is a multi-day headache

1353
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,160
we did it once the second time we

1354
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,079
changed routing rather than changing the

1355
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,960
ip address of the name server okay so i

1356
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,680
knew that that

1357
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,440
shouldn't be happening so i investigated

1358
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,200
what was going on and it turns out to be

1359
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,240
involved with pharma spam

1360
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,640
so it's if you start with a good

1361
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,200
basis and how things work and you just

1362
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,520
look around some you know look at data

1363
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
or talk to people i'm actually working

1364
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,119
on a process right now

1365
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,480
where i talked to a vulnerability

1366
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,359
researcher and i said hey

1367
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,280
how do you think vulnerabilities happen

1368
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
and now i'm going to see if i can prove

1369
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,440
what he said actually is true

1370
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,760
you talk to people and you should be

1371
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,200
able to get my email address if you want

1372
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,640
to talk to me as well

1373
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,480
i will be happy to answer any questions

1374
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,920
and if i have any ideas i'll point you

1375
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,880
to them

1376
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,400
um a lot of us just looking at what's

1377
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,520
going on in the world

1378
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,760
i can tell you here's an example we got

1379
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,640
a paper and a d

1380
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,559
trap on ethereum smart contracts

1381
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,200
finding reviewers on ethereum smart

1382
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,319
contracts was not

1383
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,760
easy because it is so new

1384
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
not too many people had written on it so

1385
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,440
finding people who actually had the

1386
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,079
background

1387
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,000
in order to review a paper on ethereum

1388
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,839
smart contracts

1389
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,480
i think i asked 30 people and all i

1390
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,599
needed were three reviewers

1391
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,920
okay next question pqc

1392
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:13,839
uh remind me what pqc is

1393
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,760
because i'm not sure what p q s i don't

1394
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,200
remember that acronym sorry

1395
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,319
and for the minimum quantum computing oh

1396
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,880
post

1397
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,000
um we're actually looking at doing a

1398
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,440
special issue for dtrap

1399
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,000
on quantum computing and the digital

1400
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,559
threats

1401
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,119
of post of quantum and quantum crypto

1402
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,040
so i don't know i don't have enough

1403
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,720
background on that yet i'll let you know

1404
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,520
after i read the d-trap special issue

1405
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,880
and if there's anyone interested in

1406
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,160
working on a detroit special issue

1407
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,200
i'd be loved to hear about it and the

1408
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,200
minimum significance sample size

1409
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,599
i will defer that one to statisticians

1410
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,839
because i am not a statistician

1411
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,200
sorry i just write about it sometimes

1412
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,280
and because that is one of those things

1413
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,400
where

1414
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,480
sometimes the only number of people you

1415
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,000
can get are 10

1416
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,640
for example the autism study i actually

1417
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
did some reading on some studies

1418
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,079
uh there was one that was done

1419
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,480
essentially on i wanted to say

1420
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,760
vulnerability no it was on

1421
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,359
anyway it was done essentially by

1422
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,520
finding people at black hat and

1423
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,200
defcon and interviewing them and

1424
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,839
i think they had 20 people because

1425
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,680
that's all they could find

1426
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,520
i've seen another one where they were

1427
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
looking for experts in cyber security in

1428
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,440
a certain field and you had to have a

1429
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,960
certain level of knowledge

1430
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,880
and the number of people who fit that

1431
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,240
was very small

1432
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
and the number of people would actually

1433
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,720
answer the questions even smaller

1434
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,559
so sometimes it's totally what you have

1435
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,800
to be able to ask

1436
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,240
and gadgets uh gadgets is actually in

1437
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,598
software vulnerabilities

1438
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,559
gadget is a software vulnerability there

1439
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,200
there is a return condition in the code

1440
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,040
that can be hooked into

1441
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,319
to create an exploit

1442
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,480
and determining which are actually you

1443
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,559
know exploitable is one thing

1444
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,720
determining how exploitable is another

1445
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,839
thing uh

1446
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,400
it's it's basically an example of why

1447
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,079
waiting everything the same is not a

1448
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:32,880
good idea

1449
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,760
any other questions

1450
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,520
thank you very much for being our uh

1451
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,680

1458
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,760
series

1459
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,599

duke university will give you a talk on

1462
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,000
secure federated language

1463
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,880
i'm sorry secure federated learning so

1464
