when he was at google um

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,640
really where we should have invited him

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,359
back

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,320
much sooner than this but this is in

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,599
conjunction with

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,559
the recent publication of his book big

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,360
breaches

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
cyber security lessons for everyone you

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
see

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440

reading through

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
um myself and i can recommend it

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
as as i was saying earlier as a set of

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
both enlightening and horrifying stories

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
so we're going to let uh neil tell us

26

ventures funded

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,319
we were in the business of detecting

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,319
malicious ads that cyber criminals were

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,760
uploading

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
and we got acquired by twitter about a

and continued to co-direct the stanford

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
advanced security program together with

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
dan monet and john mitchell at stanford

88
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,519
absolute privilege

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
working together uh with both of them um

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
i i have been spending a lot more time

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
as an advisor i'm a limited partner in a

92
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
bunch of funds

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
and one of the one of the reasons that

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,959
uh i co-authored this book together with

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,879
libby albayadi is because

96
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
i wanted to get an understanding not

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
only of well

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,120
where has the 45 billion dollars of

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
cyber security funding

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
uh both private equity and public ipo

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
funding gone over the past 15 years

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
but what have they funded uh what have

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
been the root causes of breaches

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
and how are we doing with regards to

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
addressing the root causes of breaches

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,280
and

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,000
why is the world the way it currently is

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,720
with still

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,159
you know one big breach happening after

110
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,480
the other um so i'm going to spend

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,439
most of the time today talking about the

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,200
histories and the stories

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
of some of the biggest creatures that

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
have taken place i probably won't have

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
time to get through all of them

116
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
but what i will do is i will sample them

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,879
and

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,959
the first half of the book pretty much

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,239
focuses on

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,239
you know the histories and stories uh

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
and and the key lessons to be learned

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,040
from these big regions the second half

123
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,680
of the book

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,238
focuses on a roadmap to recovery

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,199
starting with

126
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
what are the right habits that an

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
organization should put in place to

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
achieve

129
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
security and uh for those habits we

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
we were in part inspired by stephen and

131
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
cubby's habits for

132
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
uh interpersonal skills and success and

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,639
whatnot but

134
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
uh we came up with seven such habits for

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
security and we draw upon decades of

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
research that have already been done

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
so i'll talk a little bit about that

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
i'll also talk a little bit about

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
um the technology defenses that

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
organizations can employ

141
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,199
to specifically target the root causes

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
of breach one of the challenges in the

143
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
field is that

144
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
there's many many security compliance

145
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
standards there's hundreds of check

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
boxes to check but the question is

147
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
um should we just uh do the minimal work

148
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,039
to check each checkbox

149
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,080
or are is there a smaller set of

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
say root clauses that we should target

151
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
and put strong scientifically effective

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
countermeasures in place for

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
in order to address the overwhelming

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
majority of

155
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,520
uh things that could result in breaches

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
so let me start talking about some of

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
the big breaches

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
and let me start by talking about just

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
some stats

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,880
from privacyrights.org so privacy

161
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
rights.org has cataloged

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
over 9000 reported breaches that have

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
taken place ever since 2003

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
which was when california passed the

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
first

166
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
data breach notification law and then

167
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
many many states followed

168
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,840
and they basically um

169
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
annotate each of these breaches with a

170
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
a clause and so i've

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
diagrammed out those clauses here in

172
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
this histogram and you can see

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,520
that the biggest bar that they attribute

174
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
is to

175
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
hacking or malware um at the same time

176
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
there are some pretty significant bars

177
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,039
here for breaches that are due to

178
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,000
physical loss

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
and that are due to portable devices now

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
one thing to keep in mind with regards

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
to both

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,199
physical loss of same media that might

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,479
not be encrypted

184
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,479
or mobile phones or laptops that get

185
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,160
stolen or lost and that might not be

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
encrypted

187
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
those result in breaches because the

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
data is not encrypted

189
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,360
if the data was encrypted then

190
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
there would not be a breach under the

191
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
legal reach notification laws

192
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
you can have incidents you can have

193
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
compromises you can have all kinds of

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
things happen

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
but if you have encrypted the data and

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,080
you keep that secret key safe then

197
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
you know all kinds of things can get

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
stolen so in any case while it looks

199
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
like our hacking or malware may be our

200
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
biggest problem i would say that

201
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,880
making sure to get all data encrypted is

202
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,599
still a

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,440
a big problem it's just kind of

204
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,639
surprising that

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
many many decades after the advent of

206
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
aes and dez and a whole bunch of other

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
encryption standards that uh

208
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
you know the encryption's just simply

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
not turned on everywhere that it perhaps

210
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,080
needs to be

211
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,520
and then of course once data is

212
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
encrypted you can

213
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
have uh you it does make sense to worry

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,400
about

215
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
uh third parties uh getting into into

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
one systems uh unauthorized third

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,919
parties of course

218
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
and uh we also have to keep in mind that

219
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
when somebody's account gets phished

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
or a password is used off the dark web

221
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
um and shared passwords are used

222
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
between different systems effectively

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
once you have a valid credential

224
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,919
whatever systems that use that

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,680
credential will happily decrypt data for

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,080
you

227
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
so you need to worry about that as well

228
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
in any case so there's a bunch of

229
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
causes here but i want to highlight some

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
of those clauses

231
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,120
um in particular

232
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
on this slide i list out a bunch of the

233
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,120
big breaches

234
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
and what were their root clauses i'm

235
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
going to chat about this in a lot more

236
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,400
detail but uh this is a quick summary

237
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,280
slide if you want to

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
refer to it at a later point um i also

239
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
have a couple slides here that

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
just uh give a table of some of the big

241
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,520
breaches on a per year basis

242
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,759
um and summarize what got stolen in the

243
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
breach and what type of data it was and

244
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
so the impacts were

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,759
but let me go through some of the

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,080
stories and let me go back to the

247
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
target breach in 2013. the the target

248
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,520
breach

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,399
was interesting because uh it was the

250
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,120
first

251
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,958
mega breach after which both the ceo

252
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
and the chief information security

253
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
officer the cso got fired

254
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
the board also got sued uh it may have

255
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
been the case that prior to this breach

256
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
that uh you know the cso or ahead of i.t

257
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,279
might get fired if there's a breach but

258
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,839
what happened in this breach was with

259
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,279
over 40 million credit

260
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
card numbers getting stolen and i'll

261
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,120
talk about how they got stolen

262
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,959
um the accountability went

263
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
up the chain to the ceo and up to the

264
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
board

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
the way that this breach had occurred

266
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
was that attackers initially got into

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
one of target's third parties they got

268
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,480
into

269
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
they broke into a company called uh

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
foster mechanical services

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
that was responsible for running the

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
heating and air conditioning

273
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
in uh all the target retail stores uh

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
and they also

275
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,959
did such work for many other retail

276
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,480
chains as well part of it was not

277
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
the only one but the attackers basically

278
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
were able to steal some network

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
credentials from positive account

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
services and then use that to pivot into

281
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
target's network because

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
effectively the networks were not very

283
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
well segmented or segmented at all

284
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
and so one was able to get in through

285
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,320
the heating and air conditioning

286
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
systems and then pivot in to pivot and

287
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,760
laterally move

288
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
into eventually the uh point-of-sale

289
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
stations which attackers infected with

290
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
malware

291
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
and what they did is you know prior to

292
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,399
thanksgiving

293
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
uh 2013 they started to

294
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
exfiltrate small amounts of data and

295
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,440
when they saw

296
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
it working then they basically turned it

297
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,519
on full screen

298
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
and that's when um the attack got

299
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
noticed by the way

300
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
target you think the pretty retail

301
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,519
pretty big retail company

302
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
uh they've got to have had some defenses

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,680
in place to say identify malware that

304
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,399
was getting

305
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
injected into their systems and and

306
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
indeed they did they were a customer of

307
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
fireeye

308
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
and had spent uh over a million dollars

309
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
on fire-eye equipment

310
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
um the alerts from the fireeye equipment

311
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
were getting escalated from

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
a team in india to their team in the u.s

313
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
um and uh the problem was that there was

314
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,440
enough

315
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,959
noise and there were enough false

316
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
positives that they had previously seen

317
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
um combined together with the fact that

318
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
the malware was given a very generic

319
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
categorization

320
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,640
malware.binary as opposed to something

321
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
more specific and so the results

322
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,480
uh the alerts were not acted on

323
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
as aggressively as they as they could

324
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,839
have so uh

325
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,120
that's a little bit about the target

326
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
breach and some of the

327
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
some of the ways that it could have been

328
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,279
prevented better network segmentation

329
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,360
uh enough staff to know where to get the

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
malware efforts and and

331
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
having malware alerts that were that had

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
just a lower false positive rate would

333
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,279
have would have helped

334
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,920
um you know the overall impact was

335
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,079
target had to pay over 250 million in

336
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
breach costs and uh suffers from some

337
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
reputational damage at the time

338
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
uh the stock price did take a temporary

339
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
hit and then

340
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
uh came back and uh you know today uh

341
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,200
target

342
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
runs you know one of the best uh you

343
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
know kind of threat intelligence centers

344
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
um in a in organization so so they've

345
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
they've turned this around

346
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,920
uh that's not to say they couldn't get

347
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
reached again but uh that's a little bit

348
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
about target reach

349
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
the very next year jp morgan chase one

350
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,839
of the largest banks in the united

351
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,399
states

352
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
uh got breach uh what happened in that

353
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,079
breach

354
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,240
is that there were 70 million customer

355
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,079
names and email addresses got stolen

356
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
and you could imagine that for a bank

357
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
you could have a lot worse things happen

358
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,480
right if

359
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
attackers were able to break in and

360
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
transfer money uh that would that would

361
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,959
have been

362
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,880
much worse um being a large bank jp

363
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
morgan chase was also spending

364
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
over 250 million annually on their

365
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
security program

366
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
and so one might ask the question wow

367
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
that's a lot of money how did how did

368
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,839
they get reached

369
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
well they they also got bleached through

370
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
a third party

371
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
they were using a third-party

372
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,639
web management company called cinco data

373
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
systems that was running the website

374
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
for their charitable marathon races

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,760
and what happened was the attackers

376
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
were able to compromise one of those

377
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440
website certificates

378
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
and start getting access to passwords

379
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,639
that

380
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
employees were using on that chart of

381
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
the marathon race website

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
now as we know users often

383
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279
share passwords between systems when

384
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
they shouldn't and so there were a

385
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,399
number of employees at jpmorgan chase

386
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,920
that were using the same password

387
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
for the charitable marathon race website

388
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,519
as they were

389
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,720
for their corporate uh

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
banking logins um and so you know there

391
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,959
there are certain passwords uh in place

392
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
uh but you one would expect that any

393
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,600
bank of this size

394
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
is also using two-factor authentication

395
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
such that even if a password got stolen

396
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
an attacker would have to uh beat the

397
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
two-factor authentication as well

398
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
well jpmorgan chase did have two-factor

399
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
authentication in place almost

400
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
across all their systems there was uh

401
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
one or a small number

402
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,880
of servers that they had that did not

403
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
have the two-factor authentication

404
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,279
enabled

405
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
and so with the combination of some of

406
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,720
the passwords

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
uh getting compromised due to the

408
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
website certificate getting compromised

409
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
um and the attackers have visibly known

410
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,519
the passwords and the fact that there

411
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,160
was just

412
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
even just one server where they could

413
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,399
log in using those

414
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,360
stolen passwords um without the 2fa they

415
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,399
were able to

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,880
get in uh to some of the bank systems

417
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
and then pivot pivot if it laterally

418
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
move until they got to a database that

419
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,360
had 70

420
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
million plus customer names and uh email

421
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,040
addresses

422
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
now of course the the the you know you

423
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
ask yourself what's the risk there

424
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,480
um you know is it really i mean is

425
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
the theft of customer names and email

426
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
addresses really that bad well

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
uh for those of us that have been in the

428
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
security field for quite some time we

429
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,920
know that the way that

430
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
most phishing attacks used to happen was

431
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
attackers used to blanket consumers

432
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
uh with imposter emails claiming to be

433
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
one bank or the other they typically

434
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,279
choose a

435
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
large bank uh that many many consumers

436
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
might be using and hope that one of them

437
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,360
clicks

438
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,000
on the link in the email and goes and

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,720
logs in

440
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,399
the impostor website with their

441
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,240
credentials but

442
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
if you're an attacker and you've stolen

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
70 million customer names and email

444
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
addresses from a single bank

445
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,040
and you know that they're customers it

446
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
makes those customers

447
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,760
much more susceptible to spear phishing

448
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
attacks much more targeted efficient

449
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
attacks because you know they haven't

450
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
accounted for the bank

451
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
uh post this post this breach jpmorgan

452
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,000
chase

453
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,079
doubled their security budget to over

454
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,440
500 million

455
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
and um went about uh

456
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
using standards like dkim and dmor such

457
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,480
that

458
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
it makes it harder for attackers to

459
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
craft and pass for emails i think for a

460
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
long time in the security field

461
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,320
we've been chasing um the the

462
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,120
the goal of end to end digitally signed

463
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
and encrypted emails

464
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
and while that still eludes us as an

465
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,759
industry

466
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,279
one is able to use standards like dkim

467
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
and dmarc to sign emails on behalf of an

468
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,279
organization

469
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,800
and put public keys

470
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
in dns entries such that any email

471
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
client or any um you know any email

472
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
client or any isp

473
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
can check as to whether or not the email

474
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
might actually be coming from that

475
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
organization uh and it's great to see

476
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
that jpmorgan chase now

477
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,680
has deployed dmarc with a 100 reject

478
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,959
policy side

479
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,320
for those folks that are interested in

480
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
anti-painting defenses here if you

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
haven't previously

482
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
heard uh or are using dkim and d-mark

483
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
i'd encourage checking them out

484
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
the next breach that i'll talk about is

485
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,320
uh the office of personnel management

486
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,959
breach from

487
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
2015 uh what got stolen in this brief

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
was over 20 million

489
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
sf-86 background check records so for

490
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,839
those of you that have done

491
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,279
work with the government it might be a

492
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,839
government contract or have gun

493
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
secret clearance you probably have to

494
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,800
fill out this sf-86 form which asks you

495
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,079
not only a whole bunch of extensive

496
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
information about yourself

497
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,519
including your social security number

498
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,600
but includes such information about your

499
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,000
family

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
members friends neighbors as the vetting

501
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
process to become

502
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,480
an employee in a government organization

503
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,599
is significant

504
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
and the office of personnel management

505
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,839
was pretty much serving as the chief hr

506
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
organization for most government

507
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,959
agencies

508
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
um not including the the cia

509
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
but you could imagine that let's say

510
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,599
if you're a foreign nation state

511
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
adversary let's say

512
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,919
you know the chinese government and you

513
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,640
want to

514
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
determine who are the cia agents that

515
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,559
might be in your country

516
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,000
what you could do is you could look at

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
every all the aliases and all the names

518
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,120
that are on file

519
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
with your state department and you could

520
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,559
subtract out

521
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,400
the set of uh names

522
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,200
that were stolen from the opm breach and

523
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
the much smaller list that's left

524
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
is your set of candidate cia agents

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
so this was a this was such a

526
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
significant breach that when when

527
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
um congress uh investigated it

528
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,760
a number of folks uh felt that the the

529
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
the it was a major major

530
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
counterintelligence uh setback uh

531
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
the impact could not be overstated nor

532
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,840
would it ever be known

533
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
and it would probably take at least a

534
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
generation or two to be able to

535
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
recover from this to this extent that

536
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
one can recover from such things

537
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,760
um how did how did the opm get reached

538
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
well

539
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
let me mention that the the

540
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
you know uh

541
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
the typical management failures that

542
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,320
occur uh

543
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,440
are the failure to prioritize

544
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
cyber security the failure to invest in

545
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,880
cyber security

546
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
and the failure to execute on cyber

547
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
security nationals successfully

548
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,200
in the case of opm they were only

549
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,160
investing

550
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
seven million dollars annually into

551
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
their cyber security program when even

552
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,000
the department of agriculture

553
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
was investing over 70 million uh so that

554
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,919
that's a pretty significant

555
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
under investment in security in fact uh

556
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
when it came down to a tactical level

557
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
opm did not have two-factor

558
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,480
authentication deployed at all

559
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
and um uh the the

560
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
whatever anti-malware defenses might

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
have been in place were completely

562
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,160
insufficient

563
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
at the time that they were breached it

564
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
was identified that one out of every

565
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,919
five machines

566
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
at the opm were infected so

567
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
having you know using basic defense so

568
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
once you once you decide to prioritize

569
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
in the dust using basic defenses

570
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
like multi-factor authentication um

571
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
anti-malware

572
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
and also taking uh legacy systems and

573
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
making sure

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
that if they can't be patched for

575
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
whatnot that they're sectioned off

576
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,440
um uh segmented uh and that you put

577
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
other defensive systems in place

578
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
in front of them if you can patch them

579
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
along which is very important to do

580
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
um it was it was surprising to me that

581
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
in the in the aftermath of the opm

582
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,760
breach

583
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
they gave the government employees that

584
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
were infected that were affected

585
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,880
um credit monitoring services for maybe

586
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
a year or two

587
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
but uh that's a far cry from full

588
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
and affect protection that encompasses

589
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,159
monitoring your assets as well as your

590
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,159
credit instruments

591
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
and um you know when a foreign nation

592
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
state gets this kind of data

593
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
heck they could use the the stolen

594
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
metadata about

595
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
government employees to try to mint

596
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,159
spies in the country

597
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
and get them employed at government

598
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,440
agencies so

599
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
the the kind of defense that that was

600
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
kind of put out there with just

601
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
basic credit monitoring i think was was

602
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,039
pretty

603
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,760
insufficient in my very humble opinion

604
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
um in any case let me talk about a

605
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
couple other breaches

606
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
um um as if

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
as if these breaches thus far have you

608
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
know weren't bad enough the very next

609
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,760
year

610
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,080
yahoo announced that they had

611
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
two breaches actually that actually

612
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
occurred in 2013 and 2014

613
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,480
but they had disclosed them in 2016.

614
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,039
um what they had found is that in 2013

615
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,679
and 2014 they had various um

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,640
internal systems that got reached due to

617
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,159
spearfishing malware

618
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
in which attackers were able to steal

619
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
500 million and a billion accounts from

620
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,039
their

621
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,559
user database um but

622
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,600
what was much worse is that

623
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,520
once the the four russian

624
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
hackers two of which were fsb agents

625
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
when they when they

626
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
broke it in they uh reverse engineered

627
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
yahoo's cookie generation algorithm

628
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,679
and so for for those of us that know how

629
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,000
uh

630
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
authentication basic user and password

631
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,360
authentication on the web works

632
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
you know that when you log into a

633
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
website with a username and password

634
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
um one of the one of the cookies that

635
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,080
you get back is uh what is an

636
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,440
authentication cookie once your

637
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
credentials have been checked

638
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
uh you're given this authentication copy

639
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,679
and it's really the authentication

640
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,400
cookie that

641
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,720
then goes uh back and forth between the

642
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
browser

643
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,159
and the server that authenticates you uh

644
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,679
he is a stateless protocol

645
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,440
and so if you don't want to have to keep

646
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,280
on entering the user and password on

647
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,799
every single page it's that cookie that

648
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
ends up authenticating you but once the

649
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
attackers were able to

650
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
uh steal the source code that yahoo used

651
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,559
to generate their cookies

652
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,760
they were able to at will log into

653
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
any of the over three billion yahoo

654
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
accounts

655
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
um just knowing the email address they

656
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,480
didn't even need to go to password

657
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
um this has been the largest breach in

658
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
the history of the internet

659
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,440
in terms of the number of accounts that

660
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
were exposed to the breach

661
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
uh the breaches were disclosed while

662
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,480
yahoo

663
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
was in the process of getting fired by

664
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
verizon and uh

665
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,960
verizon had initially agreed to acquire

666
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,200
yahoo for 4.8 million dollars

667
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
that price was dropped by 350 million um

668
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
in part to help deal with the the breach

669
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
costs so that's the

670
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
that's the yahoo breach in summary and

671
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,240
by the way i know i'm getting giving

672
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
kind of very high level

673
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
uh summaries uh there's of course a lot

674
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
more details in the book around

675
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,559
how uh each of these breaches occurred

676
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,600
including even

677
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,559
uh delving into more technical details

678
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
but i think the goal of the talk here is

679
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:24,880
to

680
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
to extract what are some of the high

681
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,000
level themes

682
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,039
and uh suddenly move on to the next uh

683
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
breach from the very next year 2017

684
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
in 2017 equifax got breached in what was

685
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
the largest financial identity

686
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,640
reach in the united states approximately

687
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,840
half the country

688
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,440
had their credit records stolen and

689
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,720
i i think it was pretty well known in

690
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,320
the media that the way that this breach

691
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,440
occurred the way that the initial

692
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,240
compromise

693
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
occurred was equifax was

694
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
running a unpatched apache swap server

695
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,520
and uh you know didn't didn't patch that

696
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
server

697
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
in time and uh it appears that there

698
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,520
were some

699
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,440
uh you know uh chinese or chinese-funded

700
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
attackers that uh that broke in

701
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
um i i will say that there was a lot

702
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,120
more

703
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,400
that went wrong beyond just

704
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
an apache swap server not being patched

705
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,159
so at the time that the patch was uh

706
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
made available and released

707
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,279
equifax did have a internal

708
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,640
global threatened vulnerability

709
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,279
management team that started scanning

710
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,039
um equifax uh for such vulnerabilities

711
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,360
they also sent emails out to about 400

712
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,799
employees

713
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,480
telling people to go ahead and patch the

714
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
apache shred server but there there's a

715
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
whole bunch of things that were as wrong

716
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,919
with

717
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,760
um you know the approach and the way

718
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,480
things played out so first of all

719
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,200
for any vulnerability management program

720
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,720
at any significant organization

721
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
you know just sending out emails and

722
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
expecting humans to

723
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
uh you know react to those emails and

724
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,919
patch stuff

725
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,039
is is not what typically makes up

726
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,400
what's called a a closed loop uh

727
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,159
workflow management around

728
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,080
vulnerabilities that also includes

729
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
technical verification so most

730
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
organizations that have

731
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
a more sophisticated technical

732
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,039
vulnerability management program

733
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,480
will have a scanner generate a whole

734
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
bunch of tickets in an automated way

735
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,240
and then allow maybe humans to

736
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
do the patching and claim that they

737
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,760
have patched the systems but

738
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
not let humans close out the tickets

739
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,520
uh saying that the vulnerabilities are

740
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
addressed rather it is important to have

741
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
technical verification have a

742
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,559
vulnerability scanner

743
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
go out and rescan to make sure that

744
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,720
vulnerability actually got addressed

745
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,159
and then have the system close the

746
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,080
ticket uh for those of you that might be

747
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,559
interested in

748
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,559
putting such a system in place i

749
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,320
recommend an open source project called

750
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
aegis

751
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
which i have a reference to in the book

752
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
that can help put that kind of system in

753
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
place

754
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
that said even even if they had that

755
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,400
kind of system in place

756
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,120
um one other problem with the way that

757
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
vulnerability management was being done

758
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,039
at equifax was that they were using an

759
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,159
end-of-life

760
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,559
vulnerability scanner for mcafee and so

761
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,520
for those of us that have been in

762
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
software for a long time

763
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
we know that the second that products

764
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
end of life it's not going to get

765
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
patched it's not going to get maintained

766
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:33,840
there's

767
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,200
not going to be more innovation going

768
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,279
into it identify the

769
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,120
the next set of best vulnerabilities in

770
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
this case um

771
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
and uh the the the team equifax well

772
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,559
aware

773
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,000
that um you know that that scanner was

774
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,880
end of life

775
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
and what was happening is when the

776
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
mcafee vulnerability scanner

777
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
was going up and scanning equifax's

778
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,200
systems to

779
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,279
try to identify the apache struts

780
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,400
vulnerability

781
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
it was only looking in route directories

782
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,919
of

783
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,240
servers for the vulnerability it was not

784
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
looking in subdirectories of the server

785
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,159
and a particular patch to struts

786
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,919
vulnerability that existed on

787
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,480
the relevant equifax server was in a

788
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
subdirectory

789
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
so the threat vulnerability management

790
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,279
team was doing scans

791
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,440
but didn't realize that they were not

792
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
that they didn't realize that they were

793
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
blind

794
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,120
because their vulnerability scanner

795
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,159
was falsely reporting that there was no

796
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,679
vulnerabilities when in fact there's

797
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,919
still work

798
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,039
in addition uh once the attackers used

799
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
the apache strut's vulnerability to

800
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
initially compromise a server because of

801
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
the fact that there was a fairly flat

802
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,679
network within equifax

803
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,120
the attackers were able to get

804
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
visibility into approximately 60

805
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
databases

806
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
and they dropped 30 web shells into the

807
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,399
equifax environment

808
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,559
uh and you know compromised many of

809
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,159
these databases in different ways

810
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
as needed uh in some cases they were

811
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,159
able to find unencrypted credentials for

812
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,360
some of the databases

813
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
in configuration files and were able to

814
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
exfiltrate data

815
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,520
in that way in other cases um

816
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
they were um able to take advantage of

817
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
the fact that there was

818
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,799
sql injection vulnerabilities and they

819
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,720
would uh inject a

820
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,240
jsp page to exploit the

821
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
simple injection vulnerability to

822
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
exfoliate more data and so while

823
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
the press kind of went on a blitz about

824
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,200
the initial compromise vector uh with

825
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
the apache structure vulnerability

826
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,480
there were a whole bunch of other things

827
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
that went wrong that resulted in this

828
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,880
breach

829
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,480
just because there was an unpatched

830
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
apache short server didn't necessarily

831
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
mean that there

832
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
had to be a breach there might have been

833
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,760
an incident there might have been an

834
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,679
initial compromise but there was there

835
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,880
you know had the right things been in

836
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,840
place there was still a lot of

837
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,640
opportunity

838
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
to have prevented at this breach so

839
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,360
that's an equitable speech

840
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,880
i'm going to talk about one

841
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,760
facebook breach and by the way over time

842
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
facebook has had a lot of different

843
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
hacks and breaches which i summarized

844
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
in some of these slides i think many

845
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,399
folks may have heard

846
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,199
about how

847
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,320
cambridge analytica had abused

848
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,120
facebook's

849
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,480
services and had

850
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,799
take advantage taking advantage of data

851
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
on 87 million profiles

852
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,399
that were um were

853
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,279
were assembled by cambridge analytica

854
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
combing through

855
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,399
you know what a whole bunch of folks

856
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,440
liked um and then used that data

857
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,039
to advertise to voters in swing states

858
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,159
in the

859
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,880
uh in the 2016 us presidential election

860
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,039
you know after that facebook had locked

861
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,080
down

862
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,159
the usage of their api so that you

863
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,120
couldn't as

864
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,399
easily have third-party developers

865
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,360
scrape information about facebook users

866
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,399
um

867
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,960
but one might ask the question that if

868
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
you're a foreign nation state

869
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,760
and you're still interested in that kind

870
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
of profile data

871
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,679
to target voters or do whatever you want

872
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,360
with it the question is how do you get

873
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,000
at that data

874
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,360
even after facebook's locked down their

875
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,320
apis so i'm going to talk about

876
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,240
uh the facebook view as breach that

877
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
occurred in 2018

878
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,200
so for many of you that have used

879
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
facebook you know that there's this

880
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,679
feature

881
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
where you can view your profile as a

882
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,520
member of the public you know

883
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
when i look at my author page for

884
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
instance on facebook which i really

885
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
don't use

886
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
too aggressively but when you look at

887
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,559
that there's

888
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,120
a whole bunch of editing capabilities

889
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,159
and whatnot

890
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,480
and you can click on this button saying

891
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,440
view as visitor

892
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
and it'll then show you what your page

893
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,880
looks like if you were

894
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
a member of the public and didn't have

895
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,679
all the capability to edit your profile

896
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,799
well in 2018 there was a

897
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,039
a pretty sophisticated breach that

898
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,919
occurred

899
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
in which the attackers used three

900
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
software vulnerabilities

901
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,559
in tandem to scrape

902
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,919
tens of millions of facebook profiles

903
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,320
even

904
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,880
after their apis have been locked down

905
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,600
so

906
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
the first thing that went wrong the

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,039
first vulnerability

908
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,120
was that there was a a box

909
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,159
um that allowed

910
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,159
people to wish their friends happy

911
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,279
birthday

912
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,840
um and unfortunately

913
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,399
um when you when you use the view as

914
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,279
feature

915
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,480
it uh or rather uh it basically

916
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
allowed people to post videos when

917
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,880
it should not have let people post

918
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,480
videos so so when you're

919
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,559
when people um view your profile

920
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,480
as just a member of the public they were

921
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
able to not only wish you a happy

922
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
birthday but they were able to post a

923
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,159
video

924
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,919
the second thing that went wrong is that

925
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
facebook issued an update to their video

926
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,120
uploader

927
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,799
which generated access tokens

928
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,679
effectively part of the cookie that had

929
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,440
full permissions of the facebook mobile

930
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,919
app

931
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,440
and then the third thing that went wrong

932
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
and this was the kicker was

933
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,039
that when um

934
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,320
when the video uploader was used in this

935
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,200
capacity

936
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
it generated an access token

937
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,799
not for the for the person as a viewer

938
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
but for the person that was being looked

939
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
up so effectively

940
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,720
um when you when you viewed somebody

941
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
else's profile

942
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
you were able to get full read write

943
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,279
access to their profile

944
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,679
instead of just being able to view it um

945
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,640
so any case there

946
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
there's three vulnerabilities that came

947
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
together for this uh

948
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,640
for this facebook had identified that

949
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,440
there was

950
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
a whole bunch of more usage of their us

951
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,559
feature

952
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,799
taking place uh except it was taking

953
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
place by an attacker and when they

954
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,120
investigated they were then able to root

955
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
clause that it was due to these three

956
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,720
software vulnerabilities that the breach

957
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
was able to occur i think they initially

958
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,320
uh issued password resets for about 90

959
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,519
million profiles

960
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,360
but upon investigation they determined

961
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,799
that it was i think

962
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
30 million profiles that were affected

963
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,159
but it was

964
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,159
i i thought this was was pretty

965
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,120
interesting and a level of

966
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,000
sophistication

967
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
that that was kind of like well beyond

968
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
you know just one vulnerability or

969
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,279
some phishing and some malware um

970
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,919
let's see the very uh same year marriott

971
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,559
also

972
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,080
got reached they acquired rice of course

973
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,720
uh

974
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,799
the largest uh hotel chain company in

975
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,840
the world uh

976
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
they were in the process of acquiring

977
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
starwood hotels

978
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
starwood hotels had actually been

979
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
reached four years prior

980
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,120
but when marriott was doing their due

981
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,360
diligence to do their acquisition

982
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,039
uh they hadn't recovered the fact that

983
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,799
starwood had been breached and so the

984
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,320
kind of big lesson here without getting

985
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
all the details is that

986
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
if you're a big company and you're

987
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,720
acquiring another company and the

988
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,840
company that you acquire

989
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,480
is breached uh you're reached as well so

990
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,399
initially that company is a third party

991
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,679
but once you acquire them they're a

992
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
first party and uh

993
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,240
you know there was a you can read the

994
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,679
chapter for more details on this but

995
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,159
that was the that was the big takeaway

996
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,679
um let's see i'm just going to talk

997
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,199
about one or two more breaches i'm going

998
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,879
to talk about the capital one

999
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,159
breach and we go into a little bit more

1000
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
technical detail on this one uh the

1001
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
capital one breach when it occurred in

1002
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,639
2019

1003
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
uh it was the largest cloud security

1004
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,639
breach of all time

1005
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
to an extent i think it still is the

1006
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,679
largest cloud security breach of all

1007
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,239
time

1008
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,639
capital one is of course a very large

1009
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,399
financial institution

1010
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,800
they were probably the financial

1011
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
institution that most

1012
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,520
aggressively adopted cloud services and

1013
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
adopted amazon's cloud services

1014
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,960
and in 2019 what had happened is there

1015
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,280
was

1016
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,399
a single loan attacker

1017
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,879
a former amazon employee who happened to

1018
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,760
have

1019
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,199
some technical skills but didn't have

1020
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
any insider knowledge and

1021
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
that attacker who went by the code name

1022
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,040
of erratic

1023
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,160
uh got was able to was able to

1024
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,119
steal a hundred million credit

1025
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,240
applications

1026
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,760
from capital one's uh cloud systems

1027
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,800
uh the way that the attack

1028
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,560
was identified was somebody had

1029
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
capital one didn't proactively detect it

1030
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
on their own somebody wrote into their

1031
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
uh vulnerability disclosure list saying

1032
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
hey there's a github repository that

1033
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,520
looks like it has

1034
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,000
100 million of your credit applications

1035
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,240
in it you might want to check this out

1036
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,599
um and uh so from the time that capital

1037
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
one got that email i mean within

1038
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,400
two weeks they they they looked at the

1039
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,200
github

1040
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
git lab repository it happened to have a

1041
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,119
radix

1042
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,160
resume in the repository together with

1043
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,960
the

1044
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,440
stolen data and so it was a pretty quick

1045
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,079
turnaround

1046
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,480
from them being notified to getting the

1047
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,839
authorities involved to

1048
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,079
arresting the the attacker the attacker

1049
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:54,960
got you know

1050
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
quarter million dollar fine and five

1051
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,720
years in jail but uh the breach costs

1052
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,000
for capital one

1053
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
uh were estimated to exceed uh 100

1054
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,560
million and i think that there's been

1055
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
some regulatory fines

1056
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,440
uh already of 80 million and

1057
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,240
the costs may still continue the way it

1058
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,880
occurred

1059
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,240
was they had one of their ec2

1060
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,040
virtual machine instances that had a

1061
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
server-side request for

1062
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,440
vulnerability and there was

1063
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,720
a a misconfiguration

1064
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,440
um in one of their aws boxes let me talk

1065
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,640
about the details it could have been

1066
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,079
prevented through a fire

1067
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,920
you know better firewall review or more

1068
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,000
automated cloud security again let me

1069
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
talk about how the bridge happened

1070
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,200
so this diagram shows on the left the

1071
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
attacked machine

1072
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,079
on the far right there's amazon's

1073
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,640
uh vulnerable virtual machine instances

1074
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,320
um

1075
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,240
it had a server-side request for

1076
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
vulnerability

1077
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,800
and then um the buckets the

1078
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
simple storage service uh data buckets

1079
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
that had the hundred billion credit card

1080
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,760
applications

1081
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
are shown in the middle here uh they did

1082
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,320
you know there's been a lot of there

1083
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,920
were a lot of cloud security breaches

1084
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
prior to this where

1085
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
a whole bunch of organizations just

1086
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
simply left a bunch of data buckets

1087
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
public inadvertently um and so booze

1088
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,160
allen hamilton and the pentagon and a

1089
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,599
whole bunch of other

1090
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,440
organizations there's a table of all the

1091
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,960
organizations that left buckets publicly

1092
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
exposed back in 2017.

1093
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,320
at least in this case the bucks are

1094
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
private but

1095
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
the attacker was able to get in as

1096
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,079
follows

1097
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,280
the attacker was able to notice because

1098
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,480
of the server-side request board

1099
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,400
removability the attacker was able to

1100
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,599
pose queries

1101
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,720
to the ec2 instance which the ec2

1102
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,640
instance would relay onto the metadata

1103
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
service so

1104
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,760
virtual machines running in amazon need

1105
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
to rely on this metadata service to get

1106
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,599
basic information about themselves like

1107
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,880
what is my ip address

1108
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
so i can communicate with other virtual

1109
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
machines um

1110
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
one of the other things that a virtual

1111
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
machine can do when it talks the

1112
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
metadata service in amazon which is

1113
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,320
intended

1114
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,440
only to be uh used locally you can ask

1115
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,599
well what security credentials do i have

1116
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
and uh you know that that in itself is

1117
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
not a bad thing

1118
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,920
but the problem was that um some

1119
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,119
software running on this

1120
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
vulnerable virtual machine instance um

1121
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,960
effectively would be able to take

1122
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
queries from

1123
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
pretty much anybody on the internet it

1124
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,359
would relay those

1125
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,880
queries under the metadata service and

1126
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
because of the server-side equestria

1127
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
very availability it was it was able to

1128
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,119
it would pass on and relay the response

1129
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,920
onto the under the third party so so

1130
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,359
this in the field of computer science is

1131
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,359
what we call the confused deputy

1132
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,480
um you know the metadata service uh is

1133
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
effectively a confused deputy because

1134
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,520
it's thinking that the

1135
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,079
software that's accessing process that's

1136
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,720
access

1137
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
asking questions and getting responses

1138
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,320
is this is just

1139
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
only this you know virtual machine

1140
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
instance which is

1141
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
you know there for good reason and run

1142
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,599
there to run capital one services

1143
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,640
but because of the fact that it could um

1144
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,800
accept queries and urls and then

1145
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,480
inadvertently relay the responses onto

1146
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
the attacker

1147
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,599
uh the attacker was able to post parties

1148
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,040
to the metadata service

1149
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,280
that typically only the virtual machine

1150
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,040
instance should have been able to

1151
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,520
and so after asking hey what security

1152
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
credentials do you have

1153
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,240
uh the attacker was able to say okay

1154
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,599
please go ahead and actually give me the

1155
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,240
credentials and um

1156
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,079
the attacker would get the access

1157
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,280
ids and secret keys for this uh

1158
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,320
for this web application firewall

1159
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,280
webroll

1160
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
uh iam account and uh once the attacker

1161
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,680
had these legitimate credentials uh she

1162
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
was able to

1163
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,640
locally catch them in our command line

1164
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,240
interface and then

1165
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,040
pose queries to capital one's data

1166
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,920
buckets

1167
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,480
um and just ask hey can you give me a

1168
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,400
list of all the different uh

1169
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
bucket names and folders that i i can

1170
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
access and

1171
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,440
because at this point the attackers

1172
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
coming with legitimate credentials

1173
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
the s3 buckets were not able to tell the

1174
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
difference between

1175
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
the illegitimate hacker and legitimate

1176
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,760
systems

1177
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
and uh you know when the attacker then

1178
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
asked hey if you just go ahead and read

1179
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,319
the data

1180
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,200
the s3 bucket said sure here you go so

1181
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,160
that's uh

1182
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,400
you know very short summary uh a little

1183
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,599
bit more technical in some

1184
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,920
previous explanations of how the capital

1185
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,440
one breach occurred there's of course

1186
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,480
more details in

1187
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,319
the chapter um but uh that that was the

1188
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,319
largest cloud security breach of all

1189
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,040
time

1190
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,720
occurred in 2019 um

1191
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
in 2020 when myself and my co-author

1192
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,720
were writing our book

1193
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
we were waiting for what is going to be

1194
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,920
the big breach in

1195
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
in 2020 and all of our publication

1196
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
deadlines were in october

1197
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,000
and november of 2020 and uh

1198
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,640
so we um you know there have been a

1199
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,920
couple

1200
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,040
insider attacks and

1201
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,960
attempted insider attacks that took

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,480
place uh at

1203
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,160
uh tesla and twitter and spotify

1204
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,680
um but nothing bad that

1205
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,400
was was was really big for the course in

1206
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
mid-december 2020

1207
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,400
uh the solarwinds attack uh was

1208
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,359
announced

1209
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,560
fireeye had identified that

1210
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
attackers had broken to their systems

1211
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
and stolen

1212
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,680
some of their attack tools via

1213
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,720
a third-party software package uh

1214
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
made by a company called solarwinds

1215
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,560
solarwinds actually has 300 000

1216
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,760
customers out there

1217
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,359
uh they have a product called orion that

1218
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,000
um is used to do it performance

1219
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
monitoring

1220
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,280
um attackers had broken into solar winds

1221
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,440
and modified their build pipeline

1222
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,119
so that the attackers could modify

1223
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,599
the version of the software that was

1224
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,720
being produced

1225
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,359
they in particular attacked uh injected

1226
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,800
just one file

1227
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,920
um and they um in a

1228
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
you know pretty sophisticated fashion

1229
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,200
what they did

1230
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,240
was they even took care of race

1231
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,960
conditions

1232
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,920
and made sure that when solarwinds was

1233
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,599
piling their software

1234
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,319
that when the compilation was occurring

1235
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,040
the

1236
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,160
they would you know grab a mutex on the

1237
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,079
appropriate file inject their own

1238
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,119
and then um replace the original file

1239
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,880
um so that the version of the software

1240
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,560
that got built uh

1241
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,960
was different than what solarwinds might

1242
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,000
have expected

1243
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,119
and then the attackers use that

1244
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,040
capability to issue a malicious code

1245
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,680
update

1246
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,359
to approximately uh you know 16 or 18

1247
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:49,920
000

1248
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,119
organizations um a number of which were

1249
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,640
government agencies so attackers had

1250
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
broken to nine government agencies

1251
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,319
including the department of justice

1252
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,040
from homeland security uh the u.s

1253
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,200
treasury the u.s commerce department

1254
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,359
uh the attackers had also gotten

1255
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,560
visibility into

1256
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,319
microsoft source code because microsoft

1257
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,160
was also a solarwinds customer

1258
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,000
and you know one of the things that i'll

1259
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
mention though is that

1260
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,920
in the solarwinds hack while what the

1261
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,200
attackers did

1262
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,000
when they broke in was sophisticated you

1263
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,400
know

1264
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
i i've had some conversations with

1265
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
the the new ceo at solarwinds uh subaru

1266
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,200
krishna

1267
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,079
uh he is a great guy he's been handling

1268
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:32,640
this

1269
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,800
breach in a very transparent way and

1270
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,240
he's focused on

1271
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,599
um you know making things better

1272
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,960
um but they initially had about 16

1273
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,920
hypotheses

1274
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,160
as to how the attackers initially got in

1275
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,000
and they've limited that down to

1276
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,040
three last i heard um and

1277
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,160
those three are pretty much similar

1278
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,319
to the five or six technical root causes

1279
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,240
of breach that i've already mentioned

1280
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,359
um so uh you know we will be putting out

1281
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,359
a chapter on the solar winds

1282
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,119
uh hack um since uh it occurred after

1283
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,720
um the chapter deadlines uh so if you're

1284
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,160
should go to brickreachers.com

1285
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,200
sign up and you'll get that chapter um

1286
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
but that's a little bit about what

1287
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
happened uh solarwinds

1288
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,000
this had effectively sounded the alarm

1289
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,640
for uh third-party uh software

1290
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,839
vulnerabilities in any case i've talked

1291
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,200
about a lot of breaches

1292
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
uh this year there's also been an oil

1293
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,119
pipeline that was shut down

1294
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,160
for a week due to a ransomware attack

1295
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,480
some folks are are you know ransomware

1296
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
is just a type of amount where

1297
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,440
uh a lot of people are

1298
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,040
are believing that now ransomware

1299
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,359
attacks are a matter of national

1300
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,480
security

1301
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,000
um uh i am i'd like to leave sometimes

1302
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,280
the question so i want to

1303
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,640
talk a little bit about um

1304
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,240
roadmap to recovery how do we get to a

1305
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,920
better state and

1306
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,599
in the second half of the book that's

1307
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,200
pretty much what we focus on

1308
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,240
we we start off the first chapter in the

1309
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,440
second half of the book

1310
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,640
um we we talk about seven habits for

1311
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,480
highly effective security

1312
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,160
um and you know some of these

1313
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,280
uh like habits one and seven around

1314
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,359
being proactive prepared and paranoid

1315
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,359
and number seven embracing continuous

1316
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,640
improvement kind of

1317
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,240
mirrors some of steven covey's uh habits

1318
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,520
for personal success but there's a

1319
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,880
number of other habits here that are

1320
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,560
super important including building

1321
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
security and privacy in

1322
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,640
and you know when we talk about that we

1323
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,839
we go back to

1324
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,400
early papers from salsa and schroeder on

1325
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,920
the protection of computer information

1326
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,720
systems

1327
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
and what we do is we illustrate some of

1328
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,760
the principles that they first talked

1329
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,000
about

1330
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
50 years ago with some more modern day

1331
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,280
examples

1332
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
um you know i i also believe it's

1333
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,640
important to

1334
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,680
put quantitative measures in place

1335
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,800
for security in particular measuring

1336
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,480
how effective your counter measures are

1337
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,240
uh scientifically effective your counter

1338
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,920
measures are for the root clauses of

1339
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,160
reach is extremely important i'm sure

1340
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,119
uh an organization has you know hundreds

1341
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,880
of check boxes that they need to check

1342
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,119
to be compliant but pretty much every

1343
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
major organization that's been breached

1344
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,960
has been compliant at the time of breach

1345
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,200
so while compliance can help

1346
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,400
uh set in motion some impetus for

1347
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,960
for good security hygiene it is really

1348
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,160
important to focus

1349
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,319
on what are the root causes of reach and

1350
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,680
put in um

1351
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,079
counter measures that should be measured

1352
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:34,960
uh and

1353
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,200
automated as much as possible so anyhow

1354
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
i've just talked a little bit about some

1355
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,000
of these habits

1356
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,119
um and by the way i i do feel that for

1357
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,000
the major

1358
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,160
root causes of reach so i i mentioned

1359
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,359
earlier that

1360
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,560
you know you've got to have some

1361
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,119
managerial uh things going right you've

1362
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,000
got to be

1363
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,440
prioritizing cyber security at a

1364
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,560
management level you've got to be

1365
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,920
investing in cyber security

1366
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,359
appropriately and you've got to be

1367
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,359
executing on cyber security initiatives

1368
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,400
but beyond that

1369
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,319
there's really just five or six

1370
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,960
technical root causes of breach

1371
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,520
um you know at this level of abstraction

1372
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,000
uh

1373
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,240
and scientifically effective

1374
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,599
countermeasures

1375
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,240
exist for most of them so so for

1376
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,800
instance

1377
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
if we're concerned about phishing and

1378
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,000
account takeover

1379
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
which has come up in just breach after

1380
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
breach after breach

1381
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,559
if you deploy hardware security keys

1382
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,319
like uv keys or if you use the hardware

1383
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,079
security

1384
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
key functionality that exists in most

1385
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,400
iphone and android phones

1386
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,040
basically you can nearly eliminate

1387
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,960
phishing from happening so when google

1388
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,319
for instance deployed

1389
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,280
yuva keys back in 2017 to all their

1390
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,160
employees

1391
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,839
even though they have regularly been

1392
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,359
under the threat

1393
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,599
and target of nation-state attacks there

1394
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,720
there has not been

1395
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,319
one successful phishing account takeover

1396
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,720
that's worked against a google employee

1397
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
salesforce has also deployed similar

1398
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,119
such

1399
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,079
defenses to a subset of their employees

1400
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,760
the department of defense uses

1401
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,079
uv keys but we could pretty much

1402
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,839
eliminate phishing if we if we start

1403
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,920
using hardware security keys

1404
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,040
across all organizations so so to an

1405
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,079
extent

1406
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,839
i feel that we've got to adopt those

1407
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,359
defenses that are

1408
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,880
that have been shown to scientifically

1409
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,800
work and deploy them

1410
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,400
more aggressively um you know there's

1411
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,480
other areas like software security

1412
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,119
uh where you want to prevent both

1413
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,960
first-party and third-party software

1414
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
security vulnerabilities

1415
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,680
uh where there's a whole bunch of

1416
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,520
technology static analysis dynamic

1417
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,480
analysis

1418
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,000
um there's nothing that's kind of

1419
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,599
foolproof but there is a whole bunch of

1420
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,640
things that you can

1421
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
you can use to lower probability of

1422
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,400
breach due to due to software security

1423
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,280
vulnerability

1424
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,800
in any case i don't have time to cover

1425
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,400
all of the different uh

1426
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
you know countermeasures here um

1427
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,960
but there there's there's more in the

1428
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,440
book um and i would just encourage

1429
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,359
folks to primarily invest

1430
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,880
when they construct their security

1431
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,440
programs in addressing the root causes

1432
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,400
of breaches

1433
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,520
um don't get taken

1434
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,680
uh get too excited about you know what's

1435
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,520
the most recent buzz in the security

1436
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,960
marketplace or from a particular

1437
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,000
security vendor

1438
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,960
uh don't focus on you know just

1439
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,800
achieving compliance assuming that

1440
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,079
achieving compliance will buy you

1441
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:24,800
security

1442
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,240
the plan should be achieved as a side

1443
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,720
effect uh so in any case i've gone

1444
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,520
through

1445
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,240
a myriad of breaches uh and the root

1446
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,839
causes and the lessons learned i've

1447
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,760
talked about what i believe are the

1448
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,880
root causes based on data um

1449
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,680
and encourage an approach that focuses

1450
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,359
on addressing the causes i think there

1451
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,040
is a lot of room for continued

1452
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,000
innovation

1453
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,960
uh in in our field um but i think that

1454
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
with many of the reasons that are taking

1455
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,359
place

1456
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,200
uh they they could pretty much be

1457
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,960
preventable and averted

1458
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
uh if you simply employ some of the

1459
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,400
better defenses

1460
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,440
that have been shown to be

1461
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,160
scientifically affected today

1462
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,520
thank you well thank you neil

1463
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,040
um certainly it is the case that

1464
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,640
those who don't learn from the past are

1465
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,040
going to be condemned to

1466
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,319
recapitulate it so

1467
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,000
i think your book could probably be

1468
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,280
updated on a regular

1469
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,359
basis every three months for the

1470
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,640
indefinite future here um

1471
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,480
i i i think maybe we'll do we'll do one

1472
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,000
new chapter for every year and just

1473
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,200
cover the biggest free trial

1474
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
of every year and and i think you're

1475
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,319
exactly right back there's also another

1476
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,000
saying that uh you know

1477
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,520
even though the future may be different

1478
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,000
from the past it might rhyme

1479
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
so yeah well

1480
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
um i have a question a couple questions

1481
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,640
now that have shown up

1482
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,640
and one goes right to your conclusion

1483
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,680
many of these companies and

1484
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,760
organizations have

1485
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,040
mandated compliance testing and audit

1486
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,640
such as pci uh how many of them actually

1487
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,200
met those requirements and still were

1488
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,319
breached

1489
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,319
they were all to the best of my

1490
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,319
knowledge compliant

1491
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,720
at the time of reach so target for

1492
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,240
instance was

1493
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,839
pci compliant at the time of breach

1494
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,119
they had a been given a

1495
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,960
uh an aoc um

1496
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,240
so so i think one should not assume that

1497
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,680
one is secure

1498
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,839
just because your complaint now what

1499
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,280
happens uh

1500
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,400
you know with some compliance

1501
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,640
organizations is that after a breach

1502
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,680
occurs

1503
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,920
you know if the compliance organization

1504
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
wants their compliance certification to

1505
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,800
mean something

1506
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,960
they can go in afterwards to say oh you

1507
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,400
know they couldn't possibly have been

1508
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,040
compliant

1509
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,240
right um and and they could find oh

1510
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,280
there's a whole bunch of things that

1511
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,520
were really wrong but then why was a

1512
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,319
why was a compliance certificate given

1513
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,440
right so i think

1514
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,920
compliance is very very useful it can

1515
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,720
encourage

1516
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,440
a whole bunch of good security hygiene

1517
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,079
but

1518
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,400
compliance does not equal security and i

1519
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,079
would encourage folks to focus actually

1520
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:06,960
on security

1521
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,720
and try to achieve compliance as much as

1522
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,520
possible as a side effect

1523
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,559
that's that's great advice um

1524
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,240
we had one person wondering if the

1525
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,000
slides will be available in some way

1526
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,880
or not yes i can make the slides

1527
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
available absolutely

1528
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,920
okay um

1529
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,680
i guess if you want to send us a pdf and

1530
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,000
anybody requests a copy or we can link

1531
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,119
them in on

1532
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,880
the serious page um

1533
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,720
so another question really here about

1534
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,359
about auditing and compliance

1535
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,280
if uh a third party caused a breach

1536
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,920
for someone uh but they were audited and

1537
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,599
passed and then what's the benefit of

1538
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,720
that audit uh

1539
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,559
how do we how do we get audits that are

1540
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,800
really worthwhile

1541
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,400
so i think that it would be great

1542
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,720
for so the typical challenge i haven't

1543
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,000
haven't been a shifting major security

1544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,040
officer myself

1545
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,400
one of the challenges that you have is

1546
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,480
you have you have to be

1547
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,160
compliant right otherwise you don't get

1548
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,680
to process the credit cards

1549
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,480
or you have to be compliant uh say with

1550
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,480
hipaa otherwise you don't get to process

1551
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,400
patient information so you have to be

1552
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,119
compliant and you have 200 check boxes

1553
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,280
that you need to check across a whole

1554
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,319
bunch of domains

1555
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,119
but what i would encourage the

1556
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,800
compliance committee

1557
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,839
compliance community to do is to look at

1558
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,880
what have been the root causes of the

1559
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,839
breaches

1560
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,720
and perhaps prioritize

1561
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,119
the effectiveness of countermeasures for

1562
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,960
those root causes so it's not just good

1563
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,599
enough

1564
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,119
to have some antivirus package running

1565
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,640
most of the malware that gets deployed

1566
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,800
these days is uh

1567
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,280
new malware variants unknown malware

1568
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,720
created to target a specific

1569
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,599
organization

1570
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,880
that doesn't match any previous

1571
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,640
signature so if for instance you're

1572
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,559
using an anti-malware defense

1573
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,079
that only checks for known signatures

1574
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,280
and is say not leveraging

1575
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,760
you know some kind of ai algorithm to

1576
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,760
look for previously unknown threats

1577
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,880
uh uh you know then then chances are

1578
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,440
that that

1579
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,480
anti-malware defense while it might

1580
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,680
check a box may not be sufficient

1581
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,119
um and so one thing we can do is iterate

1582
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,240
our compliance standards to

1583
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,880
take into account how the breaches have

1584
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,240
mostly been happening

1585
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,119
and prioritize the security controls and

1586
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,240
countermeasures

1587
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,839
that can prevent those things and sure

1588
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:38,720
there's a whole bunch of other things

1589
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,440
that should be done

1590
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,839
for good hygiene um and i think that's

1591
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,920
one way that can raise the bar

1592
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,839
in the compliance movement great

1593
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,040
um another question that's uh

1594
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,960
not directly about the breaches perhaps

1595
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,160
but

1596
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,040
what do you think about having greater

1597
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,720
penalties

1598
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,000
on those caught

1599
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,839
breaking in or misusing systems do you

1600
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,200
think that's going to discourage

1601
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,880
that kind of bad behavior so thus far

1602
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,640
um the federal trade commission the sec

1603
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,240
a number of different government

1604
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,319
organizations have been

1605
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,839
imposing increasing fines

1606
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,960
and numbers of fines um and that has

1607
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,599
been having

1608
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,480
some impact i think a lot of boards are

1609
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,280
now taking

1610
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,960
cyber security more seriously simply

1611
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,359
because uh they could have a significant

1612
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,319
regulatory

1613
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,440
then um i think the largest such fine

1614
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,880
that i'm aware of

1615
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,920
is uh facebook was fined

1616
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,440
five billion dollars uh

1617
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,799
for um privacy

1618
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,240
uh violations of their ftc consent

1619
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,119
decree

1620
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,480
uh back in 2019. five billion dollars is

1621
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,079
a significant amount of money for most

1622
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:58,960
organizations

1623
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
maybe not for facebook maybe it's a few

1624
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,799
weeks of their revenue

1625
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,160
but i think one thing that

1626
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,400
perhaps we can take away is that it's

1627
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,880
either too early to tell

1628
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,119
whether the increasing amount of fines

1629
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,559
is having as much impact

1630
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,400
as we want it to or um

1631
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,839
fines in and of themselves of a company

1632
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,520
here and a company there

1633
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,119
um you know may not be sufficient

1634
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,559
um and so one question

1635
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,799
i wonder about is does it make sense for

1636
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,160
instance i don't know

1637
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,319
if ransomware is indeed a national

1638
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,760
security threat these days

1639
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,480
should we be giving companies more tax

1640
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,520
credits

1641
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,440
to encourage further spending on cyber

1642
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,880
security like

1643
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,760
you know we're still in a world where

1644
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,880
you know like you said every three

1645
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,440
months there

1646
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,960
there's some uh new big breach and uh

1647
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,240
you know there have been years of

1648
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,400
fines getting imposed uh more and

1649
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,359
increasing

1650
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,640
but um it's it it's either probably too

1651
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,920
early to tell

1652
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,559
uh whether or not they're working uh or

1653
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,680
maybe we should make the

1654
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,880
worst case assumption that it's not

1655
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,040
working and provide other incentives as

1656
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,720
well

1657
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,160
yeah there was a there was a kind of a

1658
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,000
follow-up question here

1659
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,960
that uh you mentioned one ceo and one

1660
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,839
cso

1661
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,799
were fired but um what about the

1662
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,960
breaches generally was it just limited

1663
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,119
to that or

1664
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,559
were there were there other kinds of

1665
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,640
personnel penalties applied

1666
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,000
there have been other personnel

1667
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,839
penalties uh applied

1668
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,559
um so i i think i talked specifically

1669
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,640
about the target breach

1670
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,359
but if we look at the equifax breach for

1671
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,000
instance

1672
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,119
um you know the ceo uh

1673
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,559
changed um the cso changed

1674
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,440
um and that's been occurring in other

1675
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,480
breaches

1676
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,200
as well so um you know i don't have a

1677
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,880
kind of comprehensive list but but but

1678
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,599
there is

1679
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,760
ceo and board level accountability for

1680
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,000
cyber security breaches today

1681
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,760
so any case i hope folks have found

1682
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,040
found this material interesting

1683
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,359
if you're interested in learning more um

1684
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,079
please uh

1685
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,839
come check out uh the stanford advent

1686
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,280
cyber security program

1687
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,400
uh um where we have all kinds of courses

1688
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,079
ranging from foundation to security to
