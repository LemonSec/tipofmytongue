1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
thank you very much for the introduction

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,800
um it's a pleasure to be here with you

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
guys today

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,560
um i hope we'll have a little bit of fun

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
with this i tend to take myself not too

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
seriously um and we'll make some jokes

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
about security and have a little fun

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,679
with my background history here

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
but then have uh hopefully informative

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
discussion on attacker history evolution

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
motivations and what i think that means

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
for us as

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
defenders and blue teamers today

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,920
so

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,119
before

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,560
if we can get our slides to cooperate

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
here before we get deep into attack

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
revolution um the first thing i actually

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
would like to do is talk about

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
who i am and why you should care about

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
anything i have to say

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
first and foremost i am the chief

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,280
security officer at critical start and

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
because that title generally is

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
completely ambiguous it means nothing

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
i'll go into a little bit more detail at

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
critical start i currently run

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
everything that encompasses security

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
operations

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,079
cyber threat intelligence

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
detection engineering

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,559
as well as everything in customer

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
success

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,600
support

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
implementations

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
and

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
our entire portfolio that rolls up

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
through managed services

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
so as a company

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,280
we are a managed service and detection

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
and response organization and everything

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
that goes into the operations of that

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
belongs to me within the organization so

44
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
when it comes to dealing with incidents

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,920
intrusion response and actively

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,759
detecting and stopping breaches for

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
customers that all falls under my

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
responsibility

49
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,720
i understand that i still look like i

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
could be attending here or i graduated

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
high school and if i shaved i can pass

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
for this guy with ease but i have been

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,200
doing this for

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
as long as this was still a thing for

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,799
those of you who may not have been

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,119
around back in those days that goes all

57
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,280
the way back to about here

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
i started my career here where i began

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
doing this before anybody even talked

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
about formulating these guys

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,960
because i did

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
cyber in the navy most of my friends

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
seem to think my job should have looked

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,720
something like this

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
in places like this

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
in reality it starts off looking more

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
like this in places like this

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
i spent time here floating off the coast

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
of here and here and after spending more

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
than enough time in places like this

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,040
and this i decided to go work here so

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
that i could hopefully spend a little

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,360
bit more time here

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
unfortunately i was incorrect because

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
after i went to work there i immediately

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
went back here

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
and spent another year or so deployed

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
because i worked here now all my friends

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,160
suddenly thought i must be this guy and

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
my job looked something like this and i

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,959
would try to convince them that they

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
were more accurate when they thought my

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
job looked like this and in reality it

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
mostly looked like this

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
after spending enough time doing this i

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
decided to go work here so i could do

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
less of this

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
and i spent eight years helping to build

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
and run global security operations

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
center

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
i had a tremendously good time working

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
there i had an amazing team met a bunch

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,159
of incredible people and we built up a

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,120
global 24x7 followed a subtle sun model

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
stock on a very large sim deployment and

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
learned an incredible amount of hard

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
lessons about dealing with apt threats

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
today

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
after eight years i decided to go work

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
here initially where i came in as a cto

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
and then helped build out our soar

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
platform and now like i said i run the

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
operations branch of our mdr division

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
on a personal level i'm a big aficionado

105
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
of this which i spend entirely too much

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
money on and i'm addicted to doing this

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
which i spend way too much time doing

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
despite those vices

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
me and this beautiful lady have been

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
doing this for almost 19 years now we

111
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
have four of these which on instagram

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
looks something like this

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
but in real life looks something like

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
this and most often something like this

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
which in the end brings me back to

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
this

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
so now that we've taken a trip through

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
my history

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,840
let's take a trip down attacker history

120
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,399
lane let's go all the way back to

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,279
here arpanet the army routing protocol

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
area network this was the internet that

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
bob dole invented

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
this is an early project an

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
interconnected systems over

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,880
modulated phone lines right you guys

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
remember the old modem days in an

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
attempt to interchange data

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
on connected systems mostly very early

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
versions of unix

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,479
but even all the way back then we had

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
our first instances of cyber attack the

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,360
morris worm some of you may have heard

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,240
of this

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
the morris worm was a worm developed to

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
self-propagate using a buffalo overflow

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,639
attack on the finger protocol a protocol

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
that doesn't really exist in practical

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
applications of linux today thank god

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
but this was the first in what should

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
have been a little bit of an alarm for

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
us to help us understand the potential

143
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
implications of lack of security

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
validation authentication or even

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,759
perimeter controls around interconnected

146
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
systems unfortunately it wasn't

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
and over the following years there was

148
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
an entire underground sub-community that

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
was developed around building knowledge

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
around hacking and attacks

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
vulnerabilities buffer overflows there

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
was a tremendous amount of skill and

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
data that was exchanged learned and

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
shared in fact this sub community became

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
so popular in such an underground

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
movement that we had movies made out of

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
it like these guys

158
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
which taught us all that our anthem

159
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
should be something like this

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
but in reality everything around

161
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,160
hacking and research and activity in

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
those days really came down to being

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
worried about reputation

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
people were trying to gain renown and

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
gain a name for themselves and become

166
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
known as something great in the hacking

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
community unfortunately we did some

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,800
really bad reinforcement learning on

169
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
this and that's some of the most

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
renowned hackers of these days who

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,720
performed very illegal activities were

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
often than giving very visible jobs in

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
high profile places because of the skill

174
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
set and how rare that skill set was to

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
try to stop other people from doing that

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
well this all began to come to a head in

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
the late 90s when there was a very large

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
problem with the solaris operating

179
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,199
system no not solar winds not sunbursts

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
but an attack that came before that and

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
that was called solar sunrise that was a

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,479
very large attack against the government

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
systems intelligence communities and

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
military systems the investigation was

185
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
primarily led by the fbi and disa at the

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
time and there was all kinds of theories

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
and speculation on the news about it

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
being something related to our

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
activities in this country and the first

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
not the second gulf war which i was not

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
old enough to deploy to at the time

192
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,000
um in reality it was actually just a

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
bunch of kids from here again this

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
should have been like a pearl harbor

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
style event for us in cyber security a

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,080
wake-up call

197
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
we had a couple of kids with a

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
relatively low motivation level but a

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
high level of curiosity and a mediocre

200
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
level of skill and they were able to

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
break into what were supposed to be

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
highly secured network segmented and

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
sometimes air-gapped quote-unquote uh

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
systems from the government and defense

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
and military and it required response

206
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
and operations and incident management

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
at a very high level someone from some

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,160
of the premier information warfare units

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
in the military at the time and it cost

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
hundreds of thousands of dollars in

211
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
response and millions of dollars in

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
system changes and yet we really didn't

213
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
do anything to make true systemic or

214
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
systematic change the way we looked at

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
security for cyber or what we still

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
called information security and

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
information warfare back then and the

218
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,280
evidence for this can be very clearly

219
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,759
seen and that not long after

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,560
we had this the melissa virus

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
and massive ddos attacks against all

222
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
kinds of different networks followed

223
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,879
very quickly by a whole set of worms

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,000
nymda

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
and code red

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,199
and then a plethora of different sql

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,639
worms that mostly could have been

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,240
stopped if we just changed our default

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
passwords from sa blank and sasa to

230
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
anything else

231
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
but this really brought us into an error

232
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,319
of experimental hacking and kind of

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,800
demonstrated the desire for the hacking

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
community to express their curiosity

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
their desire to learn and grow within

236
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
information security by actively

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
breaking the law and breaking in the

238
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
systems it cost lots of different

239
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
companies lots of money there were

240
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
companies that lost millions of dollars

241
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
from ddos attacks from the nimda and the

242
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
code red ones from sql worms in fact

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
some of those very worms impacted the

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
defense department just as much as they

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
did commercial organizations at the time

246
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
right but what really happened is there

247
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
was a change that happened when we enter

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,519
what i like to call the first criminal

249
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
age of cyber security and that change

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
really occurred at the first time

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
someone had the idea to say

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
give me money or

253
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
i'll ddos your network

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
and this was the very first concept of

255
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
ransom-based

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,200
cyber attacks

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,279
and these were mostly based around large

258
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
e-commerce organizations large banks

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
they impacted some of the largest ones

260
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,720
that we still have today

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
global banks and large very large

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
e-commerce organizations were actually

263
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
impacted and in fact some of them did

264
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
pay ransom to actually stop very large

265
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
ddos attacks from occurring and taking

266
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
their network down

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
now the unfortunate thing about that was

268
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
it didn't or the fortunate thing about

269
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,839
that was it didn't evolve and stay

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
around for very long but we did begin to

271
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
adopt all kinds of new malware like the

272
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
z-bot or zeus trojan family which was

273
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
primarily focused on fraud activity

274
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
identity theft and credential theft and

275
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920
was very very successful at the time

276
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
very hard to detect on endpoint systems

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
evasive and had multiple variants out

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,839
there it was very easy to change and

279
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,079
adapt that it was semi-modular as a

280
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
piece of malware

281
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
and for the time

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
well it was way ahead of the time

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
frankly speaking however we didn't

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,839
really see this proliferate in the same

285
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,279
way that we see

286
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
ransomware now or even other malware

287
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,000
attacks now and the question we have to

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
ask is if the money was there if it was

289
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
possible why didn't we see as much

290
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
activity back then as we do now

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
for this kind of thing and the reality

292
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,160
of it is is because that money was very

293
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
very hard to actually get payment for

294
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
most of these hackers that were

295
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
functioning out of parents basements

296
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
or coffee shops in small apartments did

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
not have the resources to open offshore

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
bank accounts

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
with anonymous tracing or fly down to

300
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
switzerland in the cayman islands to

301
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,959
open a bank account that would hold up

302
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,720
against the litigation power of the

303
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
united states if we were to try to come

304
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
down to them and so this money was not

305
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,079
able to be received in ways that were

306
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
effectively anonymous and therefore a

307
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
lot of this slowly faded away or at

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
least stayed semi under the radar and

309
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
what could be transacted on early

310
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
versions of the dark web with identity

311
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
theft in exchange

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,640
that all began to change right about the

313
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
year 2007 where we entered into the age

314
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
of cyber war when we transitioned from

315
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
information war to cyber war when we had

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
the first open or at least openly known

317
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
nation-state attack that was conducted

318
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
for political motivations by a large

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
nation

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
this nation estonia was what was

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
considered to be the largest

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
interconnected or internet savvy eastern

323
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
european bloc former soviet bloc country

324
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
at the time in fact many of you may

325
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
remember there was an entire wave of

326
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
offshore hosting and uh that occurred in

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
estonia because of high bandwidth low

328
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,480
cost availability tech talent that was

329
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
being raised up and it was a very well

330
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
thought out and well executed process

331
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
but during this wave of capitalism

332
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
growth and profit in this country there

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
also grew a very

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
anti-soviet sentiment and as a result

335
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
they decided to take down some of these

336
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
statues which represented occupation

337
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,560
times under the soviet regime and as a

338
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
result that seemed to take off a lot of

339
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
people and if you watch the media at

340
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
that time especially the media in that

341
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,399
area of the country they would tell you

342
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
that this was all done by and by that i

343
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,519
mean the cyber attack itself was

344
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,680
actually executed by pro-russian or

345
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
pro-pro-soviet

346
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,760
uh hackers and the reality of it is is

347
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,440
that we all know it was actually this

348
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
guy who was more than likely behind that

349
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
even if they never publicly disclosed it

350
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
but the resources that went into that

351
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,839
attack and effectively ddosing an entire

352
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,399
nation taking down services and causing

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,079
massive amounts of outage and revenue

354
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
loss as a response to the removal of

355
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,720
those statues was not done by

356
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
pro-russian dissidents inside of

357
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,760
estonia but what we have to understand

358
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
as a part of this is that this is not

359
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
the first time that information warfare

360
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
was conducted in fact those very same

361
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
guys the russians have been doing this

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
far longer than any of us have really

363
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,639
thought about it and certainly longer

364
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
than i've been involved in the industry

365
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
or community and we can go all the way

366
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,800
back to this thing to take a very good

367
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
look at what some of those things would

368
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
look like

369
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
some of you may know this is an ibm

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
selectric typewriter called a selectric

371
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
typewriter because it gave you the

372
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
opportunity to select the font that you

373
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
were going to use

374
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
well one of the earliest versions of

375
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,320
information or cyber attack if you will

376
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
was actually conducted on these devices

377
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
now that's hard to understand how that's

378
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,399
possible when you consider the fact that

379
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
they are not networked or interconnected

380
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,200
devices

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
but what happened was someone developed

382
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
a mechanical keylogger that could hide

383
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
inside this device and only be detected

384
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
by x-ray

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
log every keystroke that was done on

386
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
this device and then transmit that

387
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
outbound to a nearby listener on radio

388
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,839
frequency or across the radio so that

389
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
could be picked up and tracked by

390
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
anybody nearby

391
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
now these were deployed at major

392
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,199
government facilities at just about

393
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,880
every embassy that you can think of

394
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
around the world

395
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
and the people who created this key

396
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
logger also then purchased hotel rooms

397
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,600
or office space in nearby buildings set

398
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
up listeners and then logged keystrokes

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,600
for years from incredibly sensitive

400
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
locations devices including this key

401
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
locker being discovered and the

402
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,880
ambassador in russia and moscow's office

403
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
itself

404
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
and that begs the question of exactly

405
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
how much and how long data had been

406
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
stolen and we really don't know the

407
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
answer to that but we know a

408
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
considerable amount of damage was done

409
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
and that this was done before anybody

410
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
was thinking about information warfare

411
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
so well before anybody ever released

412
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
this report and if you don't know what

413
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,959
this is this is the apt-1 report by

414
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
mandiant that was released in 2011 this

415
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
is kind of the seminal white paper

416
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,760
covering the very first major apt actor

417
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
that we were able to give true

418
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,399
attribution to

419
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
i highly recommend if you haven't read

420
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
it go read it it's fascinating guys did

421
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
a phenomenal job writing this up when

422
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
they did it

423
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,959
but before this before apt one and

424
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
before this report people weren't really

425
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
thinking about actors in terms of nation

426
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,519
states or groups with combined

427
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
motivations or what they might actually

428
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
be doing but after this we began to

429
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,839
shift our perception to understand that

430
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
this kind of warfare has been going on

431
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
for quite some time and it is not

432
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
restricted only to

433
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
the military-industrial community in

434
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,519
fact

435
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,120
if we look at the target summary reports

436
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,680
for apt-1 we can see that there's quite

437
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
a bit on that target summary report that

438
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
has absolutely nothing to do with

439
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
military industrial in fact there's some

440
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
things that might ask you to or cause

441
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
you to ask questions about why they

442
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
would be targeting certain things

443
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
like

444
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,639
energy transportation construction and

445
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
manufacturing engineering sciences legal

446
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
services those are all fairly high in

447
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,880
the list of organizations that were

448
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,079
confirmed to have been targeted by apt-1

449
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
but to understand why those

450
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
organizations would be targeted by hb21

451
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,440
we first have to understand who they are

452
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
well first and foremost

453
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
they're a chinese pla threat actor we

454
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
know that they are part of the people's

455
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
liberation army and that they act on

456
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
behalf of the chinese nation to execute

457
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
their strategy in cyberspace

458
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
which includes the way that china

459
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
asserts its influence internationally

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
unlike

461
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
other nations which may do this

462
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
militarily right china asserts its

463
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
international power with economic

464
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,199
advantage especially when it comes to

465
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,160
cyber security so very much so when we

466
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
see activities related the chinese

467
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
actors in the cyber security world like

468
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
apt-1 what we see are things being done

469
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
to gain economic advantage like

470
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
intellectual property theft and the

471
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
stealing and replication of that

472
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
intellectual property at a lower

473
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
manufacturing cost and then putting

474
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
businesses out based on a competitor at

475
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
a lower price point this is a very

476
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,240
common strategy in fact it's an open

477
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
public strategy to conduct this kind of

478
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
activity against american public

479
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
companies

480
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,880
now

481
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
that's something we can use to

482
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
understand how apt-1 acts as a part of

483
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,119
pla but if we were to look again at this

484
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
guy and what he's trying to do we can

485
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,280
take a look at the target list here and

486
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,799
we can see that it is very very

487
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,760
different and in fact it reflects the

488
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,240
motivations that we often see that

489
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,799
russia likes to flex its international

490
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,919
influence

491
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
militarily we can see that demonstrated

492
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
in ukraine and crimea and georgia too as

493
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
well but we can also see it reflected by

494
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,360
ab28 apt-28 who is in fact a russian

495
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
cyber actor

496
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
and the targets by which they have

497
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,280
governments military international

498
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
organizations and embassies you can

499
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,240
notice

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
interestingly enough that on that target

501
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
map we see europe and south america but

502
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
absolutely nothing in north america

503
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
which would seem strange unless you also

504
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
consider the fact that the organization

505
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
who made this report also contracts for

506
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
the us government in cyber defense

507
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
investigations and forensics and is

508
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
probably under some kind of nda as well

509
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
as security clearance that they're not

510
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
allowed to disclose information about

511
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,320
any attacks that they

512
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
may have been part of investigating for

513
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
that organization when you consider that

514
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
then it makes sense that there were zero

515
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
attacks that would color in the map for

516
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
north america specifically for the

517
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
united states

518
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
now as these attacks from organizations

519
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
like apt-1 and apt-28 have become more

520
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,679
advanced to become more successful as

521
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,919
they've learned how to bypass controls

522
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
and establish persistence as they've

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
developed and work with new versions of

524
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
open source tools well these other

525
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
organizations that are out there have

526
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,120
also been paying very very close

527
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,160
attention

528
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
i think crowdstrike actually does a

529
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
phenomenal job of classifying and

530
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,799
tracking many of these organizations i

531
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
thought this was a great graphic these

532
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,679
are some of the guys that are out there

533
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
that are watching and they watched the

534
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,440
success they watched the tactics the

535
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
ttps that changed the adaptations that

536
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
needed to happen and they used that and

537
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
applied that to a new way to attempt to

538
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,120
make profit and when we combined those

539
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
changing and more successful ttps with

540
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
other things that were happening in the

541
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,080
industry

542
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
we saw a huge breakout that we're still

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
dealing with today and that is the

544
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
advent of modern ransomware which is a

545
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,200
massive cyber security pandemic if you

546
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
will that we are all dealing with that

547
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
you guys probably hear way too much

548
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,880
about but let's talk about the why

549
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,600
behind it why has ransomware been so

550
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
much more prevalent so much more

551
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,919
successful than it was then we saw

552
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,679
previous malware where we had denial of

553
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,280
service attacks which required or asked

554
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,559
for ransom where we had um attacks with

555
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,320
things like zebot and zeus variant

556
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,640
trojans that also stole identities and

557
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
were able to make money and now we see

558
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
this happening at a prevalence level

559
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
that is tremendously broader but we

560
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
invest way more money in cyber security

561
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
well to understand that motivation we

562
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
also have to consider the fact that

563
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
there is a very very close alignment

564
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,919
between the increase in ransomware and

565
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
the advent of cryptocurrency now and

566
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
this is not to say that i am not for the

567
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,000
value of a decentralized currency and i

568
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
am not throwing away the idea that this

569
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,720
can bring value to us as different

570
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
things that we can do on blockchain i

571
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
think are very very interesting but what

572
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
i am saying is that unfortunately the

573
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
fact that much of this currency can be

574
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
changed exchanged in a completely

575
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,799
anonymous manner has meant that it has

576
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
become a measure of liquidity

577
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
with complete anonymity and that has

578
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
what is what has led to a massive

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
increase in ransomware is now the

580
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
ability to receive anonymous payments at

581
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,760
least when done right anonymous payments

582
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
that can't be traced that you can't get

583
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,400
back

584
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,280
and

585
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
that are able to be conducted by just

586
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
about anyone in the world

587
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
and now the ability to get paid on an

588
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
attack has decreased in complexity so

589
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,360
much so that

590
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
ransomware attackers generally get paid

591
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
unfortunately stats say something like

592
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
one in every three attacks today

593
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,039
this has led us to what i refer to as

594
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,120
the second criminal age of cyber

595
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
security

596
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
and the second criminal age of cyber

597
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,200
security is marked

598
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
very very much by the amount of money

599
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
that has changed hands we are talking

600
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
about not thousands not millions but

601
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
billions of dollars in losses so much so

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,919
that even these guys have decided to get

603
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,080
in on the game and begin to play in the

604
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,679
cyber realm where they have both done

605
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
ransomware attacks as well as breaking

606
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
into cryptocurrency exchanges and

607
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
wallets to steal and to get around

608
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,159
sanctions in their country for how they

609
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,840
can bring in money they're actually

610
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,679
making money using cyber security

611
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,120
attacks

612
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
and we can see that there is a massive

613
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,200
increase if we go back to 2015 and we

614
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
look all the way forward to 2021 and

615
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
this is a report that was done by

616
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
reuters which i thought was very well

617
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,080
executed and researched you can go take

618
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
a look at it if you want to

619
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
from 325 million to 20 billion dollars

620
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,919
in estimated

621
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,919
annual ransomware damages

622
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,520
the differences

623
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,039
staggering

624
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,919
and there is definitely at least some

625
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,159
correlation you can argue this is not

626
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
causation and i would agree with you but

627
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
there is some correlation to be said

628
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
about the price

629
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
uh correlation between bitcoin and other

630
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
cryptocurrencies and the increase in

631
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
overall annual annual ransomware damage

632
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
again

633
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
cryptocurrency is not the cause but it

634
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
is now a primary liquidity mechanism for

635
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
people who are conducting these kinds of

636
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,600
attacks now we can't always just blame

637
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
that in fact there are many

638
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
many major other things that we can look

639
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
at in the world today and say well the

640
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
reason this is happening is because

641
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,960
there are people like maxine miyakobets

642
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,080
and yugo tereshev who are the heads of

643
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
evil corp many of you guys have probably

644
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
read articles about this and this is an

645
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
organization a tax-paying company in

646
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,880
russia who made an estimated 70 million

647
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,360
dollars last year conducting ransomware

648
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
attacks against u.s companies and they

649
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
operate with almost complete impunity

650
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
inside of russia provided that they

651
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
don't disrupt any russian interest

652
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
attack russian countries but they pretty

653
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
much have free reign to attack american

654
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
companies as it stands today which is

655
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
pretty significant and until we see

656
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
major policy changes we can't just say

657
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
well cryptocurrency has caused the

658
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
ransomware problem no actually

659
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
international policy and law and other

660
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
things that are out there that are very

661
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
advantageous for people who are in some

662
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
of these countries to actually conduct

663
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,919
these attacks without being prosecuted

664
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
by any standard or law that is out there

665
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,200
including

666
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
the law and the power of the u.s to go

667
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
after them which really doesn't exist in

668
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,240
some of these places

669
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
and until that changes we will continue

670
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,480
to see this problem

671
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
so the question we have to ask ourselves

672
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,120
is

673
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
why does this really matter to us

674
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,679
and hopefully we'll change slides as we

675
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,919
do that too there it is

676
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
what does this really mean to us and why

677
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
does it matter well if we take a look at

678
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
the motivations and we understand who's

679
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
behind these attacks and what motivates

680
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
them when we look at actors like apt one

681
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,679
and understand that they're looking for

682
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,360
economic advantage and we look at actors

683
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,440
like apt 28 and we understand they're

684
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
looking to assert military influence and

685
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,120
power and then we can look at actors

686
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
like evil corp and say they're clearly

687
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
after profit which is very much

688
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,880
available today we also have to ask

689
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
ourselves what is of value to us that we

690
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
need to protect that would allow them to

691
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
achieve any of these objectives in our

692
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
organizations

693
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
primarily speaking if we go back

694
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,000
historically especially i would say

695
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,559
pre-2015

696
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
right we were always concerned with pii

697
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
it was always about protecting the data

698
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
and most of us had a focus either from a

699
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
compliance and regulatory perspective or

700
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,159
strictly from our own desire to protect

701
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,440
data reputationally for our

702
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,840
organizations to protect that pii and

703
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
our customer data but the reality is is

704
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
and this has proven itself true over the

705
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
last five years is that availability is

706
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
equally if not more important there are

707
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,240
many times where people had data stolen

708
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
and they did not pay millions of dollars

709
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,279
to get that data back but they are most

710
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,200
certainly paying millions of dollars to

711
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
prevent disruption to their overall

712
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,679
availability especially for e-commerce

713
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,760
organizations and they're disrupting

714
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
revenue generation with those systems

715
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,559
too as well

716
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,480
so this may not primarily be about

717
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
reputation for the attacker anymore but

718
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
it is most certainly about reputation

719
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
for organizations these days like us

720
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
and that begins to drive to new kinds of

721
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,919
attacks new things we have to be aware

722
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,559
of like double jeopardy attacks

723
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,679
double ransom attacks if you will

724
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,120
at the first threat we're going to

725
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
encrypt and steal your data and then

726
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
threat number two if you also don't pay

727
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
us to decrypt the data that we've stolen

728
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
we will make it public right even more

729
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,039
so now we're skipping the triple dog

730
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
there and going straight to the

731
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,200
quadruple extortion attack where we're

732
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
now saying things like hey we're going

733
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,880
to encrypt your data and then you're

734
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,799
going to pay us to get it back or then

735
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,480
we're going to exfiltrate that data and

736
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,559
threaten to leak it but then also we'll

737
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
ddos you at the same time and take your

738
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
systems down and then even more so well

739
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
we'll have direct communication with

740
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,039
customers and stakeholders in fact

741
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
there's even some investigation reports

742
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,960
i've read where people have had direct

743
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
communication from somebody who

744
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
threatened to go to stock analysts who

745
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,120
are preparing to release

746
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,159
information about prices and quarterlys

747
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,840
and other things like that and they were

748
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
going to go to analysts and talk about

749
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
how the company had been breached and

750
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,159
that they had access to their data and

751
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,600
could take them down at any given time

752
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,480
so the question now is why are we

753
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
talking about this and what does it mean

754
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,360
to us

755
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
and then because no

756
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
cyber security presentation is complete

757
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,679
without a good quote from sun tzu

758
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,360
if you know the enemy and know yourself

759
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,039
you need not fear the result of 100

760
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
battles now interestingly enough almost

761
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
everybody talks about

762
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,559
know your enemy or know yourself

763
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
independently but this is talking about

764
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
both

765
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
we have to know the enemy as much as

766
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
much as we know yourself the emphasis

767
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
often is on hey do we understand our

768
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
risk and our vulnerabilities and our

769
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,520
architecture and our systems

770
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
but we also need to understand is the

771
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,760
motivations of our attackers why might

772
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
they target us and we have to be

773
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
considering and because we don't want to

774
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
just be like every good cyber security

775
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,000
presentation we want to be a great one

776
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,360
let's have two quotes

777
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
from sun tzu every battle is one before

778
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
it is fought so we should be stopping to

779
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
ask the questions to do tabletops and

780
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,159
ask ourselves hey is there a reason that

781
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,320
my organization might be targeted by a

782
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,399
nation state is there a geopolitical

783
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,000
motivation is there something that we're

784
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,279
involved in

785
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
are we supporting government activities

786
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
do we support and host that kind of data

787
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
are we doing research as an educational

788
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
institution on behalf of the government

789
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,480
or certainly on behalf of anything in

790
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
the military industrial complex

791
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
from a cyber criminal perspective okay

792
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,159
what are the systems for us that are

793
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
really about profit generation where can

794
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,960
we not afford to have an outage where

795
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
are the areas in our network where we

796
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
would genuinely pay ransom before we

797
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
would allow those systems to be taken

798
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,200
down and then you need to tabletop that

799
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,960
and play that out and really think that

800
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
through and how will you respond are the

801
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,799
right controls disaster recovery

802
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,120
protections incident response measures

803
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
are they in place are they tested do

804
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,640
they work

805
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
and you have to go through these and ask

806
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
the tough questions of your organization

807
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
about even things like activists is

808
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,919
there anything ideologically right are

809
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,039
you maybe

810
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,080
involved in hosting for a controversial

811
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,679
political figure that happened recently

812
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
for a cyber security company who is

813
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
involved in hosting and they happen to

814
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,039
host the website for somebody who was a

815
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,559
controversial political figure and the

816
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,640
entire company came under attack as a

817
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
result of that

818
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and that was a very significant activity

819
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
that they had to respond to that at a

820
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
time it didn't seem like they were truly

821
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,600
prepared for but if we go through and we

822
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,240
tabletop not just with the basic hey

823
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
we're dealing with a ransomware attack

824
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,000
hey we're dealing with a ddos attack hey

825
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
we're dealing with a malware outbreak of

826
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
some kind but if we go through and we

827
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,039
tabletop where we're truly looking at

828
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,520
who the adversary is and we're doing

829
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
adversary simulation and adversary

830
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
emulation we're saying okay what would

831
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,840
it look like if a nation state attacked

832
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
our organization why would they do it

833
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,159
what kinds of things would they be after

834
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,000
how would we respond how would we defend

835
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320
who do we involve if we ask those

836
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
questions with the right understanding

837
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,159
of motivations and evolutions of

838
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
attackers then we can actually get to a

839
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,880
measure of defense and readiness that

840
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
will keep us in a place where we

841
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,000
actually might be successful in some of

842
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
these activities

843
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
all right guys that is all i have for

844
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,919
you today i hope that a short run

845
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,679
through attacker history and motivations

846
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,480
was educational and valuable to you

847
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
i'll pause here if there are any

848
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,640
questions or anything that we want to

849
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
talk through or respond to

850
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
i'm happy to take those now

851
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,840
we have thoughts on why some countries

852
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
are embracing cryptos and others are

853
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,880
heavy-handed against it or not

854
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
um

855
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,480
i don't know that i have a

856
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,039
particular opinion on why i see or don't

857
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,840
see that i think in many ways it just

858
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,600
comes down to what are the existing

859
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
regulatory organizations in each

860
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
individual country and how that

861
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,640
regulatory organization decides they are

862
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,399
going to look at it i don't know if it's

863
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,120
necessarily cultural or you know as much

864
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,039
one country or the next as it is just

865
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,640
there's regulatory bodies like for

866
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
example the sec in the us may look at it

867
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,520
much differently than any other country

868
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,279
who also has their own stock market and

869
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,520
trading and things like that too as well

870
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
as we've seen the scc has has very much

871
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,360
struggled in how they want to handle and

872
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
deal with a cryptocurrency whether it is

873
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,000
or is not a security in and of itself

874
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,840
any other questions

875
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,159
um

876
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,360
do we have any experience with

877
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,679
ransomware negotiations unfortunately

878
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
yes

879
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,960
and how companies approach that while

880
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,679
still engaging with law enforcement

881
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,600
there are sound waves in which you can

882
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
engage in this with law enforcement when

883
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,240
you are and if you are especially if you

884
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
are obligated under regulatory

885
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,679
requirements

886
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,039
to report

887
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
and most of us are

888
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,039
and you should engage with law

889
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
enforcement if you have that kind of

890
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,600
attack because you do want it to be

891
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
properly investigated and hopefully

892
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,320
there's a possibility for prosecution to

893
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,960
get maybe some recompense for what

894
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,159
occurred um that being said um law

895
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,880
enforcement can advise against paying

896
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
that um that does not mean you have to

897
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
follow that advice there are many

898
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,279
organizations where law enforcement has

899
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,880
been involved and they have recommended

900
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,240
not paying and the organization

901
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
being the victim of the ransomware

902
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
attack has said it's actually more

903
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
important to our business to be back

904
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
online right now and pay this ransom as

905
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,880
compared to complying with this for the

906
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,799
sake of not giving in to this criminal

907
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,000
organization

908
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,640
um it does happen and and

909
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,120
pers on a personal level i will say

910
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,480
i'm never a fan of of seeing people pay

911
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,399
but i absolutely understand when some

912
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,720
businesses do it is a business risk

913
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
decision that's not just a moral or an

914
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
ethical decision at times which is how i

915
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,679
tend to look at it personally i i can

916
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
tend to be a little bit black and white

917
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,480
on some of those things

918
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,799
um this is i'm very opposed to cyber

919
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,279
criminal activity on a personal level um

920
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,120
but i do understand why some business is

921
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,480
paying and when you're talking about

922
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,159
losing hundreds of thousands of dollars

923
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
an hour for some businesses um you know

924
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
and if the ransom is you know a million

925
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
and a half dollars and you've been down

926
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,919
for three days while there's a point

927
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,919
where it's like just pay it and that's

928
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,279
that's what makes sense at this point

929
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,440
for the business i understand it

930
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
if i was a ceo i'd i'd probably be

931
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,799
pretty stubborn in that myself

932
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,200
but um hopefully i would also be the

933
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
kind of ceo that would enforce us to

934
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
have very good recovery backup

935
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
procedures and other things that would

936
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,760
protect us

937
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,399
i hope that answers the question and

938
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,159
clearly enough it is it's kind of an

939
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,000
ambiguous area right now as far as what

940
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,960
you should and should not do

941
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,559
any other questions guys happy to answer

942
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,960
anything else and if not

943
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,559
it's been a pleasure talking to you guys

944
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,200
and uh please feel free to to follow up

945
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,080
um

946
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
with any other questions you have i'm

947
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,559
sure we can get them routed to me if

948
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,519
they're they're not for public

949
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,760
consumption

950
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,919
yeah thanks jordan we have a couple more

951
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
coming in oh no we do right here at the

952
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,039
end okay

953
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,640
got a couple that came in

954
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
um are there not any international laws

955
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
against using cryptocurrency on the dark

956
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,600
web

957
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,559
um

958
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,240
there do not

959
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,840
there is not any regulation against it

960
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,720
cryptocurrency

961
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,799
there's no way to prove necessarily what

962
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
cryptocurrency is being used for or tie

963
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
it to a specific transaction um that's

964
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,919
that's the hard part is is it would be

965
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,000
illegal to pay for anything with any

966
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,399
type of currency if it was illegal right

967
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,880
to pay money for any legal service any

968
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
legal substance anything like that right

969
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,720
the exchange of dollars for that is part

970
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,039
of what makes it illegal um the problem

971
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,279
is then you have to tie that exchange of

972
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,360
currency to that particular illegal

973
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,120
activity and so when something is

974
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,560
happening on the dark web and it is

975
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
being paid for cryptocurrency the

976
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,079
cryptocurrency can be a completely

977
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,320
anonymous transaction that can't be

978
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
tracked back to the individual activity

979
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,639
right and may have no association with

980
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,918
it right the cyber criminal forum and

981
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,918
you know monero coin there's no tie

982
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,679
between those in any way shape or form

983
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
to say oh this is definitively how they

984
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,679
pay you to receive payment for this

985
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,239
particular criminal activity they did

986
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,639
very very hard to tie those things

987
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,399
together prove them and make that

988
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,839
something that would then hold up in

989
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,639
court um you might be able to intimidate

990
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,159
and get confession with that as a law

991
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,320
enforcement officer possibly but if you

992
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
were really to go to trial the defense

993
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,760
attorney would probably have a field day

994
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,599
with saying that this is strictly

995
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,280
circumstantial and you can't prove that

996
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
this is what this currency transaction

997
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,280
is for

998
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
what are some approaches or

999
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,079
opportunities that small medium

1000
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,240
businesses overlook in the cyber realm

1001
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
in terms of protections and preventions

1002
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
oh that this is a great question

1003
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,960
actually because i

1004
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,880
um i think there were a lot of things

1005
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,400
that are overlooked

1006
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,480
that are real easy wins for a lot of

1007
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
small medium business

1008
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
first and foremost turn on multi-factor

1009
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,400
authentication everywhere right the vast

1010
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
majority of compromise we see today

1011
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
happens with stolen credentials as the

1012
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
initial vector in

1013
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760
if we start with saying well we'll turn

1014
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,320
on multi-factor everywhere and then for

1015
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
any non-trusted device you're going to

1016
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,560
have to use multi-factor authentication

1017
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
and that reduces the attack surface for

1018
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,160
the user entity significantly

1019
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
if we can then combine that with

1020
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
something as simple as a good solid

1021
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,839
well-reputed endpoint technology which

1022
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,920
has edr involved and there are numerous

1023
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
of these out there

1024
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,839
palo alto cortex xdr crowdstrike

1025
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,760
sentinel one even microsoft's defender

1026
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,000
for endpoint that what was defender atp

1027
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,640
before these are great technologies um

1028
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,320
they do a phenomenally good job of

1029
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
giving giving visibility to security

1030
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,079
operations personnel and security

1031
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,599
engineers to what's actually happening

1032
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,960
on the endpoint

1033
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,720
those two things alone are huge the last

1034
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,640
one i would say is useful disc

1035
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,599
encryption

1036
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,480
use it everywhere use it well enforce it

1037
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,400
as a policy put everybody on

1038
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
company-owned devices and if you do

1039
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,240
those things

1040
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,440
you will

1041
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,599
jump start your cybersecurity program by

1042
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,119
leaps and bounds which is some very

1043
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,200
simple changes that will not cost a

1044
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,599
small and medium business so much money

1045
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,880
that it impacts the bottom line

1046
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
where do we see ransomware going next

1047
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,880
moving beyond holding data and exposing

1048
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,160
it if ransom is not paid that's a very

1049
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,520
interesting question

1050
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,359
um i think

1051
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,000
we've already seen some of this happen

1052
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,320
the colonial pipeline attack

1053
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,119
as well as the us farmers co-op um are

1054
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,880
two great examples of where we see this

1055
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,040
beginning to look at how do we go beyond

1056
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,680
just disrupting services or technology

1057
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,160
but to actually disrupting

1058
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,119
um disrupting entire regions disrupting

1059
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,560
oil distribution disrupting food

1060
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,839
distribution

1061
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
in ways that have tremendously large

1062
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
impact that forced payment in a scale

1063
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,200
that we have not seen before

1064
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,880
the other thing that we're also seeing

1065
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,440
is attackers becoming incredibly

1066
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,839
educated about the financial status of

1067
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,839
organizations having gone to public

1068
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
companies requesting ransom and when the

1069
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
public company says we don't have that

1070
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
kind of cash they're literally replying

1071
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,040
with their quarterly and saying well

1072
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
this says differently you definitely

1073
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,960
have this kind of cash pay us but also

1074
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,359
with that then making threats of well

1075
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,200
we're going to now align the timing of

1076
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,520
this ransomware attack also to when

1077
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,880
you're then having your quarterly

1078
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,359
shareholder call and then this is going

1079
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,480
to be something that's going to come out

1080
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
the same time and now as that's released

1081
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
and the stock analysts see this we're

1082
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
actually going to tank your stock price

1083
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,839
as a part of a ransomware attack too as

1084
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,359
well and now we're going to hit you

1085
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,560
where it really

1086
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
really hurts at the board and at the

1087
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,800
shareholders and you're going to pay us

1088
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,680
because of that and uh i have to say um

1089
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,599
i've been pretty impressed with some of

1090
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,800
the research so it's actually then you

1091
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
have you do have to learn to respect uh

1092
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
your adversaries and and some of these

1093
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,560
guys have done some incredibly good

1094
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,560
research

1095
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
um is there any effort to establish an

1096
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,320
international body or set of laws to

1097
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
deal with cyber crime across

1098
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
international boundaries actually yes um

1099
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,520
if you go look that that exact question

1100
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,280
up right now in google you'll see that

1101
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
there was about 30 nations that got

1102
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,839
together last week to have initial talks

1103
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,240
specifically about the broad spread

1104
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,920
ransomware problem

1105
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
i don't know where that will go it's a

1106
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,320
very challenging problem um but i think

1107
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,640
we see some good collaboration between

1108
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,280
the us and the eu right now to begin to

1109
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,119
try to push this problem forward the

1110
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,280
problem that we will have to then deal

1111
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
with is you know if we go to like six

1112
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
party talks and we look at kind of the

1113
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
six big nations of the world if you will

1114
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
i'm not everybody in a six-party talk

1115
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,880
right now

1116
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
would be an agreement on how we should

1117
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
handle this um and we're going to have

1118
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,079
to get fairly broad-spectrum buy-in

1119
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,520
to make this stop

1120
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,160
thoughts on quantum communication with

1121
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,440
regards to cyber security and

1122
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,960
information integrity could this be a

1123
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
promising technology for mitigating

1124
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
cyber attacks

1125
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,079
quantum technology is still in a very

1126
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,520
very very early phase it's a fascinating

1127
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,000
sector of tech i i do actually read

1128
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,040
quite a bit about it because i'm

1129
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,200
fascinated by the ideas and the

1130
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,400
potential um i don't know how far along

1131
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,480
we are the the practical applications

1132
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,680
that we've seen of quantum computing

1133
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,760
right now are very very limited um and i

1134
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
struggle and then just could be my my

1135
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,520
you know iq limitations maybe i struggle

1136
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,079
to see how it will be stretched to apply

1137
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,079
that more broadly to problems um outside

1138
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,640
of very specific mathematical based

1139
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,560
algorithms that that you can structure

1140
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
something in quantum computing to solve

1141
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
so there's limited applications and we

1142
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,119
look at that maybe for cryptography

1143
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,800
there's applications for quantum

1144
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,200
computing and in quantum cryptography

1145
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,440
but then applications for broad spectrum

1146
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
cyber security are more difficult

1147
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,800
because

1148
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,440
even if we try to improve data security

1149
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,280
but if we don't also then improve

1150
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
authentication and access control as a

1151
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
part of that well they'll just bypass

1152
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,800
that by using the things that are

1153
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,880
already authenticating to where the data

1154
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,960
is decrypted and available which is what

1155
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,200
we see right now we see

1156
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
systems that do have full disk encrypted

1157
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,119
encryption enabled in servers that are

1158
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,040
encrypting things and and but then we

1159
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,280
see attackers getting access to that and

1160
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,119
saying well it you may have had it

1161
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,640
encrypted but you're already logged in

1162
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,319
and you've already decrypted the system

1163
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,160
and now i have access to the data based

1164
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,200
on that

1165
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,720
and that becomes a problem in and of

1166
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
itself but then the other part of that

1167
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
is that doesn't fix the availability

1168
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,119
problem for us too as well right and so

1169
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,480
they can say well you may have this

1170
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,560
encrypted that's nice i'll take the

1171
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
entire thing wrap it in another box of

1172
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,319
encrypted encryption and lock you out

1173
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,359
from it

1174
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,520
and now you're unavailable so it doesn't

1175
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,599
matter i didn't need to decrypt it what

1176
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,280
i needed to do was stop it from being

1177
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,200
available so it may help with

1178
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
information leaks but it would not help

1179
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,000
from service disruption and availability

1180
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,599
and then potential revenue loss as a

1181
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,240
result of that so um i will we'll wait

1182
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,839
to see how it plays out i think it's

1183
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,319
quantum is is fairly early um i'm

1184
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,480
fascinated by the topic um and i look

1185
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
forward to some of the innovation that

1186
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
could come from it who knows maybe

1187
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,640
there'll be some great breakthroughs

1188
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,240
right now i still think it's fairly

1189
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,040
limited in scope

1190
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,560
all right i don't see

1191
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,440
any other questions that have come in so

1192
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,760
that being said guys um it has been an

1193
