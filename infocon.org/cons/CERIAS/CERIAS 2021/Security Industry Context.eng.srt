00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,760
weekly

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,279
security seminars and this week i'm

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,719
uh really really pleased

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,759
to introduce carolyn wong

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,320
she's the chief strategy officer at

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,680
cobalt

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,400
cobalt is a firm that does pen testing

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,199
and

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
other security kinds of activities and

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
she manages

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,760
several aspects of what cobalt does and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,279
chief strategy officer i don't know if

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
that's something you're going to mention

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
it's a different kind of cso that some

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,079
of us

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,399
may not have encountered but she brings

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,440
to that a

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,920
a real wealth of experience with having

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
had director positions

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
at symantec um and

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
uh working at digital

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
ebay she's written a book that has

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,440
gotten some very good reviews i i like

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,239
it as

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,480
something that i also referred to uh

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
it's entitled security metrics a

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
beginner's guide

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
and she is going to be sharing with us

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
some of her experience in

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
a presentation with a fascinating title

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,479
come for the mission

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,720
and stay for the culture and stay for

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,680
carolyn's talk

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,240
so carolyn take it away please staff

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
thank you so much for the warm welcome

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,000
um i have a surprise i told

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
berkey and i think mike may have been on

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,200
the line

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
when uh i shared the surprise

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
so here's the thing spaff contacted me

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
to join for the seminar series in august

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
of last year

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
and i was thrilled and i said you know

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
where do i sign up how do i get involved

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
and he said well we've got this calendar

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
and i looked

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
and the next sort of reasonable time was

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,479
in february which is today

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,880
and so at that time i thought to myself

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,159
well what should i talk about

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,960
i will present my most recent talk which

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,159
is come for the mission stay for the

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
culture and as fafsa was saying

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,119
in my role as chief strategy officer it

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,640
is a different

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
cso role i actually oversee

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
security and i.t as well as human

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,840
resources

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
as well as what we call community at

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
cobalt so we consider these to all be

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
strategic functions and come for the

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
mission stay for the culture

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
is all about people and culture

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
and security and here's the thing about

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,879
that talk

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
it is recorded it is online if you would

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
like to see that talk

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
you're welcome to google it and check it

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
out and then talk to me about it after i

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
would love to talk with you about that

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
talk

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
but i was i was thinking about it for

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
today i thought to myself you know what

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,959
this talk is number one out of date

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
and number two it's already available so

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
if anyone wants to see it

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
you can what i'd love to do actually is

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
share with you a brand new talk that

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,879
i've never

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
shared publicly before um i thought that

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
uh this might be a group that might

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
find it to be interesting and certainly

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
i look very forward

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
to questions that arise

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
because of it now it is such a new talk

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,940
that i don't have a cool title

88
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,400
[Laughter]

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
and so right now we're calling it

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
security industry context

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
um basically what i'm gonna do i'm gonna

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,920
talk about

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,840
five interwoven themes today number one

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,400
modern software and internet security is

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
not a zero-sum game

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,040
number two the hardest problems to solve

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,680
in security are not technical

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,799
number three the most powerful solutions

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,400
that are required to address

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
cybersecurity problems today will

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,480
require

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
people and process innovation number

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,239
four

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
cyber security has many different facets

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
and it can seem complicated

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
but it is not impossibly complex there

107
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
are fundamentals that we

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
as an industry can rely on and we should

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
not allow ourselves to get too caught up

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
in the myth

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
that these problems are too hard to

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,480
solve

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
and theme number five protecting the

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,519
world's digital value

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
is not just something that is the job of

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
security professionals or frankly

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
just the job of software developers

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
cyber security has always been an

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,079
outcome

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
a result of the behaviors and

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
interactions and decisions and actions

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,240
of

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
many different people this has never

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
been more true than it is today

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
and i believe that we really are all in

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,320
this together

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
my hope is that by presenting these

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
observations to you

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
that as you go throughout your lives and

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,919
careers

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
making decisions and solving problems

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
and making these things happen

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
that these themes might be something

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
that you can draw upon for inspiration

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
i do expect of course that these themes

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,280
will continue to evolve

137
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
but when i ask myself why am i in

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
the cyber security industry why do i

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
stay in the industry why do i love this

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
industry

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
these are actually some of the answers

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,199
that i have today so

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,120
um a surprise

144
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
okay thing number one it's not a

145
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
zero-sum game

146
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
first and foremost security is about

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
protecting value

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
in today's modern world a lot of the

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,039
things that we value

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,520
are shifting from the physical realm to

151
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,560
the digital realm

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,080
and that's why cyber security is so

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
important

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,400
security practitioners used to have this

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
story that they would tell

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
about how to think about cyber security

157
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,400
the story says that if spaff and i are

158
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
running away from a bear

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,639
i don't have to outrun the bear i just

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
have to run faster than staff

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
in this scenario the underlying

162
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
assumption is that i value myself

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
and that i don't value staff my success

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,919
does not depend on staff and so as long

165
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
as i get away from the bear

166
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,759
it doesn't matter to me if the bear

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
becomes

168
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
if the if staff becomes the bear's lunch

169
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
the problem with this analogy of course

170
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
is that

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
well there's many problems with this

172
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,400
analogy one problem with this analogy is

173
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,680
that in reality

174
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
software companies and the digital value

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,199
that is created

176
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
by organizations that doesn't happen in

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
a vacuum

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
we are not independent islands

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,759
i actually think that a more appropriate

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
analogy for how things work in cyber

181
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,720
security

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
would be a three-legged race because in

183
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
a three-legged race my partner and i

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
are dependent upon each other and in

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,960
order to win

186
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,919
we have to work together in lockstep i

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,960
really think this is

188
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
more of how it is today when it comes to

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
software security

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
every software company including the

191
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
company that i currently work for

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
is part of a tightly interwoven

193
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
ecosystem of software companies

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
that provide a variety of products and

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
services

196
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
each of these companies their software

197
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
to help them do

198
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,360
happened to me on monday january 4

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
that i woke up next to my daughter on

200
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,759
the bottom bunk of her bunk bed

201
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,960
and i looked at my phone my internet is

202
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
now unstable

203
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
uh okay i hope i'm back if there was

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,560
any uh lag hopefully it wasn't a big

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,199
deal

206
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
i'm back i'm gonna start over for this

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
slide

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
a perfect example of this dependency

209
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,240
between software companies

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,520
happened on monday january 4th

211
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
that morning i woke up next to my

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
five-year-old daughter on the bottom

213
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,840
bunk of her bunk bed and i looked at my

214
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,520
phone it was my first day back at work

215
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
after a two-week vacation

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
and i had received this text message

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
from my colleague

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
it turns out that slack was down the

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
outage lasted about six hours or so

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
including a significant impact on the

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
precious hours where

222
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
at my company we have folks all over the

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
united states

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
we have a lot of folks in berlin germany

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
and folks all over the world but mostly

226
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
it's the us and germany and so we have

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
these sort of like

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
precious hours in what is my morning

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
being on the west coast

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
where there's overlap between working

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
hours in

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,960
san francisco and berlin so this was

233
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
this was a startling way to start the

234
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,479
first

235
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,240
working day of the new year for me

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,679
so at the company that i work for

237
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,958
we're about 150 people uh we've built

238
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,640
a solid business uh today we serve

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
more than 750 customers and we use 65 or

240
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
so vendors

241
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
you can think about our software company

242
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
like a tree

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
the vendors we rely on are like the

244
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,680
roots of the tree and the customers are

245
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
like the branches

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
and of course if all goes well those

247
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
branches will bear fruit

248
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
year after year um i mentioned

249
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
waking up in uh my five-year-old

250
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,680
daughter's bunk bed

251
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
i do have two young kids and we watch a

252
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,839
lot of disney movies in our house

253
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,320
as i was thinking about putting this

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
presentation together i couldn't help

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,640
but

256
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
think of this particular song lyric from

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
the disney movie pocahontas

258
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
and we are all connected to each other

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
in a circle in a hoop that

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
never ends because i think that's how it

261
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
is today with modern software companies

262
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
and that means that security is not

263
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
something that we can care about

264
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,120
in silos we must acknowledge the

265
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
dependencies that we have on

266
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
other software organizations for the

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
state of our security

268
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
it is no longer enough to just care

269
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,519
about the security of your own

270
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
because your vendors insecurity your

271
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
partners in security

272
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,640
these things affect your risk profile

273
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
and your ability to protect

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
the value that you create

275
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
the next theme i want to talk about is

276
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
the fact that

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,240
i actually don't believe that the

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
hardest problems to solve in cyber

279
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,120
security are technical

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
i am uh as you may or may not know the

281
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
linkedin learning instructor

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,839
for the master the owasp top 10 learning

283
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,120
path

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
something uh about me before i started

285
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
creating the content for these

286
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
instructional videos

287
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,760
i actually didn't have a very deep

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
understanding of what the top 10

289
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
was all about the first version

290
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,079
of the owasp top 10 came out in 2003

291
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
and i started my cyber security career

292
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
in 2005.

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,839
i became the chief of staff to the

294
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,959
global information security team at ebay

295
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,200
and naturally since ebay is an online

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,079
marketplace

297
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
that allows strangers to buy and sell

298
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
from each other over the internet

299
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
web application security was and is of

300
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
extremely high importance

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
the problem for me was that every once

302
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,120
in a while

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,440
i would try to download the oauth top 10

304
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
document

305
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
and i would try to read it but i would

306
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,279
get stuck

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,680
i would get bored i would get confused

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
or something more urgent would come up

309
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
and i would put it down

310
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,000
so i never really learned the owasp top

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,880
10

312
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
until a few years ago when i had to

313
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,839
teach it to other people

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,560
the current version of the oauth top 10

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
was released in 2017

316
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
and the crazy thing about it is that

317
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,120
despite having been

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
through several iterations over the past

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
17 years

320
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
the types of issues found in web

321
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
applications is pretty much the same

322
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
it is the same stuff that the best and

323
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
the brightest in our industry

324
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
have been talking about for 17 years

325
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
why haven't these problems been fixed we

326
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,040
know how to find them

327
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,240
we know how to fix them and we know how

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:11,839
to prevent them

329
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
so a special thanks to travis mccormick

330
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
on the cobalt team uh for making this

331
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
happen

332
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,639
okay so my internet is unstable again

333
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,160
okay hopefully i'm back i got another

334
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
thing saying internet is unstable but

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
that has disappeared hopefully i'm back

336
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
the next thing i want to talk about is

337
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
this common misconception

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
that the biggest and the baddest

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
problems thank you smash

340
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
in software security are technical

341
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
problems

342
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,920
let's talk about the 2017 equifax breach

343
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
more than 140 million people affected

344
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
a widely accepted theory that the

345
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
attackers were state-sponsored spies

346
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,160
from china

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
a ceo who stepped down three weeks after

348
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,079
the breach became public

349
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,040
1.4 billion dollars to clean up the mess

350
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,079
and an ftc

351
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
settlement how did this breach happen

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
it was not because of a super

353
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,839
sophisticated

354
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
zero-day technical issue it was because

355
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,120
some software was found to be vulnerable

356
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,000
a patch was made available and equifax

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
did not deploy the patch

358
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,200
this was not a crazy technical problem

359
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
that lacked a solution

360
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
the technical solution was available

361
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
this was a lack of people and process

362
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
innovation

363
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
more recently threat actors managed to

364
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,279
plant

365
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
malware and some monitoring software

366
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,240
which happened to be in use by some

367
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,839
250 or plus organizations bunches of

368
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,519
organizations when the news first broke

369
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,680
the breach was described as a highly

370
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
sophisticated

371
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,519
targeted and manual supply chain attack

372
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:55,920
by an

373
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,120
outside nation state that sounds really

374
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,680
intense

375
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,279
and it is but when you draw back the

376
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,680
curtain

377
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
it's possible that they had used the

378
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,279
password

379
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,800
solarwinds123 to quote unquote

380
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,399
protect the company's update server

381
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
if this was indeed the case it's no

382
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
wonder malicious threat actors took

383
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,199
advantage

384
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,160
and planted some malware this is

385
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,199
unfortunately

386
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,800
a simple security misconfiguration

387
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,279
the company i work for we make this

388
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
state of pen testing report

389
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
in last year state of penn testing

390
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
report my colleague vanessa soder and i

391
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
reported that misconfiguration was the

392
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,160
number one most

393
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
commonly identified vulnerability type

394
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,639
found across

395
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
thousands of pen tests done by cobalt

396
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,959
for the fourth year in a row

397
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
theme number four cyber security has

398
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,959
many different facets

399
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,600
and it can seem complicated but it is

400
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,000
not

401
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
impossibly complex there are

402
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,760
fundamentals that

403
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,480
we as industry professionals can rely on

404
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
and we should not allow ourselves to get

405
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
too caught up in the myth

406
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
that these problems are too hard to

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
solve

408
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
in 2005 as a new college grad i started

409
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
my first ever full-time job

410
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
as an information security engineer at

411
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
ebay

412
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,920
i was handed a 50-page stack of

413
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
information security policies

414
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
and told that i was responsible for

415
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
answering questions about it

416
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
from technology teams and from the

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
business

418
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,360
it was overwhelming i thought to myself

419
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,959
how am i ever going to learn all of this

420
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,000
stuff it seems so complex

421
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
i found out that after a few months by

422
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
meeting with people who had questions

423
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
about ebay security policy writing them

424
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,759
down

425
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
asking my manager going back to the

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,199
person to share with them

427
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,000
my newly acquired answer i found out

428
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
that people were asking the same

429
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,240
questions

430
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
over and over again throughout my career

431
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
i've been on two security teams as a

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
practitioner

433
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
i've led a global product management

434
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
team i've done consulting

435
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
and at cobalt this is my first startup

436
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
experience

437
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,839
this series of diverse experiences has

438
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
helped me to see that cyber security is

439
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,279
really complicated

440
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,600
but it is not impossibly complex

441
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
nist 853 is nist

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
853 is nearly 500 pages long

443
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
pci dss is more than 130 pages long

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,560
the bsim is more than 100 pages long

445
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,199
asvs is more than 60 pages long

446
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
i really think that the fundamental

447
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
principles of cyber security

448
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
and application security for that matter

449
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
can be boiled down to four basic

450
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,800
building blocks

451
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
a couple of years ago a few of my

452
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,040
colleagues and i worked on a white paper

453
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
called a practitioner's guide to

454
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,880
application security

455
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
it is a 20-page document that outlines

456
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,279
how simple

457
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,119
not easy but simple application security

458
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
can be

459
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,000
it includes a one-page poster that we

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,959
call the modern

461
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
application security framework the

462
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,839
framework has just four components

463
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,280
number one govern

464
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,119
aka know your assets number two find

465
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,399
number three fix and number four prevent

466
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,520
recently in cyber security land there

467
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
has been a lot of emphasis

468
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
on automation this storyline says that

469
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
because we have a lot of cyber security

470
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,280
problems

471
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
and we also have a talent shortage you

472
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
should try to automate as much as

473
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
possible so that you are less dependent

474
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,120
on people

475
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
i happen to strongly disagree that

476
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
automation can solve all of the world's

477
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,760
cyber security problems as my colleague

478
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
vanessa sotter eloquently shared in her

479
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
b-sides presentation last year

480
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,919
there are entire classes of security

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,720
vulnerabilities

482
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
that can only be discovered by humans

483
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
finding things like race conditions

484
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
business logic flaws and chained

485
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,840
exploits

486
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,200
cannot be automated we need things like

487
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
human creativity

488
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
human innovation human judgment human

489
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
opinions and human decisions

490
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,679
to drive the right outcomes in this

491
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
industry

492
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
it is true that software is being

493
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
developed faster and faster

494
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,039
and some cyber security teams are using

495
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,480
automation to manage some of the

496
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
incredible volume of work

497
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,600
that they're trying to tackle however

498
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
i think that solving the most important

499
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
cyber security problems

500
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,559
must include both automation as well as

501
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
manual effort um i'm really excited to

502
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,280
be

503
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
at cobalt because i think that what

504
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
we're trying to do is

505
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
change an industry when it comes to

506
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
innovating

507
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
on people and on process

508
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
security practitioners need a better

509
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,720
model for talent distribution

510
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
they need standardized automated

511
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
workflows that can take the friction

512
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
out of working cross-functionally

513
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
between security and engineering teams

514
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
to find and fix security issues

515
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
the next section is a little bit

516
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
tongue-in-cheek so i'll just give you a

517
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
heads up

518
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
consider for a moment the following

519
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,240
hypothetical scenario

520
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
imagine that we're in the midst of a

521
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,280
global pandemic

522
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
and a highly infectious deadly virus is

523
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,120
affecting millions of people around the

524
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,760
world

525
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
it is so bad that in the world's richest

526
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,880
country

527
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
more than 500 000 people have already

528
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
died from this disease

529
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,080
if you think it's a technical problem

530
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,679
then you might think the most important

531
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,039
thing to do is to develop

532
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,799
a vaccine that is a super hard

533
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
scientific problem to solve and it's the

534
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,160
scientists job to figure out

535
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
what happens when an effective vaccine

536
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,000
is created

537
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
the technical issue has been solved so

538
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
does the problem just disappear

539
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
of course not in some ways it might

540
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,200
actually be easier to invent a

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
completely new vaccine

542
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
than it is to figure out how to do

543
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
procurement and distribution and

544
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
communication

545
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,080
and actually get people vaccinated

546
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,840
just as we know the owasp top 10 and

547
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,240
we've

548
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
known the most common vulnerabilities

549
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,039
in web apps for 20 years

550
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
it doesn't mean that we can eliminate

551
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
and forget about these types of problems

552
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
just because you have a vaccine or three

553
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
doesn't mean that you can vaccinate

554
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
enough people to eliminate and forget

555
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,760
about

556
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,879
a global pandemic

557
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,080
so the next section um

558
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,559
it's a little bit it's an analogy

559
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,400
um and i actually

560
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
i have this idea i have this

561
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
hypothesis that maybe

562
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
the information security industry

563
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,159
doesn't have a talent shortage

564
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
maybe we have a control and a

565
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,840
distribution problem

566
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,600
um to illustrate this point i present

567
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
the story of oliver twist

568
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
in this story nine-year-old oliver is

569
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,120
living in a workhouse

570
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
where the kids are given three meals of

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
thin gruel a day

572
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
with an onion twice a week and half a

573
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,880
roll on sundays it is barely enough to

574
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,559
survive but it is certainly

575
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,039
not enough to thrive a well-fed

576
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,480
nine-year-old boy might grow

577
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
strong and capable and that's not what

578
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
the workhouse wants and needs

579
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,159
for bumble his objective is to keep the

580
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
kids alive

581
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,039
but still weak and subservient

582
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,159
take a look at this image bumble

583
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,919
is standing in front of a huge vat of

584
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
soup he controls the ladle and

585
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,159
therefore the boys in the room don't

586
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,240
have enough to eat

587
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,799
the problem here is not that there is

588
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,960
not enough food to go around

589
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
it's a problem of control and of

590
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,159
distribution

591
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,720
i want to begin to tie things up this is

592
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
turning out to be kind of a short talk

593
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
which i think is fine hopefully we'll

594
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
have a bunch to talk about afterwards

595
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,039
um i do think we're all in this together

596
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,880
like i said cyber security is an outcome

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,520
it happens as a result of the

598
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
interactions and the decisions that a

599
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
lot of different people make

600
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,799
and we can't just be looking out for

601
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,760
ourselves

602
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
and running away from the bear and not

603
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
caring

604
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
about our friends who are running with

605
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,559
us um

606
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
and so here is a picture from high

607
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
school musical

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,760
um you know one of the things that

609
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
the company that i work for is trying to

610
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
do we're a pentest company

611
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
we're trying to disrupt old school

612
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,000
legacy pen testing which historically

613
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
has been pen testing delivered by

614
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,760
consulting firms

615
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
it's kind of like big projects

616
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,400
custom projects expensive projects

617
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720
and what we're trying to do we're trying

618
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,840
to do

619
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
on-demand manual pen testing

620
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
i really don't want this to turn into a

621
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
sales pitch i really want it to just be

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,919
about thought leadership so i'm going to

623
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
go to my analogy which says

624
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
when i was in college i took a dance

625
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
choreography class

626
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
i was i was in a class with perhaps 20

627
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,600
other students

628
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
uh and and throughout a semester i

629
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
choreographed the dance

630
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
and at the end of the semester we

631
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,559
performed it and it was like three

632
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
minutes long

633
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
now a very good friend of mine in

634
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,679
college

635
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
played basketball and we would go to the

636
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
gym together and i would go

637
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
run on the treadmill and and and my

638
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
friend would play basketball he would

639
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,080
just play pickup basketball

640
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,640
and i thought it was so cool that he

641
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
could just

642
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,320
show up basketball in hand

643
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,600
and just join a game with you know 10

644
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
people that he'd never met before and

645
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
because the rules are defined

646
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,679
they can just play and they can just

647
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,080
play immediately and i think this

648
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,919
type of structured

649
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,279
workflow and protocol where we

650
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,960
know how to work together where the

651
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
rules are set where we can just engage

652
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,480
on demand immediately and just have fun

653
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
without having to think about it and

654
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,919
plan and plan and plan for a semester

655
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,360
before we get to do this thing for three

656
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,480
minutes together

657
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,440
um that is that's something that i think

658
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,159
would be cool

659
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
so now i'm gonna i'm gonna do something

660
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,200
weird

661
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,440
and i'm gonna as a closer i'm going to

662
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
read you

663
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
some lyrics from the movie high school

664
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
musical

665
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,120
uh and then i'd love to ask you know

666
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,799
hear your questions and comments

667
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
uh together together together everyone

668
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
together together come on let's have

669
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,600
some fun

670
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
together we're there for each other

671
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,679
every time together together come on

672
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
let's do this right here and now it's

673
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,039
time for celebration i

674
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,039
finally figured it out that all our

675
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,799
dreams have no limitations

676
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
that's what it's all about everyone is

677
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
special in their own way

678
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
we make each other strong we're not the

679
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,279
same we're

680
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
different in a good way together is

681
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
where we belong

682
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,159
and that's that that's all i've got um

683
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,840
what i've got here is my email address

684
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,480
um i hope that we'll have some talking

685
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,320
here and now um and i i encourage folks

686
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,919
i'd love to connect with you

687
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
uh afterwards about any of the topics we

688
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,400
talked about today

689
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
um and anything else so

690
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
that's all i've got in terms of prepared

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,080
material

692
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,679
okay so um this is an opportunity

693
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
for you to ask some questions of

694
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
somebody with experience across a number

695
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,120
of companies

696
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
but also supervising people who may be

697
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,200
out in their first

698
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,480
security job doesn't have to be first

699
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,919
but it could be one

700
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,000
so what are your questions about what

701
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,559
that's like

702
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,159
i know you're out there i see at least

703
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,880
23 of you in the audience

704
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,960
oh how sweet so the question says your

705
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,039
passion for the cyber security field is

706
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,039
extremely clear what makes you love the

707
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,400
field so much

708
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,440
um thank you uh for that observation

709
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,720
i ended up in cyber security

710
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
not on purpose um i grew up in san

711
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
francisco

712
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,600
my parents are chinese immigrants um and

713
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,440
i grew up in the type of house where

714
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
you do what dad tells you to do and what

715
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
my dad told me to do

716
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
was he told me to study electrical

717
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,000
engineering and computer science

718
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,279
at the very best school that i could get

719
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,919
myself into and so i went to uc berkeley

720
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,600
and i studied eeks

721
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
and afterwards i looked for a job

722
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,840
between my junior and senior year i

723
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,320
i thought to myself okay i need an

724
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,279
internship

725
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,600
uh i applied for like 40 or 50

726
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,480
internships

727
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
and the one that ended up working out

728
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,600
was it ebay

729
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
i took an it product uh it project

730
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,559
management role not a security rule

731
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,720
but when i graduated from college i went

732
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,480
back to my internship manager and i said

733
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,200
hey

734
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,360
i've graduated i'd love to work on this

735
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
team full-time

736
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,120
and he said um we'd love to have you but

737
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
there's a hiring freeze in i.t

738
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
we can't hire you right now um but you

739
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
should know that there

740
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
are a couple of entry-level positions

741
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
over on the information security team

742
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,120
and that was you know whatever it is 16

743
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,919
years ago so

744
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
so the rest is kind of history why do i

745
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,760
love this field

746
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,159
i love the field because of the people

747
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,760
in the field

748
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
i get to meet and interact with and work

749
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
with some of the most

750
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
interesting smart people that i've ever

751
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,679
known and i just love that

752
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,200
i also i also like solving interesting

753
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
and hard problems

754
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,279
and i think there's no shortage of those

755
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,120
so yeah thank you so much

756
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,840
for the kind question i actually host a

757
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
podcast

758
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,880
called humans of infosec that might be

759
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,559
particularly interesting for a lot of

760
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,600
the folks here

761
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,679
what i do on that podcast staff we got

762
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,039
to have you on the podcast

763
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,480
uh is i talk to people about their work

764
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
and their career uh and i i like to ask

765
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,000
people about

766
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
sort of their career stories you know

767
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,159
how did they get from

768
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,080
wherever they started to where they are

769
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
today um

770
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
one of the underlying themes of that

771
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,799
podcast a couple of the underlying

772
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,520
themes

773
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,559
one thing is that everyone's story is

774
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,679
totally different

775
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120
for the most part and another one uh

776
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
is that um everyone

777
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
started not knowing anything at one

778
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,120
point in time

779
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
everyone at one point in time didn't

780
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
know anything about cyber security

781
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,399
even the very top experts in the field

782
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,720
um so if you're interested check it out

783
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
humans of infosec

784
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,600
um yes uh there's another question

785
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
from brooke there's a school of thought

786
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
that artificial intelligence

787
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,559
based products will replace a large

788
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,320
number of security professionals

789
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,000
you mentioned that it is you believe it

790
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
is a mix between tools and people

791
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
and people can't be replaced completely

792
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
but you but do you believe that tools on

793
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
automated solutions

794
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,200
will eventually grow to be more

795
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,559
prevalent than actual human

796
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,880
professionals

797
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,840
so this is a super interesting question

798
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,480
i think that

799
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,840
they're just needed for different things

800
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,600
even fancy a

801
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,399
i and ml on some level

802
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,679
is following instructions in code

803
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,240
that a human told it to do at one point

804
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
in time

805
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,760
we've got

806
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,919
bunches of data and we have historical

807
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,039
information

808
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,360
and we can put all that information into

809
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,559
a machine and it can spit something out

810
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,000
i think that i've learned about this

811
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,320
concept called um oh gosh

812
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,799
something drift pattern drift data drift

813
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,240
i can look it up after

814
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,320
there's some sort of drift concept and

815
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,200
the idea simply is that

816
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,120
whatever data set you're working with

817
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,760
it's sort of never going to match

818
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,039
exactly

819
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,520
the current situation that you have and

820
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,159
so

821
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
whatever it spits out as a result is

822
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,799
never going to be exactly right

823
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,399
i think that machines are super good at

824
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,080
doing things like

825
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
good at doing things that are well

826
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,919
defined that are repeatable

827
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
um and there's lots of that kind of

828
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,840
stuff in infosec

829
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
um but there's also a lot of um

830
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,039
there's also still going to be

831
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,080
a human touch that's needed uh i i

832
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,840
recently commented

833
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,519
um in an article uh where

834
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
someone was writing about the recent

835
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,279
clubhouse attacks

836
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,039
uh breach if you will and

837
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,559
based on the little that i know about it

838
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,159
my interpretation was that the attacker

839
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,440
had used a business logic attack to i

840
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,000
think like

841
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
listen into a clubhouse chat and then

842
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
like publish it or something like that

843
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,480
um now a business logic attack is not

844
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,200
something

845
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,720
to my knowledge that today we have

846
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,080
software and machines uh to help us find

847
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,840
we actually need people to say hmm

848
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
maybe we should conduct a threat model

849
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,159
that's a human

850
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,880
manual activity that's not a scanner you

851
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
know that's not uh

852
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,399
that's not a configuration assessment

853
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,519
tool

854
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,080
um maybe we should consider misuse and

855
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,120
abuse cases

856
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,519
you know here's like the good path for

857
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
the way we want and think these features

858
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,840
are going to use

859
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,399
you know but how much someone malicious

860
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,200
twist it

861
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,159
and use it for different purposes um so

862
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,559
so

863
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,919
so i think it's a it's a super

864
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
interesting question um and

865
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,640
and would love to uh would love to talk

866
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,080
on it further thank you for the question

867
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,880
brokay

868
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
um there's there's one that says there's

869
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
a couple about owasp actually

870
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,760
one person asks can you elaborate on

871
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
what owasp is

872
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,240
excellent question owasp stands for open

873
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,760
web application security project

874
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,640
it's basically like a do-gooder

875
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
non-profit of people

876
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,039
who like want to make application

877
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,799
security and software security better

878
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,919
for the world

879
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,640
uh they have conferences they have white

880
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,760
papers they have

881
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,360
tools they do all sorts of cool things

882
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,480
the owasp top 10 is one of their

883
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,519
more popular more more known

884
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,159
projects and the intent simply was to

885
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,440
say

886
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,120
hey let's make a list of common web

887
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,960
applications security vulnerabilities

888
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,640
and then share that information with the

889
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,480
world it's really intended

890
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,039
as an awareness initiative

891
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,360
and uh there's another question about

892
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,640
owasp top ten

893
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
have you considered the relative nature

894
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,399
of owasp top ten

895
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,559
and that keeping the same relative order

896
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,799
in no way expresses absolute values it

897
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
shows us that the relative order has not

898
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
changed significantly but of course that

899
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,480
is to be expected as we use the same

900
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,360
fundamental technologies

901
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,519
so

902
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
i'm not sure i totally understand the

903
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
question but i'm going to interpret it

904
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,760
and in my own words and then perhaps you

905
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
can tell me

906
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,440
um if i'm interpreting this correctly so

907
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,000
what i'm

908
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,159
understanding is hey caroline

909
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
we've got a wasp top 10. there's an

910
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,639
order you know i don't i don't i'm not

911
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:10,960
sure

912
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,159
honestly if the idea is that like number

913
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,520
10

914
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
is like the 10th most common number one

915
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
is the first most common as far as i'm

916
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
concerned it's like

917
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
here's ten they're common um that being

918
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,960
said

919
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,839
um certainly problems like

920
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,960
access control sensitive data exposure

921
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
you know these one could say that these

922
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,879
are like sufficiently generic

923
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,560
sufficiently broad

924
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,960
that maybe yesterday it was applicable

925
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,679
in

926
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,320
technology a and today maybe we've moved

927
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
away from technology a and figured it

928
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,719
out but now

929
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,599
we see a similar problem happening uh in

930
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,639
technology b

931
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,839
so uh krasamir perhaps uh i don't know

932
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,040
if that's useful or not

933
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,480
i i welcome yes i can hello

934
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,880
okay cool so uh hey uh thank you for the

935
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
presentation so let me clarify let's

936
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,240
assume that number 11

937
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,440
is alien invasion

938
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
assuming right sure and make a

939
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,800
little bit of logic experiment so no

940
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,680
matter how much

941
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,480
we improve cross-site scripting or we

942
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,520
improve

943
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
uh for example buffer overflows and so

944
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
on

945
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,280
they at some point maybe will drop to

946
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,760
number 11 and alien invasion will become

947
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,240
number 10 on number nine

948
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
well the problem then is that we're

949
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,359
going to

950
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,079
spend time dealing with alien invasion

951
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,760
which is going to make it less of a

952
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,240
problem

953
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,000
which is going to make it drop down

954
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
again

955
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,920
let this thing come back in the top

956
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,320
again so basically

957
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,599
if we were let's say if injection was uh

958
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,400
at value five and we were defending at

959
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,839
value four we had one

960
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,240
delta delta one which means that yeah we

961
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,359
were failing at that

962
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,079
and this is why it was like a problem we

963
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,320
may increase our defenses from four to

964
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,119
eight

965
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
but then at the same time we're going to

966
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
be increasing defenses across the entire

967
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,079
spectrum because we're dealing with

968
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,359
always the weakest things

969
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
we put more pressure there but then the

970
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,440
attackers and the attacks will also

971
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,079
increase

972
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,560
and maybe when we're at defense eight

973
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
we're going to have attackers that are

974
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
going to beat us with

975
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,160
uh skill level 8.1

976
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,440
8.1 difference but still relatively

977
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,200
compared to the other differences it

978
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
will still end up there so i don't think

979
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,359
that

980
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,720
uh that looking retrospectively at all

981
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,440
asp

982
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,960
uh one first os is highly subjective for

983
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,440
one

984
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
but then just looking at the difference

985
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,200
over years does not um

986
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,800
really give us uh any information uh

987
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,680
for what is encoded there it at the best

988
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
we can get information

989
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,640
oh we're seeing a little bit more uh sql

990
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
now or we're seeing a little bit less

991
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,800
sql injection but then we can say well

992
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,680
maybe we're seeing

993
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
less sql injection not because we solved

994
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
the problem but because now people are

995
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,320
using mostly

996
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,920
um uh no skill which then leads us also

997
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
to base rate of attacks

998
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,040
uh so that's you know another can of

999
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
worms but that's what i wanted to say

1000
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
about the

1001
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,280
absolute level uh versus a relative

1002
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,119
level we really we really can't use that

1003
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,079
to make that judgment

1004
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,119
so crasmere i really like the way that

1005
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,560
you're thinking

1006
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,680
and i have a few thoughts in response

1007
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
um thought number one i think you're

1008
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
absolutely correct

1009
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,200
that the owasp top 10 is very subjective

1010
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
and so i so i think with something as

1011
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,320
subjective

1012
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,440
and as imprecise and as inaccurate as

1013
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
the owasp top 10

1014
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,240
it might be

1015
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,119
it might not be relevant to say well

1016
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,720
we're doing such a good job fighting

1017
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,839
number one

1018
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,599
that you know number two goes to the

1019
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
back of the line i kind of don't i kind

1020
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,480
of don't

1021
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
i kind of don't think it's a precise or

1022
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,839
an accurate enough

1023
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,000
model uh to assume those sort of things

1024
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,839
i think it's much

1025
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,880
cloudier than that you know that's my

1026
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
point

1027
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,240
yes okay so good so good so then let me

1028
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,079
let me say this crasmere

1029
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,119
uh and i am like not really a car

1030
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,440
person you all are in indiana so i think

1031
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,960
there's like this big car culture

1032
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,599
my husband grew up in indiana my my

1033
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,280
mother-in-law and my father-in-law

1034
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,520
are both graduates of purdue university

1035
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
um anyway

1036
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,320
my expectation is that if i looked at

1037
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
the statistics

1038
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,800
from like when people in the united

1039
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,680
states

1040
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,880
switched from using horses to using cars

1041
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,599
and then if i look at when seat belts

1042
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,320
were made

1043
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
and when they were required by law my

1044
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,960
expectation is that probably

1045
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
when cars first came out and they didn't

1046
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,079
have seat belts

1047
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,800
maybe more people died in car accidents

1048
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
maybe when seat belts came

1049
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,720
and then they were required by law maybe

1050
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,119
fewer people died in car accidents

1051
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,200
and this is what i think i don't really

1052
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,240
see

1053
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,079
when i look at something like the owasp

1054
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,839
top 10. i wonder if that

1055
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,000
i wonder if that makes any sense oh no

1056
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
it does make sense uh the point there is

1057
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
that os top 10 is actually a qualitative

1058
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
relative ordering of things versus

1059
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
absolutely you cannot

1060
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,760
uh cannot really apply this way um

1061
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
another example if we started looking at

1062
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,079
particular type of sql injection

1063
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,839
uh sorry not test transaction let's say

1064
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
buffalo let's see let's start talking

1065
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,240
about

1066
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
if we break down the buffer overflows

1067
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
that for example would lead to a stack

1068
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,480
overrun which is going to cost something

1069
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,599
now 20 years ago that was a problem now

1070
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,520
stack canadians are pretty much standard

1071
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
for any compiler you can think of

1072
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,560
so if we go to that granularity level

1073
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
we're actually not going to see it

1074
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,000
and we're going to say yes we solved

1075
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,760
that problem but

1076
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,800
other problems of that class came out

1077
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,040
uh and since we have them lumped in in

1078
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,079
this big

1079
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,720
thing uh we kind of may think that

1080
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,400
things have not been resolved but

1081
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,839
but we're actually making quite a lot of

1082
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,839
progress so i i personally

1083
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,640
think it's it's important for us to also

1084
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,720
acknowledge the progress we have

1085
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,319
i have heard a lot of bashing on

1086
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,560
security from uh folks saying oh yeah

1087
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,240
we're kind of going in circles no we're

1088
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,520
not going in circles

1089
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
uh we're going uh fairly fast but the

1090
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,200
technology we're trying to secure

1091
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,400
is going just as fast if not even faster

1092
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,599
in some cases

1093
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,400
thus we're having those security gaps

1094
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
and also if you have noticed

1095
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,640
when the security gaps become too big uh

1096
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,520
technology

1097
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,200
is forced to stop because then the

1098
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,640
operations teams

1099
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
actually slow down in their deployments

1100
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,000
focus on more

1101
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
patching when they see that they have

1102
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,599
too many uh security issues and then

1103
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:41,920
when

1104
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,839
when they feel confident again that

1105
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,440
they're not hacked then they start

1106
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,240
rushing again

1107
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,520
and then the security team starts

1108
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,280
chasing them and then they slow down

1109
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,920
again

1110
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,960
so i think yes normal progression yes i

1111
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280
totally agree i think it's absolutely an

1112
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
evolution

1113
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,160
um you know uh

1114
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,760
in my yard i have a fence

1115
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,920
and the deer jump over the fence and so

1116
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
i build a higher fence

1117
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,119
and then maybe the deer jump higher

1118
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
right so i i do think there is kind of

1119
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,079
this like

1120
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,319
progressive evolutionary thing i also

1121
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,520
while i think that there are themes

1122
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
in the cyber security industry that have

1123
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,640
stayed consistent

1124
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,640
over decades i'm i'm not at all here to

1125
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,440
sort of bash uh the state of the

1126
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,160
industry

1127
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,960
or say that you know the efforts of the

1128
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,839
professionals have not gone anywhere

1129
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,440
in my case actually the point i'm trying

1130
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,960
to make is that

1131
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,119
i think that while solving technical

1132
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,480
problems and security

1133
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
is very hard and should be very

1134
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
respected

1135
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,280
i actually think that people in process

1136
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,160
problems matter just as much and i think

1137
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,040
there is less

1138
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,760
of a spotlight because sometimes it's a

1139
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
little

1140
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,079
less sexy to say hey

1141
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,920
uh why don't you round up all your

1142
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
engineering leaders and convince them

1143
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,160
to patch their systems you know that

1144
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
that's kind of not as exciting as like

1145
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,079
oh my gosh this zero day it's crazy

1146
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,400
you know and so i i think that um that

1147
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,000
that's a little bit of one of the points

1148
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,880
that i'm trying to make you have another

1149
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,599
q a

1150
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,599
uh that you haven't answered yet carolyn

1151
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
if you could uh

1152
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,880
see it way to keep up with all town

1153
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,160
security

1154
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,760
is there a good way to stay alert so

1155
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,240
actually like all these rss feeds you

1156
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,520
can subscribe to

1157
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,720
um i think that

1158
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,000
it depends right there is uh

1159
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
there's cvs you can say like what are

1160
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,839
the new vocabularies coming out i want

1161
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,880
to know about them

1162
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,119
if you're less interested about it then

1163
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
at that like sort of specific

1164
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,000
technic gram granular um there's a lot

1165
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,400
of

1166
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,680
other podcasts not my podcast uh but

1167
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,520
here's my internet again okay

1168
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
hopefully i'm back i got a little your

1169
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,040
internet sucks

1170
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,280
breaking up a little bit but we can we

1171
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,319
still see you

1172
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,200
okay good thank you so

1173
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,359
there are uh there's blogs there's

1174
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,560
podcasts

1175
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,240
i actually really like a guy named

1176
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,200
daniel measler he has both a podcast

1177
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,319
as well as a blog called

1178
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,599
unsupervised learning um and while it's

1179
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,240
not

1180
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
only about technical security

1181
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,359
vulnerabilities i think that

1182
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,640
daniel's podcast and his uh

1183
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,000
newsletter have a really good

1184
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,400
that's what i use to keep up to date

1185
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,000
with industry happenings

1186
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,880
um i see another one actually uh from

1187
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,520
michael

1188
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
in the chat does the industry really

1189
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
want us to solve the issue

1190
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,480
uh if boards and c-levels think that

1191
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,400
solutions are complicated and complex

1192
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
rather than fundamental doesn't that

1193
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,240
benefit organizations such as goldball

1194
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,200
um what a fun and a funny question

1195
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,880
i think that in my experience

1196
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,079
interacting with boards

1197
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,119
i think boards

1198
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,359
just want to solve problems i don't know

1199
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,119
that they're enamored with complex

1200
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,119
and complicated things i actually think

1201
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,319
that um

1202
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,839
when i speak with colleagues of mine

1203
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,079
who are for example chief information

1204
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,839
security officers presenting to the

1205
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,720
board

1206
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,240
um one of the challenges that i think

1207
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,560
some

1208
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,880
csos have is how do i communicate

1209
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,520
all of this stuff to the board in a way

1210
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
that

1211
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,599
is going to be well received and

1212
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,119
understood and ultimately maybe going to

1213
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,400
persuade

1214
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,520
this board to support my recommended

1215
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,040
plan of action

1216
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,839
so i actually think that

1217
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,599
convincing someone to give you money

1218
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,359
often involves convincing that person

1219
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,520
that the problem is solvable and that

1220
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,119
you can have a plan that will actually

1221
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:13,920
work

1222
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,040
um i think that um some csos

1223
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,440
struggle with communicating to the board

1224
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,599
because if the board doesn't understand

1225
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,079
what a cso's trying to communicate i

1226
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,400
think they're unlikely to give

1227
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,680
money over uh budget and head count

1228
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,920
to something that they don't understand

1229
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,359
especially

1230
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,040
when it's compared against something

1231
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
that they might understand

1232
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,640
much more clearly things like marketing

1233
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,839
or sales or engineering dollars

1234
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,800
i think we've i guess the timing's kind

1235
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,480
of good we've got like three minutes

1236
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,200

1237
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,240
