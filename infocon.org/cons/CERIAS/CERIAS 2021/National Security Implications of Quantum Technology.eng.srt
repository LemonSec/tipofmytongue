1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,640
so hello everyone and good afternoon

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
uh it's a somewhat overcast and

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,519
slightly chilly day here in west

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,000
lafayette which is a nice break from the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,920
hot weather we've had recently

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,440
um and uh

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
it's it's not quite cold quanta but it

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,560
is uh

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,439
it is nice uh nice weather here for

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,199
being inside and listening to this

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,320
symposium

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
uh our speaker today is laura thomas and

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,359
she's the

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
senior director of national security

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
solutions at cold quanta

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
which is a company that does work in no

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,200
surprise

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
quantum technologies she's had an

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,079
experience in the us intelligence

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,040
community

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
has worked with the national security

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
council department of state department

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,760
of defense

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
and basically a number of other people

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,879
who are very interested in advanced

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,000
technology

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,079
its applications and its potential

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
threats

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
this is put in a great position to be

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
able to understand those topics

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
and to turn around and then present them

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
to us so

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
please welcome laura thomas and she'll

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,439
talk to us about the national security

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,400
implications

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
of quantum technology laura thank you

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,560
for being here

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
all right thank you so much for having

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
me i'm really thrilled

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
uh i was thrilled to get the invitation

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
so yes i'm gonna be talking to you all

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,840
today about

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
uh all things quantum well i guess all

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,240
things non-technical about quantum that

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,799
is

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
i think because to really understand it

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,320
you would have to have

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
an advanced degree in physics or

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
mathematics and even then it would still

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,280
be

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
quite difficult to understand a quote

52
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
from a recent book

53
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
that i've been reading by a physicist

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,159
named carla rivelli

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
he said that quantum theory has never

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
been wrong

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
it's the beating heart of today's

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,479
science

59
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,520
yet it remains profoundly mysterious

60
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,640
and subtly disturbing and then if we

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
have another quote from another famous

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,799
physicist

63
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
it's niels bohr and he said those who

64
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,000
are not

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
shocked when they first come across

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
quantum theory

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
whether they possibly or they cannot

68
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
possibly have understood it

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
and then he followed that up with i do

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
not like quantum mechanics and i'm sorry

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,319
i ever had anything to do with it

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,840
which i i found kind of funny

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
considering that's pretty much

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
everything that i'm working on right now

75
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
and then we of course have nobel prize

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,959
winning physicist richard feynman

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
and he said nobody understands quantum

78
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
mechanics

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
and he was including himself and a lot

80
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
of physicists a lot of his business

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,599
colleagues at the time

82
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
so with that i'm going to try to help

83
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
you understand the absolute basics of

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
quantum technology

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
and the applications of the national

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
security space

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,680
however if you have a highly technical

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,400
background

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
and you have questions that you'd like

90
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
answered that are very technical in

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
nature

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
please feel free to reach out to me on

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
linkedin

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
i can get you an answer i can also give

95
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,640
you some recommended reading if you

96
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
would like to

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440
explore that side a lot more

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
so to get started if we have a talkative

99
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
audience today

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
i'd love to hear either in the chat or

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
maybe it's in the question answer

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
function

103
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
you know when you hear the word quantum

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
you know what's the first thing

105
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
that that comes to your mind and then

106
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,720
you know once i flip to the

107
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
the next slide i'll tell you the first

108
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
thing that that i thought of

109
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
when i first heard quantum

110
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,879
so i'm looking in the chat here does

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,200
anyone wanna you have an answer

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
oh my gosh gavin and your last name's

113
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
thomas too i think we're

114
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
must be related somehow smallest unit

115
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,879
yes

116
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,840
sam beckett yeah

117
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,159
super advanced technology in determinism

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,239
okay so let me flip to the next slide

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,439
here

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
indeed uh this was my first thought when

121
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
i heard quantum

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
which is what gavin said um

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
you know i i think some of the audience

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
maybe you're my age or maybe you're

125
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,358
younger

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,279
and maybe you don't know what what this

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
slide is but when i was growing up in

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,600
the 80s and 90s there was this wonderful

129
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,639
tv show

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
called quantum leap and it's depicted on

131
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
the left and

132
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
basically the protagonist of the show he

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
was a physicist and he could leap

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,639
through time

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
he could take on different personas to

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,800
alter the course of history

137
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
and then on the right i added in

138
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
macgyver which was another excellent tv

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
show of the same era

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
it's about a guy who worked for a

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
clandestine intelligence service

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
and he could uh essentially

143
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
non-violently he could change the world

144
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
by

145
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
using a swiss army knife and apparently

146
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,199
in this this picture

147
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,919
a match and macgyver has nothing to do

148
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,880
with quantum

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
but in my mind these two shows sort of

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,240
run together

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
and i think maybe they had more of an

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
impact on me than i realized at the time

153
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
because i ended up working in

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
both uh fields you know first as an

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
intelligence officer

156
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
and now i'm working for quantum

157
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
computing instance and company

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
and i'll talk a little bit more about my

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,199
intelligence

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
background a little bit later it's going

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
to the next slide

162
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
so what is what is it

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
really um and so the word quantum

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
it's just the plural of quanta and in

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
latin how much

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
and in physics it's it's basically the

167
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,919
smallest amount

168
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
of any physical entity and in the

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
quantum world we're looking at the level

170
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,039
of the individual atom and its electrons

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
and you know the tv show that i really

172
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
enjoyed in my younger years quantum leap

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,199
well the name is actually derived from

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,240
when an electron jumps in orbit around

175
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
an atom

176
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,600
and it's this is sort of the crux of

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
quantum theory that

178
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
you know these electrons they don't

179
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,960
necessarily move in a defined trajectory

180
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
they're more like waves or events rather

181
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,080
than

182
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
things and quantum theory is really the

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
theory of how things influence each

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,479
other

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,360
and famous physicist erwin schroedinger

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,319
who

187
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,919
came up with the famous metaphor of

188
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,759
schrodinger's cat um

189
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,680
you know a quote that he said is it's

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
better to consider a particle

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
not as a permanent entity but rather as

192
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
an instantaneous event

193
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,000
sometimes these events form chains that

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
give them the illusion

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
of being permanent but only in

196
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
particular circumstance and

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
only for an extremely brief period of

198
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
time in each individual case

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,479
and then if we go back to more current

200
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,680
time

201
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
physicist carlo revelli he gave what i

202
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,800
think is a

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
good metaphor for it you know if we're

204
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
sitting in the atlantic ocean and we're

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
on a boat

206
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
and we could absolutely see each wave we

207
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
could feel the wave you know some might

208
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,479
be

209
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
enormous some might be small but if

210
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,520
we're

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
sitting on the moon or standing on the

212
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
moon and looking back to earth

213
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,880
you know the ocean it would look like a

214
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
very permanent object to us because

215
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
we're looking at it from a distance

216
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
and it you know it doesn't move quantum

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
physics basically says that

218
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
even the things that we look at today in

219
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
front of you your computer

220
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,240
your chair your desk it doesn't exist in

221
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
the permanent form that we're actually

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,639
seeing it

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
and that was what was so disturbing to

224
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
physicists when they first discovered

225
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,199
quantum theory you know basically the

226
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
world does not work

227
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
in the way that that we observe it and

228
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
you know it made

229
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
them and us still today you know we're

230
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,440
constantly

231
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,479
questioning our reality based on it so

232
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,000
i'm going to briefly speak on

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
two topics that you often hear

234
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
when anyone's talking about quantum and

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
those are superposition

236
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
and entanglement so first with

237
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
superposition

238
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
the idea of superstition it's very hard

239
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
to render into words

240
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
and and how i'm going to describe it is

241
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,639
a bit more metaphorical and not 100

242
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,000
percent you know the way it works in

243
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,039
physics but it's

244
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
it's the notion that an electron an atom

245
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
can be in more

246
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,919
more than one state um and it can its

247
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,800
spin

248
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
can be you know up or down or different

249
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
variations in between and it's really

250
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
that when we go to measure it is when it

251
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
gets fixed into

252
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,560
uh one state and if you look on the

253
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
right here uh it's a fairly typical

254
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,680
picture

255
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
uh representation it's known as a block

256
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,960
sphere

257
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
and electrons can be spin-ups and down

258
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,000
or

259
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
all the variations in between and

260
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
you know i'm sure this audience is well

261
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,640
aware much

262
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
even more so than i am you know how

263
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,919
everyday computers

264
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
function and that computers and

265
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
information you know

266
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
it's running off of bits and bits are

267
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,399
very binary

268
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,920
system and bits are either in the one or

269
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
zero state

270
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
and it's the strings of ones and zeros

271
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
that essentially make up

272
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
uh computing today but because of

273
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
superposition

274
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,200
we can build quantum bits known as

275
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
qubits and they don't have to conform to

276
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,760
this binary state they can be one and

277
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
zero

278
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,920
at the same time but also all the values

279
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,640
in between

280
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
and in between and the spin state up or

281
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,480
the spin state down

282
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
and that essentially opens up a lot of

283
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
computational power

284
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
and it's why everyone is so excited

285
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
about quantum computing

286
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
and then second entanglement

287
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
entanglement is

288
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,120
simply the phenomena that two particles

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
associated with each other

290
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
they'll always know each other's state

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
even when the particles are split apart

292
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,560
and different actions are performed on

293
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
them inherently the particle in another

294
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
location

295
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,800
will know uh what is happening to the

296
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,519
particle

297
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,160
in the you know the the base station so

298
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
to speak so

299
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
you know if if there's a particle here

300
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,320
in washington dc and then there's a

301
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
particle where you are

302
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
um intrinsically they understand what

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
each other is going through in a

304
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
metaphorical way and einstein

305
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,040
called this spooky action at a distance

306
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,680
and

307
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,160
you know from the lay person uh like me

308
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
it sort of it seems to

309
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
uh defy common sense that that can be

310
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
the case

311
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,720
um so that you know that's much more on

312
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
the theory and the physics side

313
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,240
you know what does it actually mean for

314
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
us today with technology and

315
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
you know it means we can take these

316
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
properties and the phenomena

317
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
and use them to build quantum computers

318
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,519
quantum sensors

319
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
and quantum networks for communications

320
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
i'll go to the next slide um a little

321
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,880
word of

322
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
caution um you know

323
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
we have to accept that this physics is

324
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
it's really hard and that we're

325
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,800
oversimplifying it going back to

326
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,079
physicist richard feynman

327
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
you know he once said that um quantum

328
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
electrodynamics which is what he won the

329
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
nobel prize for

330
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
that if it were possible to describe it

331
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,959
in a few sentences then it wouldn't have

332
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
been worth a nobel prize

333
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
so i think that's very true here

334
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,720
so now you know before i get into the

335
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
applications i'll

336
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
walk you through a bit of why i'm here

337
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
why i care so much about

338
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
this emerging technology and it's

339
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
because most of my professional

340
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
career it was spent serving as a case

341
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
officer with the central intelligence

342
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,480
agency

343
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
and a case officer is the person who

344
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
recruits foreign spy

345
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
steals secrets and jet sets around the

346
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
world using an assortment of

347
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,800
martial arts shaken martinis and

348
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,079
sometimes blackmail to get what they

349
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:30,800
want

350
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
that's of course if you believe the

351
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
movie version

352
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
uh reality is is a lot different and

353
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
certainly less glamorous

354
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
but it is true that we recruit

355
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
foreigners to provide intelligence

356
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
with the us government and we handle

357
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
relationships

358
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
with those individuals and it is

359
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
absolutely critical

360
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,320
that we do everything in our power and i

361
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,279
really mean

362
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,639
everything to keep those assets safe

363
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,639
and for a lot of reasons

364
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,279
that i won't necessarily go go into here

365
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,320
today

366
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
but that's how i went down sort of this

367
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
rabbit hole of quantum

368
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
because i first heard of quantum when i

369
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
was working at cia

370
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
i was talking to one of our technical

371
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,480
officers about

372
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
encryption schemes and i asked him how

373
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
long would it take

374
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
a high performance computer to break the

375
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,480
current

376
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
standards of encryption that we were

377
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
using in a very specific

378
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,120
case that i had and he

379
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,760
responded with uh the answer that it

380
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
could be thousands or millions of years

381
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,320
and he followed it up with something

382
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
that got my attention he said well

383
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
that's if until quantum computing really

384
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,040
becomes

385
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,079
real and so i asked the natural

386
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,200
follow-on question

387
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
well when does it become real and

388
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,399
his answer was disturbing he said nobody

389
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
really knows it could be five years it

390
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
could be 20 years

391
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
so you know that again it got my

392
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,040
attention

393
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,279
and i started doing a lot of you know

394
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
just

395
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
research just on google and trying to

396
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
understand what is this quantum

397
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
computing thing and do i need to worry

398
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
about it as a case officer with a cia

399
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
because if we're working with encryption

400
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
that eventually could be broken

401
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
you know we need to understand how we

402
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
can mitigate the effects of that

403
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
and prepare for it in the future and you

404
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:20,959
know

405
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,639
going back to working at cia i think

406
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
what a lot of my job was was to discern

407
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
between truths and lies and everything

408
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,680
in between

409
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
and you know understanding people's

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
motivations and part of that has

411
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,720
somewhat made me

412
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,639
a natural skeptic or it's at least

413
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,639
tapped into maybe that that stream that

414
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,519
was already

415
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
within me and you know once we believe

416
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
in something you know we spend a lot of

417
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
our time trying to justify why we

418
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,360
believe it

419
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,160
rather than questioning it so it was

420
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
very important to me to go to see

421
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,760
what what are the skeptics of quantum

422
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
saying and um

423
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
you know would that sway my opinion so i

424
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
started reading a lot about

425
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
uh what the skeptics were saying and and

426
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,600
their answers and

427
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,519
sort of seeing what they were saying

428
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
evolve over time

429
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
and it made me a bit more bullish on on

430
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,800
the fact that

431
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
the idea that the quantum technologies

432
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,160
were one real

433
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,639
and uh two that there's a significant

434
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,360
benefit

435
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,880
in quantum especially quantum systems

436
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,240
when you combine them with classical

437
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
systems you take a quantum computer and

438
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
you you know marry it up with a

439
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
classical computer

440
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,519
and that it really will outra outweighs

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
you know the traditional

442
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
approach that we have and it will solve

443
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
a subset

444
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,519
of problems that we just simply can't

445
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
solve on regular computers

446
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
and that the technology there is a

447
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,760
pathway for scaling it

448
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,440
so that's how i ended up leaving the cia

449
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
and joining a quantum computing company

450
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,920
i'll go to the next slide here

451
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
so on the national security space you

452
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
know quantum

453
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
it really is a double-edged sword um

454
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,279
us government officials they've made

455
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,160
statements that

456
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
have made it very clear uh the us

457
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
government wants to

458
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
make sure that it understands the power

459
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
of the technology

460
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
from a defensive perspective and you

461
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,040
know what happens if

462
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
a hostile country or a country that has

463
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
interests that are

464
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
very counter to ours you know what if

465
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,240
they can marshal

466
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
the power of of quantum to break all

467
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
encryption what happens to our most

468
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,199
sensitive

469
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,000
us government communications and and

470
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
it's not just us government you know

471
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,320
national

472
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,079
economic security is national security

473
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,600
so what happens if

474
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
public communications that are still

475
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
extremely sensitive or proprietary

476
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
nature

477
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
like banking transactions and personal

478
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
email and

479
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
medical records and anything related to

480
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
intellectual property

481
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
you know what if that can easily be

482
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
broken and stolen

483
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,199
and we've already seen the hacks in

484
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,399
these areas and

485
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,320
the general destruction that that it

486
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
creates and

487
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
you know there's a real question out

488
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,959
there if a nation state were to

489
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,440
give a quantum hacking capability for

490
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
example to

491
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
a group that they don't necessarily

492
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
embrace as their own but they certainly

493
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
use for their interests as we've

494
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
seen happen time and time again you know

495
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
it would make the colonial pipeline hack

496
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
or the sony hack it would make it look

497
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,680
like child's play

498
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
so you know we already know that china

499
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
for example is pouring billions of

500
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
dollars into this technology

501
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
and you know that's on the defensive

502
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
side for the us government

503
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,680
offensively what if we can offensively

504
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,079
use

505
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,560
these capabilities and how much would

506
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
that change the world order

507
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
and some of our strategic deterrence

508
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
initiatives

509
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
and isaac asimov he had a really good

510
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
quote that

511
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
he said science gathers knowledge faster

512
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,639
than society

513
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,040
gathers wisdom and i really do think

514
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,000
that that

515
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,320
we have to think about that and you know

516
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
that conversation will

517
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,199
quickly get political it'll get

518
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,800
philosophical

519
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
but it's these questions that we're

520
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
going to have to grapple with um

521
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
in the future as a country as a society

522
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
and really you know

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,839
um as humanity across the world

524
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
okay so with national security

525
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
um why does the national security

526
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
community

527
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
really care in addition to the the

528
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
quantum computing and the potential

529
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,919
threat to encryption which again quite

530
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,839
long term but

531
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
eventually will be there and it's for

532
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,439
all these reasons

533
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
that now you can you can see here you

534
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,480
can imagine

535
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
um looking at oh come back looking at

536
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
all of these

537
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
where in the national security realm

538
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
there would be interest

539
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,120
uh if you look at gps we have an over

540
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
reliance on gps and us government is

541
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
is trying to find ways for precision

542
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,280
navigation and timing

543
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,200
that get us off of gps and

544
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,280
you know with our military vehicles for

545
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
example how could they navigate

546
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,440
without having to connect to satellites

547
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,240
somewhere

548
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,320
and it's not just vehicles it could be

549
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
submarines it can be

550
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,039
um uavs aircraft

551
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
and then there's a whole host of uh

552
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,480
optimization problems that it could

553
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
solve how do we

554
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,720
uh take our troops and how do we do

555
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
logistics how do we

556
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,280
put the right people where they need to

557
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
be and how do we solve some of our

558
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
you know major issues with keeping

559
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
vehicles uh the maintenance up on

560
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,160
vehicles

561
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
and and these are all very complex sort

562
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
of mathematical problems that quantum

563
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
computing

564
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,919
could certainly address

565
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120
let me go to the next slide

566
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
so first i'll talk about quantum

567
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
computing and

568
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
uh you know i'll talk about three things

569
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
here quantum computing

570
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
quantum sensing and then quantum

571
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
networking so

572
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
quantum computing the first one i'm not

573
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,919
going to read

574
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,760
exactly from the slides here but um

575
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,080
you know you'll see a lot in the news

576
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
about quantum computing and we've come a

577
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
very long way

578
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
in the last 10 years with with computing

579
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
but if you read the headlines you know

580
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,120
you'd think that we've solved the

581
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
problem and there's a quantum computer

582
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,559
that's just waiting to tell us all the

583
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,160
secrets of the universe and um

584
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
as we see with quantum at large there's

585
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,360
a big gap in how

586
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
quantum computers work and our ability

587
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
to explain them in very simple terms

588
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,320
and you know as usual uh reality is a

589
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,360
bit more nuanced

590
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,640
and the fact is we're still a very we're

591
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
still in the very early phases

592
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
of quantum computing and you may have

593
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,120
seen that

594
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,440
google a year or so ago announced they

595
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
had achieved quantum supremacy

596
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
and you know that means that they had

597
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,039
solved a problem on a quantum computer

598
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,440
that

599
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
would have taken a classical computer

600
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
thousands of years to solve

601
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,320
and what's important to note here is

602
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
that

603
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
the benchmarks that they used they're

604
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,679
contrived benchmarks and it's it's

605
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
in some ways a toy problem it's

606
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
basically proof of concept

607
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
and we're still quite a ways away from a

608
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
quantum computer that's going to solve a

609
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,039
meaningful problem

610
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,840
but we are getting closer and closer and

611
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
you know you'll see a range of estimates

612
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,840
from

613
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
anywhere from three to ten years where

614
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,679
we're really making a dent

615
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
in the universe with with the power of

616
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
our quantum computers

617
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,400
and exactly who holds the record for the

618
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
most qubits it depends on who you ask

619
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
the different people have different

620
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
ideas about

621
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,480
what standards need to be met qualify um

622
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
as a quantum computer

623
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
but to go back to the encryption issue

624
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
to break encryption

625
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
we will probably need at least a couple

626
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
hundred thousand

627
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
if not millions of qubits of

628
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,520
computational power to do that

629
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
and where we are today is in the

630
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,440
hundreds so that gives you a sense of

631
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
of the challenges that would be ahead

632
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,559
for that

633
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,159
okay so here's a very basic chart

634
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
on the expected phases of quantum

635
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
computing

636
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
um right now we're still in the nisk era

637
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,120
what does that mean nisk stands for

638
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,000
noisy intermediate

639
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
scale quantum and it just means early

640
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
days

641
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
there's a lot of noise in these

642
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,520
computers and noise being things that

643
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
environmental things that that affect

644
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,679
the qubits ability to function and

645
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,080
properly perform uh

646
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
the computations or perform them in a

647
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,200
way that that really gives us

648
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,120
the sort of probabilistic answers that

649
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,799
we're looking for

650
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,559
uh 10 years out we think there's

651
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,919
certainly going to be

652
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,280
it's going to be a much different

653
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,360
landscape around quantum computing

654
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
and then 20 years out and who can really

655
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
predict it that's so far away but

656
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,880
um you know we expect that quantum

657
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,000
computer will be able to do things that

658
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
problems that we can't even uh conceive

659
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
of for example you know with the iphone

660
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
no one knew that the whole app industry

661
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
was going to be in industry

662
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
you know 20 years from now um in some

663
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,679
ways that's

664
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
sort of how we're looking at quantum we

665
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
don't even know

666
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
what the applications will be in the

667
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
future

668
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
so i'm going to move on to quantum

669
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,400
sensing and this is an area that's

670
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
it's really it's it's less discussed but

671
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
it has been around for quite some time

672
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,320
and we're still in the early phases of

673
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,640
some aspects of quantum sensing but in

674
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
other aspects uh with atomic clocks for

675
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
example they've been out for

676
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
for a while but essentially quantum

677
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
sensing is using the same

678
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,960
fundamental properties of quantum

679
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
mechanics to

680
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
take measurements and use an atom

681
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
and use the properties of it to sense

682
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
changes in the environment

683
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
and some of the things here on the left

684
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
of the screen

685
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
is what uh you know we can we can detect

686
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
and sense

687
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,840
using uh atoms

688
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
and then on the right you'll see some of

689
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
the applications

690
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,559
that would or that are derived from that

691
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
and then that turns into quantum sensing

692
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
products

693
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
so like i said atomic clocks they exist

694
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,679
today they've existed for quite some

695
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,400
time

696
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
uh for example you know a number of

697
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,679
companies sell them my company sells

698
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,320
them

699
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
uh but going beyond atomic clocks what

700
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,679
are some of the

701
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,440
products would be inertial navigation

702
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
systems that's a top priority

703
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,280
that goes into can we can we truly

704
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,159
can we enable true uh truly autonomous

705
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,200
vehicles

706
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,919
a vehicle that does not have to rely on

707
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,520
a gps signal

708
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,400
to to operate and to operate in a way

709
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
that is extremely precise so

710
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
when you do have you know the child that

711
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,679
runs out in front of the road the

712
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,720
vehicle

713
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
if it doesn't have gps signal it can

714
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,159
still perform the functions that it

715
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,640
needs to perform

716
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
going further down the list quantum rf

717
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
as we call it

718
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
it's essentially signals detection

719
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
and then gravimeters gradiometers is

720
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
detecting changes

721
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
um in in the earth using gravity

722
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,480
and subsurface changes so if we're

723
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
looking uh you know what where's north

724
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
korea burying its nukes

725
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
that's a good example or what submarines

726
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,120
are

727
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,000
lurking underneath uh waters in the

728
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
ocean

729
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

730
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
atomic clocks since

731
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
it is probably one of the most advanced

732
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,400
fields

733
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,279
um that sort of encompasses quantum

734
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,320
sensing

735
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,960
and why they really matter so atomic

736
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,000
clocks they they

737
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,760
essentially they're a time keeping

738
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
function like any clock but they're

739
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,720
extremely precise

740
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,559
and it really precise timing is

741
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,520
important for

742
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,360
networks as i'm sure many of you

743
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
understand already

744
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,640
so one thing that that we're working on

745
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,039
is

746
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
how to make those autonomous clocks even

747
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,480
better and perform

748
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,360
longer over time and then how do we use

749
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,279
those clocks and combine them

750
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
with accelerometers and gyroscopes to

751
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,400
create

752
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,480
an inertial navigation system that's

753
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
wholly independent of gps

754
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,320
because like i mentioned earlier i think

755
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,039
most people

756
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,240
especially in the us government

757
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,279
understand that you know relying on gps

758
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,679
it's certainly a vulnerability we know

759
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,320
that it can be denied it can be spoofed

760
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
and in the national security community

761
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,679
we want to see how can we

762
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
navigate in a way that does not

763
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
peg us in a certain location as well so

764
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
there's certainly a

765
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
defensive and offensive use of if we

766
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
were to have a small device

767
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,919
that could fit in a backpack for example

768
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
where we could navigate without having

769
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,279
to rely on anything external

770
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
you could see the use case in that for

771
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
aircraft as well

772
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,440
uh plane and planes but also

773
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
drones and certainly ships

774
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
and essentially any vehicle

775
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
and then going into quantum sensing or

776
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,720
sorry quantum radio frequency

777
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,840
which is an aspect of quantum sensing

778
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,080
the application space here is extremely

779
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,039
broad

780
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,000
and again this is all very dual use

781
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,840
technology so you can see where in the

782
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
national security space

783
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
this would apply radar lidar

784
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
generally detecting if people are

785
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,960
carrying weapons

786
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,760
increasing telecommunication right now

787
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
if you go into some cityscapes

788
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
you don't get very good signal because

789
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
of concrete or because of barriers

790
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
or if you're going into a tunnel and you

791
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
know

792
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,400
in some cases that's just a minor

793
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
annoyance and some it really could

794
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
mean a difference in life or death so

795
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,919
how can

796
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,760
using quantum phenomena how can we

797
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,039
increase uh

798
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,440
signal and that would also decrease the

799
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,640
power you would need in many devices

800
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
to connect to those signals

801
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,840
and then lastly we have quantum

802
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,760
communications

803
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
and you know this is an area that is

804
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
certainly debatable about um you know

805
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,200
where we're going to go as a us

806
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
government are we eventually going to

807
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,559
transition to some sort of

808
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,120
quantum internet i don't know the answer

809
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,399
to that but there's certainly a lot of

810
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,000
people researching and

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,679
researching this and putting a lot of

812
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,039
money towards it

813
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,840
and you know today most encryption it's

814
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,960
it's based on

815
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
the difficulty of factoring really large

816
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
semi-prime numbers

817
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
and decoding them with classical

818
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,520
computers it's just not

819
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,559
not really possible and um you know

820
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,440
quantum computers

821
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
they'll make most encryption standards

822
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
today obsolete

823
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,600
that's on the sort of offensive side but

824
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,799
on the defensive side

825
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
we can use the same properties of

826
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
quantum to create quantum networks and

827
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,960
quantum networks

828
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,200
they cannot be eavesdropped upon because

829
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,279
they're fundamentally secure

830
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,600
so part of this quantum networking is

831
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
quantum repeater development and that's

832
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,679
one thing that my company in particular

833
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,640
is looking at

834
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,840
and you know there are a number of

835
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
players doing the same thing

836
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,399
and you know it essentially is you have

837
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
to take this information and you have to

838
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,760
hold it for a period of time before you

839
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
can broadcast it over a long distance

840
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,559
because

841
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,559
what good is a quantum network if it's

842
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,480
just over a very short distance

843
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,919
it would just create you know secure

844
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,000
communications over a very short

845
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,520
area and that's really not what we're

846
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
going for you know how can we

847
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
communicate with satellites and those

848
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
satellites communicate

849
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
with other places across the earth

850
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,640
using a quantum network also

851
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,880
there the challenges with with quantum

852
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
networking is

853
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,919
we still face some of the same

854
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,919
challenges of you can always have a

855
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,480
human

856
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,360
tell you uh the information you want you

857
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,120
can always recruit a spy

858
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,480
to spy on the quantum network so

859
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
the idea that you know quantum network

860
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,000
is just going to make everything

861
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
completely secure well that's not

862
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
necessarily true

863
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
because you still have the end points as

864
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
i'm sure you know many people on this

865
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,919
webinar understand very well there's

866
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,760
still areas of vulnerability

867
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
but fundamentally the network between

868
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,679
you know a quantum node

869
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,399
is going to be extremely secure and

870
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,279
quantum repeater

871
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
is one of the hardest parts of the

872
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,640
technology to create

873
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,520
how do you keep that data in a state um

874
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,240
that

875
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,960
that keeps the integrity of the data as

876
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,120
you transmit it across a broad distance

877
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,799
and that's one thing that that we're

878
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
working on

879
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,080
to help you know eventually enable a

880
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
quantum internet

881
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,240
so here i have a a basic timeline

882
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,120
of what a number of industry experts at

883
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,679
least have assessed to be

884
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,200
how quantum networks will evolve and

885
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
you know you can see right now we're at

886
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,480
the phase of

887
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
post-quantum cryptography that's

888
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,480
essentially saying that

889
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,159
you know we can we can roll out

890
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,919
this post-quantum cryptography on our

891
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
networks and and it will

892
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
prevent future quantum computers from

893
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,799
being able to decrypt

894
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,760
uh some of our data right now uh that's

895
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,440
a booming industry

896
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
uh and there's a lot of work going on

897
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,360
with nist to

898
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
choose the algorithms and the standards

899
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,760
that they're going to deploy for these

900
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
um networks and then if you go all the

901
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
way to the end here

902
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,320
we're talking the fully entangled

903
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
internet fully quantum internet

904
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,120
and i think the glaring thing when i saw

905
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
this chart for me at least is it says

906
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
timeline but there's no timeline

907
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,440
and i think if if any of you follow the

908
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
quantum space

909
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
this is sort of a recurring theme um

910
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
it's really hard to predict

911
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,279
you know the actual timelines associated

912
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,200
with it in some ways you can compare it

913
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
to predicting a hurricane

914
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
i mean generally we know when hurricane

915
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,919
season is and we know somewhere in

916
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,600
florida is definitely going to get hit

917
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,480
every year

918
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
but saying that a hurricane is going to

919
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,960
be you know taking this specific path

920
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
and it's going to be on this specific

921
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
date well that's really difficult and

922
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
that's sort of similar to

923
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,919
predicting the future of quantum

924
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,440
all right and now we have warfare in the

925
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,559
future

926
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,000
and um this slide i

927
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
i found it a couple months ago i think

928
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,200
it was on

929
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
linkedin and it was because a number of

930
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,240
people in the national security

931
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,279
community

932
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,080
were essentially mocking it and you know

933
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
because we hear so much about quantum

934
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,919
and there is quite a bit of height

935
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
in the space and this slide basically

936
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,240
you know it would make you think that um

937
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,919
everything soon is going to be quantum

938
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,760
well we are ways out but there

939
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
there is a basis for all of these things

940
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,919
that are that are listed here

941
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,240
and i think pretty much everyone is is

942
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
under development and

943
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,000
and has been concluded as absolutely

944
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
possible

945
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,679
except for maybe quantum radar uh china

946
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,640
has announced they

947
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,760
they have a quantum radar capability uh

948
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
that's certainly subject to a lot of

949
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,840
scrutiny there are a number of

950
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
physicists and others who say that

951
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
that's actually not possible

952
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,760
but in general you know things on this

953
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,880
this chart

954
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,440
are being actively worked on if you just

955
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,360
want to go look up some of the darpa

956
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
work that's going on in darpa uh

957
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,559
contracts

958
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
related to quantum you'll see uh mention

959
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
of many of these

960
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,240
aspects so going back to china

961
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
you know we do have to think about you

962
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
know how much are they pouring into

963
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,840
the the quantum uh world

964
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,279
they're certainly in the lead

965
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,080
patent-wise uh they've invested over

966
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,960
10 billion dollars in in the technology

967
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,600
the us

968
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
is is about at two billion dollars so

969
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
there's certainly a large gap there

970
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
they china has a four million square

971
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,279
foot facility

972
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,880
in their country they've launched a

973
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,960
quantum satellite

974
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
and generally their focus is more on the

975
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,600
quantum networking side to keep their

976
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
communication secure i would say if we

977
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
look back to the united states

978
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
europe and some other players around the

979
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,240
world there's been much more focus on

980
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,919
quantum computing

981
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,320
and then you know sort of the one that

982
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,679
that doesn't get as much focus

983
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,519
as i've already talked about is quantum

984
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,919
sensing and that's an area where

985
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
uh my company were working pretty

986
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
heavily and there's certainly

987
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
a lot of interest from the us government

988
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
in in quantum sensing

989
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,679
so uh that's generally the overview

990
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,799
of of quantum that i have for you and

991
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,919
you know

992
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,679
the question is sort of why do i spend

993
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,919
my time you know doing a

994
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,640
a discussion like this and yeah sure

995
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,000
it's it's good for my company

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,320
to get our name out there but you know i

997
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,159
seriously doubt anyone here is going to

998
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,919
spend a couple hundred thousand dollars

999
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,320
on

1000
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,559
a quantum matter machine in the next

1001
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,360
quarter

1002
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
uh i do this really because you know i

1003
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,120
believe that quantum it's going to

1004
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,640
be a platform shift and it's going to

1005
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,840
fundamentally sort of change our

1006
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
thinking in the way we do certain things

1007
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
and you know i think it's going to

1008
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,320
unlock areas of research

1009
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
that we didn't even know possible and

1010
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
it's going to help us

1011
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,280
you know explain some of the

1012
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,520
underpinnings of our universe in a way

1013
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,719
that just has not been

1014
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,800
possible yet and you know we know that

1015
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,119
physics is an incomplete field

1016
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,000
and that there are um other laws waiting

1017
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,480
to be

1018
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
discovered and there's just still so

1019
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
much that that we don't know

1020
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,918
and you know to study and apply this is

1021
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,839
really to fundamentally question

1022
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,719
um everything and to be humble and to

1023
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,918
recognize that

1024
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,520
you know the tradition of what we've

1025
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,760
learned of how the world works

1026
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,679
you know that doesn't always equate to

1027
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
truth and you know we we have

1028
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,800
this um we all have this ability or

1029
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,399
opportunity for constant

1030
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,119
renewal and and learning and discovery

1031
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,879
you know who we are as a people

1032
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,200
and um how we're all interconnected and

1033
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,520
sort of quantum mechanics is really the

1034
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,320
foundation of that and you know i think

1035
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
one of the hardest

1036
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,119
but also most courageous things is to

1037
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,400
change our minds

1038
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,440
and quantum you know reveals that that

1039
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
we've we've really had to change our

1040
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,359
minds over the past hundred years about

1041
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,040
how the world works

1042
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,200
and so you know i hope if nothing else

1043
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
the the lecture makes you more curious

1044
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
about quantum and that ultimately it

1045
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,640
gives you

1046
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,480
more questions than it does answers

1047
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,359
so that's it for me i welcome any

1048
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,920
questions

1049
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
please post your questions in the q a

1050
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
section and we'll

1051
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,839
draw on those for glory to answer

1052
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,480
so i see one here in the chat protein

1053
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
folding and pharmaceuticals

1054
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,760
from richard yeah that's absolutely one

1055
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
application space and you know here i

1056
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,560
was more focused on

1057
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,280
national security but if we take a step

1058
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,680
back

1059
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
i mean like i did mention economic

1060
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,599
security is national security

1061
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,040
and the pharmaceutical space is one area

1062
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,800
that we're really looking

1063
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,040
very heavily towards to see what you

1064
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,960
know how can we apply

1065
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
some of these very hard problems how can

1066
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,880
we map them onto

1067
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
our quantum computer how can we deduce

1068
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,200
it into a mathematical

1069
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,680
expression that then we can run the

1070
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
gates from a quantum computer on it

1071
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,400
protein folding is certainly in there

1072
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
there are a number of middleware

1073
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,599
application companies that are doing

1074
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,000
this sort of applications research

1075
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
there's one that's called menton ai if

1076
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,440
you you're

1077
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,079
curious and you'd like to look into more

1078
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,760
of how they're doing research to

1079
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,160
to figure out how they can apply quantum

1080
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,359
to

1081
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,560
the pharmaceutical industry

1082
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,280
well i can't post in the q a so i'll ask

1083
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,720
one

1084
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,920
a lot of the quantum effects that we're

1085
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,119
interested in

1086
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,960
both from a computing and a sensing

1087
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,560
standpoint at least

1088
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
uh require very very

1089
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,599
cold environments very highly noise free

1090
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,040
environments

1091
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
and so they're not very portable and and

1092
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,400
very expensive

1093
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
and large

1094
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,240
do you see much there as likely to

1095
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280
change

1096
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
in the next decade yes definitely

1097
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,000
i mean for my company i mean that's one

1098
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,560
area of significant focus for us is

1099
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,079
how do we get the uh swap which is size

1100
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,359
weight and power

1101
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,040
and then swap c size weight and power

1102
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
and cost down and get it into

1103
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
a portable um something that can be

1104
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
deployed and that is also very

1105
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,960
rugged and can withstand you know

1106
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,480
changes in the environment

1107
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
i think the really interesting thing

1108
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,079
about the way cold quanta does it

1109
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,560
and we're called cold quanta because we

1110
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,400
use cold atom technology

1111
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,560
and yes we're cooling the atoms down to

1112
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
near absolute zero

1113
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
but we're not doing it with these very

1114
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,280
large refrigeration units

1115
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,720
if you look at some of the other

1116
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,200
modalities of quantum technology

1117
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,680
quantum computing they're having to use

1118
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,240
these

1119
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
really large cryogenic systems to get

1120
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
the temperature down

1121
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,800
so the atoms are stable enough to

1122
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,440
perform

1123
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,839
gates and computations on whereas we're

1124
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,119
using lasers

1125
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,280
and right now you know the challenge is

1126
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,320
laser technology

1127
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
and laser technology if you sort of look

1128
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,640
at the the trend it's it's there

1129
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,880
there have been so many breakthroughs so

1130
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
if we're using lasers to cool the atoms

1131
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,640
the question is how small can we get the

1132
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,520
lasers

1133
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
and how rugged can we get these lasers

1134
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
to be so we're getting it down to a

1135
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
package

1136
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,560
it's truly small enough to deploy you

1137
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,599
know

1138
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,640
on a drone for example where there's not

1139
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
a lot of space

1140
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,480
um that's left over from everything else

1141
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,320
that's that's on the device

1142
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,480
uh things that are easier or certainly

1143
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,000
ships you know they're probably one of

1144
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the first platforms where

1145
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,440
where these types of devices will be

1146
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,599
deployed because they're so large

1147
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,359
and you know they have the space that we

1148
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,960
don't necessarily have to have the small

1149
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,359
size

1150
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,560
yet but that's certainly a

1151
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
an area that i think within the next 10

1152
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,599
years

1153
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,680
you know it really is it's a it's an

1154
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,880
engineering challenge

1155
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
um it's not it's not a physics challenge

1156
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,160
anymore

1157
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
it's just can we get the right people

1158
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,640
together and the resources that we need

1159
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,839
to actually build these devices

1160
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
okay i see a question here would a

1161
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
nation state be able to build a quantum

1162
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
appliance dedicated to one function

1163
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
shore's algorithm for example or they

1164
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,240
always need to develop a general purpose

1165
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,880
computer

1166
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,359
or a combination of general appliance

1167
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,079
and

1168
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
i guess hp um that you know

1169
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,880
i'm not really the right person to ask

1170
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
that question i can say that

1171
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,560
um there is the

1172
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,359
the technology and resource needs that

1173
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,400
would go into

1174
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,599
building a quantum computer that is

1175
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,920
large enough and powerful enough to run

1176
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,040
shore's algorithm

1177
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,319
and thus break encryption it would

1178
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,599
it would be it would absolutely be a

1179
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,400
nation state

1180
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
that would would have to do that given

1181
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,920
the resources that would be needed

1182
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,560
there is discussion could you create a

1183
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,839
device

1184
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,599
that does not have to have all the

1185
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,200
properties of a quantum computer but

1186
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,520
just specifically focuses on

1187
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,359
breaking shore's algorithm and i know

1188
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,960
that that is something that's being

1189
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
debated among a lot of people in the u.s

1190
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,839
government right now

1191
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:07,839
all right any other questions

1192
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,839
i see three more in the q and a that

1193
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,720
can you see them or would you like them

1194
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
red to you okay

1195
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,400
yeah do you think this will be able to

1196
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,839
remove the new crypto standards and

1197
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,079
update tls before quantum can break them

1198
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,720
uh yeah i mean

1199
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,160
to break encryption i think like i said

1200
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
you know we're sort of in the range of

1201
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,640
a couple hundred qubits right now and

1202
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
and we would need

1203
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
um a lot more than that to actually

1204
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,119
break encryption

1205
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,960
from you know the intelligence community

1206
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,800
perspective and national security

1207
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,000
perspective

1208
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,520
it's it's more about you we know that

1209
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,599
other countries are harvesting our data

1210
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,400
and it's it's just not the us government

1211
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,680
that needs to be concerned about this

1212
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,520
it's really any institution especially a

1213
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,599
financial institution for example

1214
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,800
if if the data you know will be still

1215
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,240
extremely sensitive

1216
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,119
15 years from now when we might have a

1217
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:07,680
quantum

1218
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,200
computer that's capable of breaking

1219
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,880
encryption you know

1220
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
what information at that time that was

1221
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
generated today

1222
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
and transmitted today and harvested and

1223
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,000
collected today

1224
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,119
will still be incredibly

1225
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,680
vulnerable or make us vulnerable if read

1226
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,960
and you know any other questions i'm

1227
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,560
happy to answer them but i'm also happy

1228
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
to point you in the right direction

1229
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,960
you know a physicist or one of our

1230
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,119
engineers that that could answer it

1231
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
um i'm also you know i would share some

1232
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,240
some

1233
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,319
things that i've read recently that you

1234
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,240
know have sort of helped me think about

1235
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,119
the problem

1236
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,319
um one was uh

1237
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,880
anything by scott aronson he he's a bit

1238
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,280
sardonic in his approach to things and

1239
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,560
he certainly um he's a mathematician

1240
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,200
and he has very choice words for the

1241
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,000
physics

1242
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,160
and physicists sort of view of quantum

1243
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,920
but he has a really good book

1244
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
um and it's quantum computing since

1245
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,000
democritus

1246
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,920
i found that extremely helpful and then

1247
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,800
again carlo rivelli he recently released

1248
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,280
a book

1249
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,400
um helga land and it's sort of it goes

1250
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
from the beginning of quantum theory

1251
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,880
and how that's being spun out today into

1252
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,319
actual applications

1253
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,040
i have another question there in the q a

1254
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
okay so the questions of forbes piece

1255
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
last week made a point about usa

1256
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,359
focusing on nist

1257
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,720
and europe focusing on post-quantum

1258
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
algorithms in europe focusing on qkd uh

1259
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
quantum key distribution and other

1260
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,800
quantum crypto tech

1261
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,160
where do you stand um yeah that that's

1262
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,599
i mean that's absolutely i have not read

1263
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,920
that article but but there is a

1264
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,480
more of a focus in the us on actually

1265
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,599
creating

1266
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,400
the the algorithms whereas europe seems

1267
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,160
to be quite a ways ahead

1268
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,680
with qkd yeah there is some qkd work

1269
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,720
that's going on in the

1270
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,760
in the us i i imagine a number of you

1271
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,520
are tracking it there's some out of the

1272
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,200
university of chicago

1273
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,240
um you know it remains to be seen

1274
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,040
we're kind of getting messaging from nsa

1275
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
here in the us

1276
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,520
and with the uk government as well that

1277
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
don't don't look to qkd as the answer to

1278
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,570
all of your

1279
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,160
[Music]

1280
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,400
cyber security problems and it really

1281
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,319
goes back to the point that

1282
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,400
sure the the information may be

1283
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
extremely secure and theoretically

1284
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,599
you can't can't eavesdrop on it

1285
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,359
but that's you know from point to point

1286
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,640
what what happens if

1287
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,440
if the device or you know some other

1288
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,000
point of

1289
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
of that communication chain is

1290
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,480
compromised but it's not necessarily

1291
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,040
the the message in transit that we're so

1292
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,760
worried about

1293
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,760
today um it's it's

1294
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,560
it's more that um there are so many

1295
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,960
different ways to

1296
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,839
to compromise information where do i

1297
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,480
stand

1298
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,200
you know i don't know i my company we

1299
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,960
really don't focus on the quantum

1300
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
networking aspect as much i'm just

1301
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
sort of a an observer here waiting to

1302
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,760
see how it all plays out

1303
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,839
so gavin i think your question is going

1304
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,079
to be a bit too technical for me to

1305
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
answer

1306
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,240
okay i see uh richard has his hand

1307
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,839
raised also

1308
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,760
yeah a bit of a follow-up um

1309
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,359
i've heard that the next generation of

1310
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,359
gps

1311
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,960
is be is beginning to be deployed

1312
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,640
so is the risk to gps not so much that

1313
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
it's insecure

1314
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,520
because the next generation is supposed

1315
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,599
to be super secure

1316
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,000
but is the risk to gps that the

1317
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
satellites can be

1318
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,839
shot down

1319
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,000
yeah i mean i've heard debates on both

1320
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,880
sides i think

1321
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,960
the idea that the satellite can be shot

1322
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,880
down well

1323
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,800
that brings with it a whole question of

1324
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,640
intention and willingness

1325
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,720
from another country to actually do that

1326
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
and what would the repercussions be

1327
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,040
if a country shot down one of our

1328
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,480
satellites i mean it's almost sort of

1329
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,000
like mutually assured

1330
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,480
destruction in that case so from the

1331
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,240
angle that we're approaching

1332
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,879
it is

1333
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,040
not only can you get away from the

1334
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,000
vulnerabilities

1335
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,480
of gps but you actually can create a

1336
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,599
navigation device

1337
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,800
that's much more precise than gps

1338
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,480
so when you combine those two things

1339
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,560
together you know why would you use

1340
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,040
gps when you have something that that

1341
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
doesn't have the vulnerability and is

1342
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,599
better

1343
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,119
and of course the reason is because of

1344
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,560
cost and because we're still in the you

1345
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
know the earlier days of

1346
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,040
prototyping this technology it looks

1347
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,240
like we've

1348
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,040
run out of questions here and we're just

1349
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
about to the end of the

1350
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,640
seminar session so

1351
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,720
thank you so much for visiting and

1352
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,280
uh getting people to think a little bit

1353
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,800
about some of the issues that are

1354
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,319
involved

1355
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,839
this is going to be an area of

1356
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,880
considerable change during the careers

1357
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,920
of most of the

1358
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,960
people here listening and

1359
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,720
it's a good idea to start thinking about

1360
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,280
it sooner rather than later

1361
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,200
so we look forward to

1362
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,880
perhaps having you visit us again at

1363
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,480
another time yeah

1364
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,400
my pleasure and you know if anyone would

1365
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,559
like to reach out if there are other

1366
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,280
