hello everyone uh welcome to the uh

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
wednesday security seminar yet again um

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
it is it is my distinct pleasure to

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,799

uh is is really a legend in the field of

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
cyber security to the people who've been

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
working in it for a while

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,680
um he's uh he's got a history that goes

first um a1

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
secure systems under the old orange book

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
series the reba series

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,640
uh after more time at minor and trusted

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
information systems

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
he went to microsoft where he

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,879
was partner director of software

security

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,440
and helped lead the development of the

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
software security life cycle

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
software development life cycle there at

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
microsoft

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200

and

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,680
uh i'll say that microsoft uh colonel

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,640
went from being

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
one of the the least uh trustworthy

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
colonels to one of the most under his

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
supervision uh he retired a few years

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,280
ago

and is now the executive direct director

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
of safe code

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,600
so he has a long history of experience

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,400
building

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
very secure systems and helping to

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,000
secure systems that

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
weren't quite as secure and along the

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,439
way

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
learn some lessons and he's going to

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
share those with us today so

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520

so you you sort of you sort of hinted at

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,479
some of the things

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
that um that you know that i was going

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
to introduce in the in the first

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
first uh first slide um i uh

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
as you as you said i started i actually

53
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,440
started working

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
on on computer security as it was called

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
them

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
in uh in 1970 and i

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
i never i never quite got out of it

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
actually my my

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,560
boss at mitre said we've got this

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
problem

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,680
and i said well my degrees in civil

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
engineering i don't know anything about

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,599
the

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
you know computer science or you know

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
you're probably talking about proving

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,239
programs i don't know anything about

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,000
that

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,519
you want to get somebody with the right

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
background and and he said well i

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
that makes sense to me but i don't have

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,599
anybody to put on that assignment right

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,080
now

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,599
why don't you just see what you can do

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,800
until uh until we can hire somebody

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
with the right background and that was

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,760
in 1970 and i never quite got out

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,840
um and um a lot of

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
interim steps which spaff alluded to in

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,120
which i'll

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,840
talk a little more about in the

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,800
following slide

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
um as uh as spaff said i joined

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
microsoft in 99

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
uh was primarily responsible for the

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
creation of the security development

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
life cycle process

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
um that did make a a

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
difference in the in the way we looked

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
at building

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,879
secure systems uh and retired from

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,319
from microsoft and 15 started working at

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,440
safe code

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
in 16 safe code is a is a small

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
non-profit

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
members are companies in the industry

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
they all have uh secure development

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,959
processes

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
similar to the security development

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
lifecycle and

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,239
so as executive director i try to sort

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,360
of provide

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
uh strategic and technical guidance

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
this presentation isn't about

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,799
sdl or things that

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
i i've normally given given talks about

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
a lot um instead more for

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,319
you know sort of new folks in the field

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,959
or

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
folks who are trying to learn some of

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
the background or or

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,358
history or other considerations

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
it's focused on mistakes things that i

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
did

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
that i wish i hadn't done or wish i

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
hadn't done as much of

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
over the last 50 years and maybe

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
maybe that maybe that tells you

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,160
something about how to think

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,960
about what you're facing and hearing um

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
i'll i'll wrap it up

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
with some some lessons learned and

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,919
suggestions

123
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
and then uh i hope that'll get and i

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
hope i'll do that

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
in time to uh to let you let you get on

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
with your

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
your day and um and and consistent with

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:50,800
the

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
uh with the schedule for the for the

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
class

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,360
um so relevant career history

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
as um as uh as maf said

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
i was with the mitre corporation

134
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
actually i was with mitre from 70

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
to 81 69 to 81

136
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
so these are the times i was working on

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,639
primarily on security

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
um and that was at mitre just from 70 to

139
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
76 i did other things

140
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
before and after that time um

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
81 to 92 with digital equipment

142
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,039
corporation

143
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
uh company doesn't exist anymore um

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
mini computers super mini computers um

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
the the industry took a turn to pcs

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
digital didn't and that was the end of

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
digital

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
trusted information systems um

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
largely a government research contractor

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,639
we built a

151
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
a commercial business went public

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,479
um i was with the company

153
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
got bought out uh by a bigger company in

154
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,240
the

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,960
in the security business in 98 um and

156
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
then microsoft

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
um lives on i talked to those folks

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
they're a safe code member

159
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
but i was there just from 99 to 2015.

160
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
i joined them to run the security

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
response center

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
which was the organization that dealt

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,759
with externally discovered holes

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
in microsoft products and i used a joke

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
that when i joined them in 1999 i was uh

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
i was 20 years old and you're supposed

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,199
to look at my

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,039
appearance now um add 20 to

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,560
the 20 20 to the time since

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,639
since i supposedly since i joined him in

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,600
99

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
and laugh at the aging effects of uh of

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
working for microsoft on vulnerability

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
response back in the day

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
but in fact it was it was an interesting

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
adventure um

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
not really primari primary subject of

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
this this talk

179
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
so let's talk about about some of the

180
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,960
mistakes

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,960
um mistake one

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,599
was um was is is the bella padula model

183
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,759
i don't know whether you've studied

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,360
multi-level security whether you've

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
studied security models

186
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
but bellapadula was one of the earliest

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
security models for dealing with uh with

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,280
with classified information it was

189
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
explicitly driven

190
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,400
by the objective of of meeting

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
the defense department's needs for what

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
they called multi-level security

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
i want a system that can handle

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
both top secret information which is uh

195
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
very sensitive can cause damage to the

196
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,840
national security

197
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
and unclassified information which is

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
is public or close to it and

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
i want users who are only authorized for

200
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
um for unclassified information to

201
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160
to darn sure not be able to uh

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
not be able to access uh classified

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,280
information not be able to access top

204
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
secret information

205
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,199
and so our um our first

206
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
challenge when we started thinking about

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
that um

208
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
that requirement was to figure out well

209
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,120
okay what does that mean

210
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
in precise terms that we could implement

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
with the computer system

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,759
and a couple of uh

213
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
really very good mathematicians named

214
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,880
david bell and len lapadula uh

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,440
both of whom are now members of the

216
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
national cyber security hall of fame

217
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
um tackled that problem

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
and they came up with a mathematical

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
model

220
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,360
um whose effects i've tried to

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
illustrate with the with the graphic

222
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
here

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,640
you have top secret files you have

224
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,279
unclassified files

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
you have top secret cleared user or

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,120
process and an unclassified user or

227
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
process

228
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
and the rules of the model and we'll

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
give you the mathematics

230
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
are that the unclassified user can read

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
or write

232
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
the unclassified mob file and the

233
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
top secret user or process and reader

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
write the top secret

235
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,040
but can only read uh only read

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,839
the unclassified file and so that gives

237
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,240
you

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
sharing of information that's consistent

239
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
with the dod model for

240
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
uh for information security and it also

241
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,279
has the effect

242
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
which is important in building a real

243
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
computer system

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,519
that even if the top secret user top

245
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,000
secret

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
process is running um

247
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
a trojan horse some some very

248
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
untrustworthy software um it can't take

249
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,720
the top secret

250
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
and disclose it down into an

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
unclassified file

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
and um and and and and

253
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,079
you know then south out the internet or

254
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
out the door in somebody's pocket

255
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,120
um and do harm to national security so

256
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
at the time

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
that was you know that was the

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
requirement set

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
and the model was a was a major

260
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
breakthrough

261
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,160
it wasn't the first uh um

262
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
security model that attempted to address

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,399
multi-level security

264
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
but it was um it was the first

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
that was resistant at a model level

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,320
uh to this to this threat from trojan

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
horse programs

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
um and if you so if you built a system

269
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,040
right that enforced that model um it was

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
it was pretty useful and a pretty

271
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
significant breakthrough

272
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
and we actually built it into a

273
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
time-shared multi-system

274
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
that was used at an air force data

275
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
center in the pentagon

276
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
and i believe there were there were

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
other multi-systems in the defense

278
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
department that probably used the model

279
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
as well and it worked

280
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
quite okay there the users

281
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
were happy with it they shared

282
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
information they shared programs

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,240
um and and it was it was usable in that

284
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
context

285
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
of a 70s time sharing system

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
i believed as i say here that it was a

287
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
general solution for multi-level

288
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
security

289
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,839
you know if you've got a system uh if

290
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
you've got a requirement for a system

291
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
that's going to climb

292
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
handle classified information about

293
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,839
lepage

294
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
bellapadulis your answer

295
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
turned out that bellapagela wasn't your

296
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
answer

297
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,120
um in practice there were too many

298
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,079
reasons

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
to violate the the requirements of the

300
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
model

301
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,120
um what's an example

302
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,639
well i i get a i

303
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
i'm logged in at top secret cruising

304
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,240
along

305
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
and i get an unclassified email and i

306
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
want to reply to it

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
okay so now i have to log out

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
log in as an unclassified user and then

309
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,000
i can

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,160
reply but from top secret i can't

311
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
i can't i can compose a reply but when i

312
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
click send back to the unclassified user

313
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
the the model enforcement is going to

314
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
say nope you can't do that

315
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
and in the real world what we did was

316
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,320
wound up

317
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
was wind up inventing pop-up fatigue

318
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
um anybody remember windows vista and

319
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,839
the uh

320
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
um the the allow or deny

321
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
permission when when people wanted to

322
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
install new software

323
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
well that was a very similar model

324
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
called the biba integrity model

325
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
working its way with a highly

326
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
interactive uh

327
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,519
highly interactive system with real

328
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,880
world users

329
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
um i i remember seeing um

330
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
a male system that was running the bell

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
of agile model

332
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,000
where you know where we had users just

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
sort of constantly clicking okay

334
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,639
clicking okay

335
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
clicking okay and you know and that

336
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,839
clicking okay

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,240
says there's not actually any top secret

338
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
information going down there

339
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,480
and you know and and if if people have

340
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,519
to do that

341
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
once a minute or more often there's no

342
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,440
way they're exercising judgment they're

343
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
just clicking okay

344
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
so uh good idea didn't stand

345
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
uh couldn't couldn't really withstand uh

346
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
interaction with with the real world

347
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,760
um mistake two

348
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,959
was kind of a compound on

349
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,079
on mistake on miss on on bella padula

350
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
the defense department i think staff

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
referred to the orange book

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,160
the defense department built

353
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,160
liked ballon lapajola and they built it

354
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
um as a core tenet of

355
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
their orange book security evaluation

356
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
criteria

357
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
of the of the 1980s um

358
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
and so uh there were various levels of

359
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,720
systems that

360
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
uh that that you could build depending

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
on how much

362
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
effort you put into enforcing the rules

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
and making the system secure

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,040
um at the highest level you

365
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,839
uh you had you had to implement the bell

366
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,199
of agile model

367
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,959
and you had to do that with high

368
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
assurance formal formal specification

369
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
formal verification

370
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,079
i sold digital equipment corporation on

371
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,920
the proposition that we needed to be in

372
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
that security market

373
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
and so what we should do was build an a1

374
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,079
system a system that was as secure

375
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,639
as dod knew how to evaluate um

376
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
and we actually built

377
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,120
um a virtual machine monitor um

378
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
for the vax architecture uh super super

379
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
mini computers

380
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
that um that implemented below padula

381
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
uh used a virtual machine monitor

382
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
architecture to minimize the amount of

383
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,760
software that we had to trust

384
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
and still because it was a vmm

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
still provided compatibility with um

386
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
with the existing user operate

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
user code and operating systems that ran

388
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,720
on the vaxxed architecture

389
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,680
so here's a little sketch uh from a from

390
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
a paper

391
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,720
you you've got multiple virtual machines

392
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,000
one at top secret one

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
secret one and unclassified some of them

394
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,920
running vacs

395
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
vms some of them running the the ultrix

396
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
operating system which was dex unix

397
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,519
we got that for free the minimal

398
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,639
mechanism was all

399
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,199
in the the vmm the virtual machine

400
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,079
monitor

401
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,560
security kernel users connected through

402
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
that

403
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
and if you had to uh you know if you had

404
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
to switch from top secret uh

405
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,959
to unclassified uh we gave him an easy

406
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
way to do that

407
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
um so it was pretty cool uh

408
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,240
we built it um we got it to the point

409
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
where we were actually able to uh to dog

410
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
food it to self-host it

411
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,920
in our development group and we were

412
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
doing the uh

413
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,959
the svs development on

414
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
svs systems uh which is sort of a test

415
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
of whether you've got a system or not

416
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,360
um and and that was all that was all

417
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
pretty cool

418
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
um but there were some

419
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,920
some real world problems um

420
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
the you know the as i've shown show on

421
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
this slide

422
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,720
um the development wasn't easy uh we

423
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
were trying to minimize

424
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,319
the trusted code um the uh

425
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,039
performance bmm performance is is a

426
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
potential problem in any case

427
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
um and the the vax wasn't really

428
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
designed to be

429
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,640
virtual machine monitor friendly

430
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
i think that systems like vmware

431
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
today offer

432
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
implements and technologies that might

433
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,840
either have been not

434
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,760
viable the machine's as slow as the

435
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,880
boxes were

436
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
or or we just didn't have them um and

437
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,559
then

438
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
uh the uh the the the performance the

439
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,799
the security evaluation process for our

440
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,080
secure system was what i would call

441
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,160
adversarial um the

442
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
the uh evaluation people got points for

443
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,760
a fine

444
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
you know for making us fail not for

445
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
making us succeed

446
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
and so that was that was interesting

447
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
uh all those things said we ran well

448
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
behind schedule

449
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
i don't think we ran over budget because

450
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
we uh we

451
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
always had trouble getting enough people

452
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,960
you know just hiring enough people to

453
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
work on the thing

454
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,440
um but we eventually got the system done

455
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
enough to be in beta test um and some of

456
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
the users liked it

457
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
but in general users had moved on um

458
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
they they wanted pcs this was the late

459
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,360
80s they wanted pcs they wanted networks

460
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,320
they wanted graphical user interfaces

461
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
and what we had was a terminal time

462
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
sharing system

463
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
that was really compact worked really

464
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,280
well compatible with the technologies

465
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
that you had in the mid-80s

466
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,400
and so you know my characterization is

467
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
nobody wanted a system that

468
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,520
secure or more accurately nobody wanted

469
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
a system

470
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
nobody wanted to pay in performance and

471
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
usability

472
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
the price of a system that's secure and

473
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,640
i wound up canceling the project

474
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
in uh in 1990

475
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,039
um one of the one of the sadder days of

476
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
my life

477
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
but but clearly the right decision

478
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,960
is if we had continued to build it we

479
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
wouldn't have sold enough

480
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
and we would have lost a ton of money uh

481
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,559
trying to enhance it

482
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,080
and uh and and support it over the years

483
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
uh i can answer more questions about

484
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,320
about the cancellation decision um and

485
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,480
uh and what i mean by losing more money

486
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,360
um when we when we get to the to the end

487
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,760
if

488
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,480
you're interested um so that was that

489
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,440
was mistake

490
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,400
two um you know sort of closely linked

491
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,720
to

492
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,240
uh to the bellapadula mistake

493
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,039
and and doubling down to make a bigger

494
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,799
and more expensive mistake

495
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,039
after an another another

496
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,080
um another product of that same deck

497
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,480
era was what we call the desnik

498
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
the digital ethernet secure network

499
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
controller

500
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,159
dec had adopted ethernet in the mid 80s

501
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
and i assume you've studied ethernet

502
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
you know it's basically one a single

503
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,679
shared medium

504
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
anybody can transmit or receive on that

505
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
medium

506
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
and without without encryption you know

507
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
anybody can hear

508
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
hear what anybody else is saying or

509
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
anybody can spoof what

510
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,400
anybody else claims to be saying

511
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,559
our deck product family at the time

512
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,919
used at least a couple of transport

513
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
protocols

514
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,240
one of them was dec net which was dex

515
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,880
proprietary

516
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
networking protocol for connecting its

517
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,280
own products together

518
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,760
another was lat which was stood for

519
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
local area terminal protocol

520
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,880
and it was used to connect uh

521
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,080
servers that were users dialed in or

522
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,039
connected with dot

523
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
dom terminals um connect the terminal

524
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
servers to uh

525
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
to time shared timeshared mini computers

526
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,320
um and so we had multiple transport

527
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
protocols

528
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
running over over ethernet we obviously

529
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
wanted a security solution or we wanted

530
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,520
a security solution

531
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
and what we came up with was that was

532
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
desnik

533
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,039
and desnik this is a drawing from a

534
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,559
from a pat from a from a patent uh

535
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
looked like this you had in encryption

536
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
controller boxes

537
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,039
which weighed about 20 pounds and

538
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,200
supported four nodes each

539
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,679
um and and each of them had enough logic

540
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,559
to keep the individual nodes separated

541
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,280
um

542
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,200
and so uh so information

543
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
uh would flow uh

544
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,440
there's the lost the cursor all right

545
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,919
well then

546
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
information would flow from um

547
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,559
from from uh from an end node say a1

548
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,120
up through encryption controller a then

549
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,880
through the transceiver and onto the

550
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,280
under the network uh down to encryption

551
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
controller n

552
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,960
um and then back to uh back to note n1

553
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
where it would

554
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,720
where where where the encryption folder

555
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,120
in

556
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
would decrypt it and it would uh flow

557
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,559
back and play

558
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,919
next to node n1 um and the four

559
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
i think it was four in nodes per per

560
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,679
controller

561
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
or a way of offsetting the cost of

562
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
building

563
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
this thing in in discrete logic um

564
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,679
we also built a key distribution center

565
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,880
which was basically the same

566
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
controller hardware with slightly

567
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
different software and data

568
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,159
and it would uh establish authorized

569
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
um and keyed connections

570
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
between that allowed say a1 to talk to

571
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
n8 if that was what it wanted to do

572
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,919
um and so it was it was a it was a

573
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
pretty nice solution and it had some

574
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
appeal

575
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,679
um but um

576
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,120
but there's always a bot um

577
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,799
and in in the desnet case it had both uh

578
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,159
what salter would refer to as

579
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
technological and fundamental problems

580
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,600
the the hardware was too costly and we

581
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,720
had performance problems um

582
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
and you know so that was our

583
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
technological problem um

584
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,720
the fundamental problem was that it was

585
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,600
a uh

586
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
you know sort of a solution to the to

587
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:46,960
the wrong

588
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
to the wrong problem the

589
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
deck net was going away terminal

590
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
concentrators were going away

591
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
um all the other vendor proprietary

592
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
networking protocols were going away

593
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
and the world was moving to internet

594
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
protocol and the right answer

595
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,679
would have been a software

596
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,320
implementation of end-to-end encryption

597
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,799
at the ip layer

598
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
which would have been would have been

599
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,760
great but if you said tcpip

600
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
within the bounds of digital equipment

601
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
corporation

602
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,279
that was what what you might think of as

603
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
a career limiting move

604
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
and so uh we really had to do something

605
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
that would work um that would work with

606
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,279
the

607
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,200
with the then deck proprietary protocols

608
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,720
um the desnet

609
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,400
[Music]

610
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
and people did you did in fact use it to

611
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,760
secure

612
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,080
ip networks but it wasn't a real success

613
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
because it was too expensive

614
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840
and had a lot you know basically the uh

615
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,440
protocol independence

616
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
uh drove a solution that just wasn't

617
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,039
wasn't the right one for the time

618
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
so that was that was that was mistake

619
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,840
three

620
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,480
um by the time that

621
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,600
that svs was cancelled and

622
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
and the desnek actually made it to

623
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,200
market um

624
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,240
uh digital as a whole was going into uh

625
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
into a decline um caused

626
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
primarily by their i would i guess i

627
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,919
would say their failure

628
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,039
to pick up on the pc revolution failure

629
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,559
to pick up on uh

630
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,679
graphic workstations quickly enough um

631
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
and maybe their failure to get on board

632
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,120
with

633
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,159
uh without tcp ip networking quickly

634
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,039
enough

635
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,880
and so i left deck in in 92

636
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,799
worked for a couple of years with mitre

637
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,799
again and then joined trusted

638
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,640
information systems in

639
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,039
in 94. trusted information systems

640
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,640
had built with darpa funding um

641
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,880
an application firewall toolkit

642
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,600
it was a it was people didn't refer to

643
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
open source back that long ago

644
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,960
but it was basically an open source

645
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,440
deliverable that we put up on the web

646
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
and anybody could download

647
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
and use to implement a firewall for

648
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
their own use

649
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,360
we retained the rights to productize

650
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,960
gauntlet uh they are the the firewall

651
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,159
toolkit

652
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
and and our product was called gauntlet

653
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
and it was the firewall toolkit

654
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,200
code plus a little management software

655
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,960
um and at various points we uh

656
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
we actually packaged it with hardware so

657
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
you could buy a box

658
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,159
with the firewall uh software pre-loaded

659
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
and somebody would come out and

660
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
configure it for for your installation

661
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,279
um and it would be up and running um it

662
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,840
was reasonably successful

663
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,480
um but in the in the

664
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,159
in the process of of running that prod

665
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,200
uh that product uh i ma

666
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
made a couple of mistakes and they were

667
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,480
both connected

668
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,360
to you know sort of the the fundamental

669
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,480
principles

670
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,880
um of of having um

671
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,440
of having complete mediation and

672
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,840
especially minimal trusted code

673
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
you know we thought that you know if you

674
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,799
didn't have much software you couldn't

675
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,320
make many mistakes

676
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
um and so that would lead to a secure

677
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,399
solution

678
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
um and i made two mistakes both

679
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,760
connected to the sort of minimization

680
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
one of them is i didn't invest soon

681
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,679
enough or deeply enough in a fancy

682
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,399
management graphical user interface

683
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,279
um you know uh you had to go in and

684
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,279
configure the gauntlet firewall

685
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,799
by building ascii text tables

686
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,120
um of who could talk to who and what

687
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,399
node was where

688
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
what the ip addresses were and users

689
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
didn't like that they wanted to point

690
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
and click even by uh

691
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
even by 1994-95 and we didn't have

692
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,120
enough of that

693
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,640
capability soon enough uh specifically

694
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,760
when we ported

695
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,760
um the gauntlet ran on uh on bsd unix

696
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,120
when we ported it to nt uh we

697
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
there was one feature called network

698
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,159
transparency

699
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,880
that would basically let the system

700
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,520
detect

701
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
connectivity without much user

702
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
intervention without configuration

703
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,360
and we getting that on on the unix

704
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
systems was pretty simple

705
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,600
getting it into uh on nt at that time

706
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,120
would have required a complex hack um

707
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,559
that we were loath to do and we went

708
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
back and forth arguing with microsoft

709
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
about giving us an api to make that

710
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,679
function simpler they didn't do it in

711
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,240
the time

712
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
uh um in the in the time frame we needed

713
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,679
and uh so we we went with with manual

714
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,840
configuration uh rather than trying to

715
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,159
build that pack um those two things

716
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
sort of reduce the user usability and

717
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,919
acceptability

718
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,200
of uh of gauntlet and we probably

719
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
weren't enough of a marketing company

720
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
anyway

721
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
but the bottom line was that checkpoint

722
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,360
firewall one

723
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,039
which i think is probably still sold um

724
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,240
had uh had a a a really slick graphics

725
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,200
interface

726
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,919
had better nt support and they ate our

727
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,799
launch

728
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,000
uh the company was was sold about a

729
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
a year after i left and the product

730
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
rattled around the industry

731
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
probably 10 more years and then i think

732
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,679
it's now disappeared from view

733
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,080
so um sad story um

734
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,039
no excuses or maybe maybe maybe

735
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,399
prioritizing

736
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,159
prioritizing a set of security

737
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,600
principles

738
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
at the at the expense of the market was

739
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
a uh

740
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,360
was in retrospect not the right thing to

741
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
do

742
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,120
um another sort of interesting

743
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,480
interesting mistake in

744
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,600
in today's world um

745
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,120
had had to do with uh

746
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,559
with uh what was called a key escrow

747
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,360
system

748
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
i don't know whether you've followed the

749
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
uh

750
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,039
the the debates among uh

751
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,080
fbi justice department and so on and

752
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
uh and the civil liberties and internet

753
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,520
community

754
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,480
about law enforcement access to

755
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
encrypted information

756
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,960
but that debate has been around for

757
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
almost 30 years now

758
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,399
um and it started with a system

759
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,399
called clipper which um

760
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,840
was uh was a uh

761
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,440
actually it was a secure voice uh device

762
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,360
that sat between a telephone and the uh

763
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
and the wire i know it sat between

764
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
telephone handset and the telephone

765
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,919
and provided encryption but did it in

766
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,960
such a way

767
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
that there was an extra key involved

768
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
that was held by a couple of government

769
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,720
agencies and could be recovered

770
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
to break your encrypted communications

771
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,120
if the government decided it needed to

772
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,480
do that

773
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,919
um and that was was controversial

774
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
tis was pro crypto

775
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,640
export they thought that people should

776
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
have uh access to encryption

777
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,600
uh worldwide um thought that um

778
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,640
thought that um that that the export

779
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,159
controls were bad thought that the

780
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
clipper chip was bad

781
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
um and our ceo the late steve walker

782
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
asked me to invent a way

783
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,799
to invalidate a couple of government

784
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,600
claims namely that you the only way to

785
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
meet their requirements

786
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,559
was to uh use a non-public algorithm

787
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,559
implemented in hardware

788
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,399
and um and and to

789
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,519
and and to use um yeah those are the

790
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,440
requirements the non-public algorithm

791
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
and a hardware implementation and so i

792
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,279
came up

793
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,480
with a solution that implemented that

794
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
could be implemented in software

795
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,960
met the stated government requirements

796
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,039
and still provided

797
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,320
uh key escrow access

798
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
and a level of security for

799
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,360
for users within that context

800
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
when that happened when i came up with

801
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,279
that solution

802
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,960
our ceo who had previously been um

803
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,039
pro crypto export opposed to the clipper

804
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,440
chip decided that hey

805
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
maybe there's a market commercial market

806
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,840
for kiev for a key escrow solution

807
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,279
we'll sell it and so

808
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,919
uh we invested significant resources

809
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,679
um in building and selling a key escrow

810
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,440
solution actually one of the versions

811
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,679
was was added to the gauntlet firewall

812
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,840
with the aim of meeting customers needs

813
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,880
for being able to export encryption and

814
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,840
still having

815
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,919
having government license because the

816
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,080
government could could intercept

817
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,840
there's more to the story than that but

818
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,279
i think that's enough to give you a

819
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,240
sense of what

820
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,880
happened and um

821
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
in in the ensuing scuffle um

822
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
the investment distracted the company

823
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,760
from the gauntlet business

824
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,799
so we didn't we didn't invest as much

825
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,840
in in in graphical user interface or

826
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,320
uh ent implementation as we probably as

827
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
we should have

828
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,120
and then um after arguments back and

829
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
forth with civil liberties groups in the

830
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,399
industry and so on

831
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,440
the government abandoned the uh the key

832
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
escrow mandate

833
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,040
and that would although we claimed that

834
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,639
there were commercial needs

835
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,440
for key escrow uh the fact of the matter

836
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
is that you know once the government

837
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,760
abandoned

838
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,159
the escrow mandate all the customers and

839
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,879
um

840
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
and resellers abandoned the kiosk grow

841
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,199
mandate and we were left with six

842
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,560
patents but no uh but no income

843
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,040
uh so a less a lesson learned there

844
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,719
um in the process

845
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,839
final final mistake

846
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
is i think of as much more recent this

847
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,119
is the only mistake

848
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,879
that i'm going to associate with with

849
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,320
microsoft

850
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,000
um in 2002

851
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,359
um we we you know after

852
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,880
after some real the you know disasters

853
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
or at least

854
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
you know major embarrassments associated

855
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
with the security of windows software

856
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,200
um we took the entire windows division

857
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,400
and stood them down

858
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,599
gave them all training on

859
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,720
what we understood then to be

860
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,839
secure development

861
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,599
and then then

862
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,079
you know we we trained them uh for a

863
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,200
half a day

864
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
you know each every engineer got a half

865
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,560
day training

866
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
uh there are about 8 500 engineers sent

867
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
them off to

868
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,680
try to improve the security of the

869
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,839
product

870
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,960
and a lot of that worked very well

871
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
but one of the things that our training

872
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
tried to do

873
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
was to teach our project in product

874
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,760
engineers

875
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
to think like hackers and find

876
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
vulnerabilities and invent attacks

877
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,800
and it turned out

878
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,359
that a few could a few of those 8500

879
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,960
could

880
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,200
but both couldn't um and so

881
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,560
our our investment in teaching them to

882
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,240
think like a hacker

883
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,880
to invent new vulnerabilities from

884
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
scratch

885
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,599
really didn't work fortunately we had

886
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,720
other things

887
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,359
like running static analysis tools

888
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,359
looking for specific code patterns that

889
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,078
we taught them

890
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,440
building specific kinds of tests looking

891
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
at specific

892
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,760
uh configurations doing what what we

893
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,359
call threat modeling that's another

894
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,320
story

895
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,520
those did work so overall um

896
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
there were there were certainly benefits

897
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,560
from it

898
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,160
but um but we we assumed

899
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,800
that we could teach all our developers

900
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
to think like hackers and they'd all

901
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
find new classes of vulnerabilities

902
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,599
by understanding what a vulnerability

903
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,560
was

904
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,119
uh and that that just didn't that just

905
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
didn't pay off

906
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,240
we didn't get a payoff and

907
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
vulnerabilities

908
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
that corresponded to the effort people

909
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,640
should pay

910
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,720
uh put on it and they should have been

911
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,000
paying more putting more

912
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
effort on uh code reviews for for known

913
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,359
bad

914
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,320
patterns um either manually or with the

915
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
static analysis tools

916
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,079
so another lesson learned

917
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,200
so here's here's sort of the bottom line

918
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,880
that i've taken away from those um

919
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,000
from those uh 50 or so

920
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,760
years of of of more mistakes

921
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,560
i'm not sure more more mistakes than i'd

922
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
care to admit i guess i just admitted

923
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,040
them

924
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,839
uh you know the the customer's right

925
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,839
um even if the even even if

926
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,079
if you think the customer is wrong from

927
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,960
a security

928
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,760
fundamentals or what what he or she

929
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,320
should be

930
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,440
wanting um the customer gets to

931
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,320
decide whether they use your tech

932
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
technology or not

933
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,119
and that's um and that that turns out to

934
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,079
be really

935
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,920
really important i mean it sounds sort

936
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,119
of stupid to say

937
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,800
but when you're a security person you

938
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,160
think security

939
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,720
is is the thing that it's about and if

940
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
the customer doesn't agree

941
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,160
and you can't convince them then then

942
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,720
that's not going to end well for you

943
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,560
um usability is important i know people

944
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,920
spend a lot of time now on on trust use

945
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
user experience and secure usability

946
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
um and that you know that's that's a

947
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,359
that's a good thing

948
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,680
um it's something that i think the uh

949
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,000
the security field came to light

950
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
and is is very important um

951
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
security isn't everything i think i just

952
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,760
said that and talking about customers

953
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
um it's it's a balance um

954
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,920
something that i've learned a couple of

955
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
times both with the orange book

956
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,760
and and with the key escrow exercise

957
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,520
is that the government is

958
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,800
perfectly capable of promising you

959
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
that they're going to go in a certain

960
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
direction and that their standards and

961
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,839
requirements are going to create a

962
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,000
market

963
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,640
and the government is also perfectly

964
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,520
capable

965
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,839
of changing its mind or backing off or

966
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,200
granting waivers

967
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,280
so you really want to think carefully

968
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
before you decide that a government

969
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,640
security requirement

970
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,240
is going to create a market that you're

971
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,680
going to fulfill

972
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,480
um you know that's not that's not

973
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,079
guidance for government contractors

974
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,800
obviously

975
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,760
you know if they're paying you a

976
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
contract they're paying you a contract

977
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,160
but

978
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,599
if you're trying to build a commercial

979
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,520
product based on a government rent

980
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
mandate that may or may not end well and

981
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
you need to really think

982
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
you know how am i going to sell this

983
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
even if uh even if the

984
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,280
if the government changes its mind

985
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,760
time to market um is better than perfect

986
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,480
uh if you're fooled with security long

987
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
enough

988
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,560
it may have moved on and you may have

989
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,920
the best buggy weapon

990
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,000
in kansas or something and then finally

991
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,319
um think about what your your

992
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,000
organization

993
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
uh norms are

994
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,079
telling you as you're trying to build a

995
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,359
solution

996
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,040
um the norm at trust at uh

997
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,400
digital equipment was uh was

998
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,520
uh dec net and lat you know their

999
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
proprietary protocols

1000
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,760
and the and the reality was we would

1001
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
have been better off with

1002
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,800
with ip the norm at

1003
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,920
tis was uh was

1004
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,960
was small you know small simple minimal

1005
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,000
code

1006
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,119
uh trust at all cost um and we would

1007
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,480
have been better off

1008
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,640
building a hack for transparent for

1009
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
transparent firewall access

1010
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,960
and building a big complex gui that

1011
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,839
people

1012
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,839
liked and would use to configure their

1013
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,119
firewalls

1014
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,480
so uh so a lot of a lot of challenges

1015
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,920
as you're as you're planning and

1016
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
strategizing uh

1017
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,960
to to do something that is successful

1018
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,839
and and my definition of success is

1019
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,160
really something that people will use

1020
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,560
that will help them get better security

1021
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,440
not something

1022
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
uh not something perfect that maybe

1023
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,599
maybe nobody wants

1024
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,560
so with that um i think i'm a little

1025
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
longer than i had hoped to be

1026
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,359
but uh got some time for questions and

1027
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,640
smash said

1028
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,480
that it's the last slaughter you don't

1029
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
have to walk to your next class

1030
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
so if we stop now let's take some

1031
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,040
questions

1032
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
can you see the question and answer

1033
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,720
window there

1034
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,240
steve or would you like to open it okay

1035
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
how did how does how did how did okay

1036
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,920
somebody asked

1037
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
how to i'll do i'll do these

1038
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,520
i'll do these unless we get overwhelmed

1039
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,480
at which point

1040
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
you know we you know i'll punt it punt

1041
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,839
it to you folks

1042
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,000
um how does bellapadula deal with

1043
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,599
compartments those technically would be

1044
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,200
pure levels above

1045
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,319
uh top secret um so

1046
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,440
um the

1047
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,480
um it's a lattice is the is

1048
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,920
is the the answer uh so you deal with

1049
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
um you you deal with the security levels

1050
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,200
as um you know thing as as integers

1051
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,240
with a less than greater than comparison

1052
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,839
and you deal with uh with compartments

1053
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,040
as uh as um

1054
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,960
as binary attributes they're there or

1055
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
not and you deal with them by set

1056
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,079
inclusion

1057
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,119
so uh uh top secret

1058
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,640
um apple banana dominates

1059
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,680
secret banana top secret

1060
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,359
um top secret apple banana

1061
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,400
and secret cherry are incomparable

1062
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
um is is that is that is that

1063
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
is that an answer i don't know whether i

1064
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,359
know whether people

1065
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,440
can answer can talk back or whether they

1066
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,400
have to uh

1067
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,359
to type their questions but but if you

1068
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,119
if you can if you can talk

1069
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
if you can talk and you have uh

1070
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,280
want follow-up uh you know either type

1071
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,240
or hauler

1072
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
thank you i was just uh typing the um

1073
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,599
question but

1074
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,240
yeah so basically you're saying that um

1075
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,520
if i needed to

1076
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,319
move a piece or copy or make a piece of

1077
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,000
information available in more than one

1078
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,920
compartments that would be equivalent to

1079
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,880
applying an additional label to it right

1080
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,160
it's it if you

1081
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,240
if it the the compartment the

1082
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,760
compartments are

1083
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,680
are um or our orthogonal

1084
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,560
um departments are orthogonal to the the

1085
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,000
security levels

1086
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,680
and they're you know they're a set of

1087
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,280
individual attributes

1088
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,720
and you can um and you know to

1089
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,920
to read to read to read a uh

1090
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
to read a document or an object with uh

1091
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,319
with with compartments uh compartment

1092
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,440
compartments associated with it you have

1093
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,560
to have all those compartments on your

1094
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,319
uh on your process yeah and basically

1095
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,880
if if i needed to have information from

1096
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,839
one compartment

1097
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,680
accessible in another compartment that

1098
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
would require an external it would not

1099
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,040
be the user doing that but it would be

1100
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,280
an external force that would basically

1101
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,359
change the label or add an additional

1102
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,800
label right yeah that's

1103
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,160
that if right if you if you know

1104
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,040
let's say let's say if i have top secret

1105
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,800
top secret apple banana

1106
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
and i want to share information derived

1107
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,640
from that with somebody who

1108
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,240
who only has access to secret and cherry

1109
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,720
you know that's a case that i was

1110
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,839
talking about

1111
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,520
you know when i was talking about the

1112
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
the model you know you you have to

1113
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,319
you have to drill a hole in the model

1114
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,680
somehow to get that

1115
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,000
information through yep yep got it got

1116
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,040
it thank you

1117
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,960
okay other other questions

1118
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,480
let's see that i've got oh okay

1119
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
um yeah all right

1120
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,920
um yeah somebody bill malik who is

1121
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
the name i remember from the past in a

1122
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,280
sense the government didn't

1123
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,480
abandon the kioskrow

1124
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,240
initiative so much as redirect the

1125
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,598
funding to crypto ig

1126
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,319
that's a different story bill

1127
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,839
other other questions

1128
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,240
well um i'll uh

1129
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,720
i'll pop in here and um uh

1130
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,640
ask if you could say a couple words

1131
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
about

1132
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,119
what safe code is doing now uh and what

1133
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,040
you're enabling in the community

1134
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,760
because you've you've retired but you've

1135
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,280
not you're still at it so

1136
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,839
okay so so safe code is an organization

1137
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,359
been around for about 15 years and

1138
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,200
we really do two things at this point

1139
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,560
one of them is that we

1140
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,000
we have our members work together

1141
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,200
to share best practices and techniques

1142
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,079
for building secure building software

1143
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,280
securely

1144
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,800
um you know you know what what kind of

1145
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
what kind of testing approaches um what

1146
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,440
kind of training

1147
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,720
um you know can we can we work together

1148
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,280
to build training developer training

1149
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,839
that then

1150
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,800
we can then use all use across the

1151
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,880
member organizations

1152
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,960
and the other thing that we do pretty

1153
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,319
closely coupled

1154
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,119
is that a lot of what we do is aim not

1155
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,359
only for sharing among the members

1156
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,400
but we make that public so

1157
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,079
if you go to the safe code website

1158
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,319
um there's a series of blog posts

1159
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,760
that are basically an introduction and

1160
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,319
recommendations

1161
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,520
and trade-offs about using fuzzing tools

1162
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,960
to improve uh

1163
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,400
product security there's another series

1164
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,800
that's uh underway as a matter of fact

1165
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,880
i'm i'm delinquent reviewing

1166
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,920
the next couple of posts about the

1167
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,119
transition to post quantum encryption

1168
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,640
um there's a series um

1169
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,920
that's that's going on about uh

1170
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
developer training what kind of training

1171
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,200
the do developers need and how do you

1172
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,079
how do you

1173
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,480
how do you get and deliver that there's

1174
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,680
a series

1175
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,839
uh from about a year ago about

1176
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,480
organizing security

1177
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,960
champions basically people in a product

1178
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,599
group

1179
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,720
for the security advocates for uh for

1180
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,200
for building uh for building products

1181
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,240
securely

1182
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,760
uh so a lot of uh a lot of of different

1183
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,880
topics

1184
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,720
all associated with soft buildings

1185
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,400
software securely um and most of them

1186
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,920
uh shared with the community uh

1187
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,079
anybody basically anybody who wants to

1188
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,480
uh who wants to download them or read
