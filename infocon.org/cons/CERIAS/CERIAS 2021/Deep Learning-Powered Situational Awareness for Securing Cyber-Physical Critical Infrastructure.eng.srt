good afternoon

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
sorry i mute

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
and thank you very much for the

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
opportunity for sharing some of our work

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
in our research lab today i would like

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
to present some of our work on deep

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
learning powered situational awareness

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
for securing cyber physical critical

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,480
infrastructures

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,440
due to the advances of sensing computing

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
and networking more and more several

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
components and physical systems has been

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
combined with each other for different

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
operations in different critical

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
infrastructures such as smart

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
manufacturing infrastructure smart

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
energy system and smart transportation

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
systems

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
those tight cyber physical coupling

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,840
dramatically improve the effectiveness

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
and efficiency of the different

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
operations in those different critical

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
infrastructures however at the same time

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,520
it also raises a series of unfamiliar

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
attack surface and results in the

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
increased vulnerability of the

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
operations to the potential separate

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
attacks and the physical failures

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,600
different research and solutions have

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
been developed effectively to mitigate

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,119
those several physical attacks in those

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
critical infrastructures in order to

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,399
enhance the security and resilience

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
however they still remain some

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,719
challenges in the real application

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,200
operations

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
so those kind of challenges have been

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
demonstrated in the different

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
real world attacks occurred nowadays for

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,599
example in 2015 there's several attacks

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
occurred in the power system in ukraine

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,400
this power system has resulted in a

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
large scale power outage this attack was

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
launched on the computer and the scalar

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
system of the regional electricity

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
distribution company and resulted in the

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,360
disconnection of seven substations for

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,920
three hours and the first operators to

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
switch to manual mode so there's another

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
attack occurs in the

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
water treatment facility in florida in

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,800
201st

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
due to the

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
investigation this attack occurred about

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
15 miles away from the location of the

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,800
facility and the two days before the

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,599
super bowl this cyber attack managed to

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,040
adjust the levels of a sodium hydroxide

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,319
from 100 parts per million to once

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,000
eleven thousand and one hundred parts

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
per million luckily this attack was

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
about and terminated by the operator of

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
the facility in time we can imagine if

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,879
this

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,840
this attack succeeded we can potentially

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
cause very severe

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
safety related accidents

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,080
so we can see it is really emergent and

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,799
it's very critical to

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,840
achieve

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
the work improve the security and

85
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,799
related

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
solutions in order to enhance the

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
resiliency and security of the critical

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
infrastructures

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
in the light of those challenges and the

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
demands our cyber physical social system

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
design like aims to leverage the deep

92
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
learning technology to provide

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
and achieve the deep learning power the

94
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
situational environment solutions for

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
securing the separate physical critical

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
infrastructures

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
so in this talk i would like to present

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
some of our work aligned with three

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
research directions first deep learning

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,439
based architecture for detecting cyber

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
attacks and physical failures second

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
attack resilient communication

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
infrastructures and the last

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
value-inspired intelligent

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,160
decision-making under control

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
so first deep learning-based

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
architecture for detecting cyber attacks

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
and physical failures

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
thanks to the advances of sensing and

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
computing deep learning techniques has

111
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
been widely and successfully applied in

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
the security domain and provide a series

113
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
of promising solutions for achieving a

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
timely situation awareness however there

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
still remains some essential challenges

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
to achieve the more practical solution

117
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
for addressing the real world problems

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
for example the security related data is

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
very limited especially device

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
associated with some very happened

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
security related incidents

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
and also those data is a sparsely

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
labeled because labeling and the

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
achievement annotation of the data can

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
be very time consuming and the labor

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,680
haven't

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
and also thus in recent years many

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
evidence have been shown that the

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
decision making of the machine learning

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
model

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
can be misled and

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
because of some carefully crafted the

133
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
preservation or adversarial

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,120
perturbations in order to address those

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
challenges

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
they provide or i talk about the two

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
solutions have been provided in our

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,280
research lab first the hybrid reach

139
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
provision based on research by

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
exploiting human domain knowledge and

141
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
second blockchain enable decentralized

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,840
secure situational warning system the

143
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,680
first the hybrid weak supervision based

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
on myself this aim to address the first

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,800
challenge viscosity of label the data

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
this architecture provides overview of

147
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
our proposed method we can see here

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
consists of three main learning

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
primary learning model secondary

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
learning model and latent feature

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
learning model the primary learning

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
model designed aimed to extract the

153
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
features from the limited label the data

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
and interact with other two learning

155
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639
models the second learning model is

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
designed to interact with the primary

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
learning model and to extract the

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
critical features from the unlabeled

159
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
data that is consistent with the

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
features from the labeled data

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
and the latent feature learning model is

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,319
the critical component in our work it's

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,120
aimed to interact with the primary model

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,319
and the second learning model

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
accordingly in order to seamlessly

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
integrate the domain knowledge with the

167
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
separate features presented by the data

168
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,479
directly

169
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,440
by doing that we are able to achieve

170
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
appropriate and reliable decision making

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
for situational awareness even the

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
system only have the limited data has a

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
very limited um or which is sparsely

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
labeled

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
and yeah they also provide another

176
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
solution blockchain enable decentralized

177
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
and the secure situation environment

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
system

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
this will aim to address the other two

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,440
challenges first the lack of valuable

181
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,400
data and security of motion learning

182
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
so this one provides the overview of our

183
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599
provost structure so the main idea here

184
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,840
is we designed this blockchain to enable

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
the decentralized corporation

186
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
architecture so that the different

187
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
computing units they can have very

188
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,280
limited computing power limited data and

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
even untrust diversity to each other but

190
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
they are able to collaborate with each

191
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
other in a secure and privacy preserving

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
way to solve the associated tasks

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
so those computing nodes

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
can participate in this collaboration by

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
playing about the three functions

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
application initiator computing

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
contributors or verification

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
contributors if the nodes or the

199
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
computing units play as the application

200
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
initiator it will announce the learning

201
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
driven or data-driven situational

202
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
various tasks via this a

203
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,800
blockchain-based middleware and they

204
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
will specify their objectives and

205
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
constraints of the task

206
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,160
via the blockchain smart contract and

207
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
submit the necessary training and

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
testing data and the decentralized and

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,879
secure data storage systems

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
and the computing contributor if they

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,199
would like to participate this task will

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
join their local learning model based on

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,000
their private local data or the data

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,719
shared by the application initiator

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
according to the objectives and the

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
constraints shared by the application

217
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
initiator via the blockchain smart

218
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,720
contract

219
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
after those local learning model trained

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
and claimed about the blockchain-based

221
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,240
middleware the randomly selected

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,959
verification contributors will conduct a

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,519
quantity verification procedure to

224
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
evaluate the trustworthiness of the

225
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
claimed local learning model and inform

226
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
the application initiator with their

227
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
decision making if the majority of the

228
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
verification contributor have the

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
positive decision-making the transaction

230
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,560
of this local learning model will be

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,040
established between the associated

232
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
computing contributors and the

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
application initiator and after

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
achieving the local learning model from

235
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
the different computer contributors the

236
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,399
application initiator be able to conduct

237
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
multi-modal and

238
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
fusion mechanism to achieve the metal

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
model to solve those challenges

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
situational wireless tasks

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
this work has been developed in a nasa

242
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
project and in this project we are able

243
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,560
to

244
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
establish a hardware in the loop

245
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
prototype for this architecture and

246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
evaluate the performance in the nasa

247
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
deep space exploration tasks and other

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
related tasks and the performance is

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
successful factory and currently we're

250
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
still working on improving the

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
performance and efficiency

252
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
so another research is about the attack

253
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,000
resilient communication infrastructure

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
we know the resilient communication

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
infrastructure is very critical for

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
maintaining the appropriate operations

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
in different critical infrastructures

258
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
however sometimes it can be challenging

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,160
to directly leverage the established

260
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
communication infrastructure which were

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
originally established for the other

262
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
commercialized purpose for maintaining

263
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
the operations in the critical

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
infrastructure here identify two of the

265
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
challenges first due to the different

266
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
operating conditions we may need the

267
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
tremendous amount of sensing and

268
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
operation data and the delivery of those

269
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
data may eat the different the quality

270
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,079
of service or production as for short

271
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,839
and the quality of experiences were

272
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
called qoe for short requirements

273
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
second we also need a resilient

274
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
autonomous networking management even in

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
the presence of certainty this is

276
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,160
because of the complexity and the

277
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
critical

278
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,079
property of the critical infrastructure

279
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,360
operations

280
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
and to address this challenge we provide

281
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
two solutions first attack resilient the

282
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
networking middleware mechanism second

283
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,399
the blockchain-powered multi-controller

284
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
software-defined network-based

285
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,920
networking architecture

286
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
first attack resilient networking

287
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
middleware mechanism here show the

288
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,160
overview of our

289
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
architecture we can see in this work we

290
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
develop a deep learning enabled

291
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
middleware architecture which is able to

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
upgrade the established communication

293
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
infrastructure with the low retrofitting

294
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
cost and the meet the requirement of

295
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
operating in the critical infrastructure

296
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
such as power systems

297
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
as shown in this diagram our middleware

298
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
is able to monitor the qrs and the poe

299
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,920
demands of the associated operating

300
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
conditions and evaluate the operation

301
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
condition of the networking in real time

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
and then they are able to achieve a

303
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,920
hierarchical and intelligent

304
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,600
multi-cloud or say the cross-layer

305
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
operations of the communication

306
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,639
infrastructure

307
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
and by leveraging the deep learning

308
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
technique we also able to detect the

309
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,279
potential attacks such as integrity

310
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
attack in the real time and

311
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
realize the mitigation strategy

312
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,800
accordingly so these workers develop a

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,880
qoe project by collaborating with the

314
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
national renewable energy lab we were

315
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,600
able to develop a large scale

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
and hardware in the loop testing system

317
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,839
to evaluate the performance of our

318
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
developed middleware mechanism for

319
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
securing the communication

320
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,560
infrastructure for a large scale

321
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,639
power system with a high penetration of

322
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
cleaves

323
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
so and another solution is blockchain

324
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
powered the multi-controller

325
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
software-defined network-based

326
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,959
networking architecture the overview as

327
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,360
a following we can see our networking is

328
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
relies and managed by multicontroller

329
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
sdn there and the multiple controllers

330
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
will collaborate and operate each other

331
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
via a

332
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
blockchain based layer and this there

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
you ensure the security autonomous

334
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,880
management of the collaboration

335
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
so our proposed networking management is

336
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
able to deliver the functionality of

337
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
integrity verification so here show some

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
details of maintaining something in

339
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
order to meet this goal so we can see if

340
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959
the controller runs on to send a command

341
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,000
to the controller n before they send or

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
instead of sending that directly they

343
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
will generate a combined hedge value

344
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,199
based on the time step of generating of

345
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,959
this command and the content of a

346
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,360
command and this height value will be

347
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,720
archived in the blockchain middleware

348
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
and then when the controller n received

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,519
a command instead of directly deploying

350
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,600
the command they will also generate the

351
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
highest value and compare with the ones

352
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
archived in the the blockchain based

353
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
meter value the other to verify the

354
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
integrity

355
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,600
so by using the functionality of the

356
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,160
blockchain smart contract they're also

357
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,639
able to realize autonomous detection of

358
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,839
malicious hosts to improve the security

359
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,160
and autonomous bandwidth provisioning to

360
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
improve the responsiveness and

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
reliability of the networking management

362
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
so the last work i want to provide some

363
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
overview about is about inspired

364
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
intelligent design making under control

365
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,680
so here i want to try to answer two

366
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,079
essential questions first in order to

367
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
realize the transversely situational

368
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
awareness how can they dynamically model

369
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
in the complex several physical systems

370
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
second how could heterogeneous separate

371
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
physical components be able to cooperate

372
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,560
for securing the operations in order to

373
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
answer those questions smile forward is

374
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
to develop a flocking inspired

375
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
multi-agent resilient control

376
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
this research developed by considering

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
the microgrid is one type of smart

378
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
energy system as a concrete application

379
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,320
domain

380
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,720
so in this work we're leveraging the

381
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
flocking philosophy which comes from the

382
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,639
biology area to formulate the coupling

383
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
the cyber physical coupling between the

384
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,880
different components in the microgrid

385
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
and based on this coupling modeling we

386
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,759
are able to generate a flocking inspired

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
reference model whose output will be

388
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,320
established is

389
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,680
expected

390
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
normal states of the individual

391
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
components in this system

392
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,680
and then another reinforced

393
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
melanin-based situational awareness

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,759
mechanism is able to monitor and detect

395
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
abnormal situation by comparing the real

396
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,240
situation and with the respective states

397
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
generated from this reference model and

398
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
generate autonomous and secure operation

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
accordingly to maintain the stability of

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
this microwave

401
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
so after um

402
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
providing this uh some of our works

403
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
overview i would like to end without my

404
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
talk by providing some final remarks the

405
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
main idea here i want to say is and

406
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
in order to provide a resilient

407
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,279
situational awareness for securing the

408
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,759
critical infrastructure it's difficult

409
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,839
to only focus on one layer such as

410
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
application layer communication layer or

411
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
the

412
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,399
physical layer we really want to

413
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
secure those

414
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
different layers in a collaborative way

415
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
because in the application layer they're

416
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,279
able to provide sensing and environment

417
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
data they really like the leaves of the

418
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,279
tree because they

419
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
directly interact with our situation

420
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,040
awareness provides also data evidence

421
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
and the communication infrastructure is

422
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
like the branch it's really connect with

423
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,760
the and leaves and the tank of the tree

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
so and the last the physical system

425
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
because we really interact with the

426
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
system physical layer and also

427
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,599
potentially will result in the

428
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,959
safety critical situation if another

429
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
operator properly that's why that layer

430
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
is a very essential so my work and our

431
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
research lab work is a focus on how to

432
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
integrate these three layers in order to

433
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
provide a prominent solution thank you

434
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
very much

435
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
professor thank you very much for that

436
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
presentation

437
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,280
thank you

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
you
