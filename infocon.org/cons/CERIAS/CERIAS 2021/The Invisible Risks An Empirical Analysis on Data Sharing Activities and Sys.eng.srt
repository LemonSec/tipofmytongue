00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
working paper it's called the invisible

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
risks

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
the effect of data broker registration

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
on data broker's privacy disclosure

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,720
quality and data breaches

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
so uh just a little bit about me so if

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
you want to know more about me here

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
here's a quick

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
summary and yes i got my phd from purdue

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
in 2009 from kranner

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,959
my major was in mis and i had a minor in

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,000
accounting

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
and you can see i have i'm a certified

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,519
public accountant and a certified

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,519
internal auditor as well

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
uh there are some interesting things i'm

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
also doing several projects with

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
companies

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
in the chicago area um so just to bring

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,599
more like the live professional

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,760
experience to my classroom

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
and then as mentioned earlier that i had

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
a chance to give a talk with the

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,920
institute of internal auditors

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
institute of management accountants i

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,800
will do another one with asaka the

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
computer auditing group as well

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
and then i have a chance to do a one

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
panel panel session with the federal

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,120

and we're also doing training sessions

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
for the company so

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
you can see that it's kind of

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
interesting when we try to link

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
everything with the professional

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
practices

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
so that's about me and then for today if

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
you have

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,959
uh any question please feel free to post

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,440
it on the q a session feel free to use

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,879
the chat

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,120
so we can answer your question uh

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,239
for data brokers we probably have seen

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
a lot of news articles about data

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,519
brokers in recent

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
years right and actually um there's

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
more after we have the facebook scandal

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
uh probably three years ago but

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
every time when we look at it the

107
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
question we may have is

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
so who are these data brokers uh

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
these are actually the the players

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
behind the scenes so that's why

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
we don't really know that there are not

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
actually consumer interactive

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,680
companies so for example if we go to the

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
website we know that oh the website is

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,640
collecting

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
our information the website may be also

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,358
sharing our information

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
but the thing that we don't know it is

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
that there might be another player

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
behind the scene that is also

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
trying to collect a lot of different

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
pieces of information about us so

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,199
for example so this is a nice figure

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
that shows how the data broker collect

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,720
data or purchase the data and how they

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
use it

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
so for example we may sign it to to have

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,680
those free

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
accounts to play those games we may have

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
a free app that we want to use

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
and there comes with some tricks here

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
they may be sharing some information

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
with the data brokers

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
or we may register for a free loyalty

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
cards free membership

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
they may also have the information or

137
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,800
they may

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
actually go through this purchasing

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
behavior route

140
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
so they can understand a lot about our

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
purchasing activities

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,479
so in addition to all this kind of more

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
like the private

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
uh type channel that they can collect

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,440
information

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,840
they can also see a lot of public

147
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,199
information about us

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
right so for example the the information

149
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
we posted or the profile

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
we posted on facebook on instagram on

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
twitter

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
they can see all those pieces of

153
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
information

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
or for example in illinois you will be

155
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
able to check for example

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
you can find the property tax of a

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
specific person

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
you know the owner of the house and of

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,840
course you will have the address you

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
have the zip code

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
so you will be able to get all the

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
demographic information of that

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
area as well and as you can see

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
the data broker can actually get all

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
these pieces of information and

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
sometimes they share with each other as

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
well

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
then they will be able to do a lot of

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
different things for example

170
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
is this person expecting a baby

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
or do they donate to the international

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
charities

173
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,400
or do they prefer specific brand of cars

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
right so they will know a lot of a lot

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,000
of different things about us just by

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
collecting all these pieces of

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
information

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
so uh here are some examples of the

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
types of data brokers

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
uh the marketing and the advertising

181
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,960
ones are the obvious ones for sure

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,039
but they know a lot about us so this

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
will be really helpful for them to do

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
the direct marketing

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
they can be really specific about our

186
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
purchasing activities

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
they they will probably even know that

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
the time that we need to repurchase all

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,319
the toilet papers

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,240
properly right and then there are

191
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
several other things for example of

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
fraud detection

193
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
and the risk communication part

194
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
these are mainly used i think for the

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
financial institutions

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,639
insurance companies credit card

197
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
companies right so for example

198
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,639
when we try to apply for a loan uh they

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
will probably need to verify

200
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
our information they need to know our uh

201
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
the background histories

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
so it's not just about the credit rating

203
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
checking they probably want to verify

204
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
all the pieces of information will

205
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,080
provide to them

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
right so this will be a necessary step

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
for them to to perform the the processes

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
and of course this is part of their risk

209
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
mitigation procedures

210
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
just to verify all the information are

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,240
valid

212
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,319
and they can rely on them for decision

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,440
making

214
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
and of course the data brokers can also

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120
be used for

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
people search sites so if you provide

217
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
specific information they will be able

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
to match and then find for example

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
someone that you probably know about 20

220
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
years ago

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
okay so once they have

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
all these pieces of information and

223
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,280
based on the goal they are trying to

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
achieve

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,319
there are different ways that they can

226
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
make sure that the data is actually more

227
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
useful than it looks like

228
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
right so for example once they have a

229
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
chance to aggregate different pieces of

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,479
information

231
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
something that may not look that useful

232
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
for example we have the zip code we have

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,280
this

234
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
more like the aggregate level

235
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
information once we're able to connect

236
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
it to your personal level information

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,479
that can be really helpful to understand

238
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
the income level the purchasing behavior

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,640
or the preferences right so they can

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
actually enrich this data just by

241
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
aggregating

242
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
a lot of different data set from

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
different dimensions

244
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
right and they can also improve the data

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
quality for example

246
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,880
if you see similar information from

247
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
different dimensions or different

248
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
sources

249
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
that information is probably quite

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
reliable and for you to use for decision

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
making and they also exchange with each

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
other for valuable information they can

253
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
talk to other data brokers

254
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
they actually buy the data from other

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
data brokers

256
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
so they can not just enrich them but

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
also try to

258
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
make sure that they have all the

259
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
valuable information they need

260
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
and of course they can also indirectly

261
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
obtain the information for example

262
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,839
they may work with specific websites so

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,800
they may collect

264
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
all that for example shopping behavior

265
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
browsing behavior

266
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
so they may have a this more like a

267
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
third-party cookie

268
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
when we try to browsing through the the

269
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
websites

270
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,920
so based on all these things they can do

271
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
this will be more useful for them to do

272
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
the decision

273
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
uh here are several a popular data

274
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,000
brokers

275
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
axiom is probably the most famous one

276
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
um and this company actually allows

277
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,240
their

278
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
uh allows each individual users

279
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,240
to go to their website and type in your

280
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
social security number then you will be

281
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,519
able to see

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,920
what kind of information they have about

283
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,959
yourself

284
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,519
okay this company is huge they have

285
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,959
about consumer data

286
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,200
analytics for it's just for marketing

287
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
campaigns and for fraud detection

288
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
we're going to see another figure

289
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,519
actually

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,800
it knows a lot about us okay

291
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
there's a second company it's also about

292
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
they provide information to business

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
to governments but this is mainly about

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
property information so

295
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
about the consumer the financial

296
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
information side and the third one here

297
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
they say that they have the data for

298
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,120
almost

299
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
all the u.s household okay so that's

300
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
kind of scary actually

301
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
and the last one provided they have the

302
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,519
predictive scoring analytics services

303
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,000
this is

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
also for marketers financial service

305
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,680
providers online retailers

306
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
so what kind of information do they

307
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
actually use

308
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,079
here's a nice figure we found on the

309
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,040
website

310
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,079
so this is from action and you can see i

311
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
apologize a little bit

312
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,399
blurry when we try to extract it but you

313
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
can see that it actually knows

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
a lot about us right so for example they

315
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
know the actual number of

316
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
purchases made with a visa credit card

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
in the last 24 months

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
they also know the 45 years of

319
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,079
historical data on them

320
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,040
changes residential history and of

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,680
course

322
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,880
age gender education employment disorder

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
should be easy for them

324
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
they also know whether you have the

325
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
media usage

326
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
of the loans your income level

327
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
they know what kind of vehicle you have

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
they know the properties you have

329
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
and at the bottom of this figure you can

330
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
see

331
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,240
they know the likelihood whether someone

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
in your household is

333
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
expecting a baby or planning to adopt a

334
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
child

335
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
or filing tax in april and on the right

336
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
hand side you can see

337
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
um they know that your religious

338
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
preferences or tendencies they know your

339
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,360
health

340
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
interest right they know your alcohol

341
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,880
tobacco interest as well they also know

342
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
your likelihood that

343
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
someone is a heavy heavy facebook user

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
for example

345
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
or whether you are an influencer on

346
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,839
social media

347
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
or you can be easily influenced by other

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,680
people

349
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
right they also know whether you have a

350
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,839
formal banking relationship

351
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
or you just don't have any major medical

352
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
insurances so they know actually a lot

353
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,800
about this

354
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
about us so that's why they can provide

355
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,760
such information to people or to

356
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
companies that may need it

357
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
you can see that they collect a lot of

358
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
data and this year the data about us

359
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
so although they're more like the

360
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
invisible players in the market

361
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
actually they have been noticed by the

362
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
government

363
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
or federal trade commission starting

364
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,040
from

365
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,560
probably 2012 2013 around that time

366
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,560
here are two articles about a posted by

367
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
about the federal trade commission and

368
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
their perceptions

369
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,519
about the data brokers

370
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
if you have a chance to go through them

371
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,959
you can see that

372
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,760
one of the biggest issue they have is

373
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
transparency

374
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
it seems that we don't really know who

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,560
they

376
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
are we don't really know what kind of

377
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
data they are collecting

378
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
and we don't know how they share or how

379
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
they sell the data to other people

380
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
or who these buyers are we don't really

381
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,279
know

382
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
that right that's one concern and

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
another big concern is that

384
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,399
as we mentioned that for some businesses

385
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
this kind of service is required and

386
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
it's actually a good thing right so for

387
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
example

388
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
uh if we try to apply for the loan they

389
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
can actually help us verify the

390
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,440
information

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
but for federal trade commission their

392
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
concern is more like that

393
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
what happens if this data broker has the

394
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
wrong data

395
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
right so the information is incorrect

396
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,360
and it will actually

397
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
affect all the individuals dramatically

398
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
so they have a concern about whether the

399
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
individuals are able to actually

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
go to them and try to fix it right

401
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,839
so you can see that nowadays we're able

402
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,560
to fix

403
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
or try to submit a request to change the

404
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
data set

405
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
posted or collected by the the credit

406
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,160
companies or

407
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,519
the the experian transunions and equifax

408
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
right so these are all come from this 20

409
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,639
2012 or 2013

410
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
discussion with the federal trade

411
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,920
commission

412
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,839
and it's not just about this federal

413
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
trade commission we can see there are

414
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
tons of

415
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
efforts uh from the regulator's

416
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
perspective so for example uh u.s

417
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
government accountability office

418
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
they say that the data brokers should

419
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,120
report on the practices

420
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
and then the the legislators should

421
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,880
consider

422
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
how we can actually push them to be more

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,519
transparent

424
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
right and the senate committee on

425
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,079
commerce science and transportation

426
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,240
they have also the similar discussion

427
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
about how the data brokers collect

428
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,000
compile and sell customer information

429
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,199
and in 2014 you will see that

430
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
the goal is also about improve the

431
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
transparency

432
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
and the last one is about whether this

433
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
company should actually make

434
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
all this collected information available

435
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
just for the consumers okay in recent

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,120
years

437
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
now we start to see something that is

438
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,639
quite solid

439
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,519
uh so vermont attorney general's office

440
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
there's a new data broker law

441
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,560
it's it was effected on january 1st 2019

442
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,519
so a you meet the definition of the law

443
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
you are required to register within

444
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
vermont's attorney general's office

445
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,160
and then the essay that you need to

446
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
maintain certain minimum data security

447
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,680
standards

448
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,759
because as you can see this is more like

449
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,720
jackpot

450
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
for people who want to obtain all these

451
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,279
pieces of information right

452
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
here's a screenshot of the registration

453
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,199
you can also go to vermont's attorney

454
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,720
general's office

455
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
then you will be able to see all this

456
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,160
list

457
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
i think there are more than 300

458
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
registered data broker on their websites

459
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,680
right now

460
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
and then for each one you can click on

461
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,199
their names

462
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,440
then you will be able to see their

463
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,399
practices

464
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
their information for example this is

465
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
axiom

466
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
they ask a lot of questions for example

467
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,399
whether you have any

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
about mechanisms so they say yes

469
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
people can go to their website then you

470
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,839
can opt out so they won't be able to

471
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,839
collect your information

472
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,000
and down here it says that

473
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
if the about only uh specific to a

474
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,559
specific type of activities which ones

475
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
they say that opt-out is the marketing

476
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,760
part

477
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
okay and then they they do not have this

478
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,119
opt-out

479
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,520
processes if this is for the fraud

480
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
detection part

481
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,799
and is there a question here uh has

482
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,760
there

483
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
we got a question here saying that have

484
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,520
there been any laws

485
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,079
preventing foreign entities from owning

486
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,760
any part of the u.s based data brokers

487
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
that's a question of i don't know the

488
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,600
answer

489
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,679
that's a really good question oh we may

490
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,440
be able to dig further that would be an

491
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
interesting thing to to figure out

492
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,960
right okay so

493
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
it's not just about the opt-out part but

494
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,240
they also

495
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
asked a lot a lot about the data

496
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,120
collection the sales activities

497
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,919
uh or what kind of purchaser

498
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
credentialing processes so do they

499
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
actually verify who is purchasing the

500
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,120
data

501
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
so they actually verify whether this is

502
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
a legit

503
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
a legitimate business before they can

504
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
sell it

505
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
they also talk about the data data

506
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
collection practices

507
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,880
databases sales activities all the

508
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,679
policies

509
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
for minors right so they say that they

510
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,919
do not really disclose any identifiable

511
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,760
data about the miners

512
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
but the miner is actually part of their

513
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
overall household

514
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
information collection processes and

515
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
then they do they have any

516
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,559
uh to provide any concerning uh

517
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,640
about the data collection processes and

518
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
you can see what kind of things they do

519
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,760
for example they review the suppliers

520
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
they actually have some processes to

521
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
ensure the data collection processes is

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
good

523
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
so if you're interested in this you can

524
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,919
actually go to the registration site

525
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
then you will be able to see many of

526
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,000
this kind of interesting data

527
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,720
collection procedures many of them are

528
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,840
private

529
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400
so it would be nice if we can understand

530
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
more about what they are doing with the

531
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,160
data set

532
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
uh for for vermont

533
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
attorney general's office this is how

534
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
they define

535
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
a data broker they say that a data

536
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
broker is a business

537
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
or just part of the business right it's

538
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
a unit or

539
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
it's just part of it but no matter

540
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,799
separately

541
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,760
or together that knowingly collects and

542
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,720
sells

543
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
so you have to do two things you need to

544
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,840
collect it and you need to sell it

545
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
for lots of companies the only thing

546
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,440
they do is collect or

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
buy the data set they are not considered

548
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
as a data broker based on this

549
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,200
definition

550
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
right so they sell to the third parties

551
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
that broker personal information of a

552
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
consumer with whom the business does not

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,039
have a direct

554
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,799
relationship another thing is that

555
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
this cannot happen with the the business

556
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
that have a direct relationship

557
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,360
if their customer is not really broker

558
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
you just need to have your customers

559
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
information

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,760
so that that would be a totally

561
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
different context

562
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,280
and in addition to vermont uh california

563
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
attorney general's office they are also

564
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,159
doing similar things just one year after

565
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
so they also have a regulation that will

566
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,880
be that's effected on january 1st

567
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,919
2020. it's really similar

568
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
uh to vermont's requirements so they say

569
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
that the data brokers

570
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
based on this regulation they need to

571
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,240
disclose the name their physical

572
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
information primary email address

573
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
internet

574
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,159
website addresses and then they need to

575
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,120
talk about

576
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,240
all these data collection practices for

577
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
vermont if you fail to comply

578
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
uh there's a fine about fifty dollars

579
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
per day and then for the whole year it's

580
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
probably ten thousand dollars

581
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
for california it's more like one

582
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
hundred dollars per day plus

583
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,039
all the cost that may be associated with

584
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,720
all kinds of lawsuits

585
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
that you are facing right so there are

586
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,840
some

587
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,280
non-compliance penalties as well so

588
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,919
this is another screenshot from the

589
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,799
california

590
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,600
attorney general's office you can take a

591
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,640
look at it so they talk a lot about

592
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
the california consumer privacy act how

593
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,120
they how they meet it

594
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
how they collect the information as well

595
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,000
so because of all this data broker

596
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
activities and all these regulations so

597
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,960
in this study we're interested in this

598
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
two things here so we know that there's

599
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
a compliance component here that are

600
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
forcing

601
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
um this data brokers to to actually be

602
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,200
more

603
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
transparent or at least to disclose what

604
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,039
they're doing right

605
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,159
but we want to see that is it the case

606
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
or actually they just try to disclose

607
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,840
everything on the website but we don't

608
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,880
see any

609
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
activities that may lead to more

610
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
transparent behavior

611
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,400
and another thing that we're interested

612
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
in is that

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
now we have the compliance now we have

614
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,640
this

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
all these disclosure requirements of do

616
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
we see fewer breaches or

617
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
do we see fewer incidents that this

618
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
information can be found

619
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
for example on the dark web right these

620
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,039
are the breaches and

621
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
we really care about this kind of things

622
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
so basically

623
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,760
our focus is more like that now we know

624
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
the compliance requirements

625
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
is it effective what kind of things we

626
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,919
have already observed

627
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,400
well based on these requirements after

628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
the the password the effective

629
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
the enact of the the regulations so in

630
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,679
this case we may have some

631
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
policy suggestions or we may be able to

632
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
provide additional observations

633
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
uh when the regulators are focusing on

634
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,840
this

635
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,520
issue so how can we do that

636
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,559
uh obviously we need to find out the

637
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,080
data brokers

638
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
so these are the steps we have been

639
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,120
taking uh

640
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,919
this is actually an ongoing process uh

641
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
i'll explain why it is ongoing

642
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,120
so we have the data brokers from vermont

643
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,159
and california's registration list

644
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
there's a huge overlapping portion of

645
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,720
them it's basically the same as you can

646
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,280
expect that they don't really collect

647
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
the information just from one state it's

648
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
probably everywhere right that's why

649
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,159
there's a huge portion of them are

650
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,919
exactly the same

651
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
then we extract the business

652
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,919
descriptions from these registered data

653
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,039
brokers

654
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,360
so as you can see here on the right hand

655
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
side of the slides

656
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
this is about refinitive right they say

657
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,279
that they serve more than 40 000

658
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,360
institutions across 190 countries

659
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,159
so they provide the information to the

660
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,080
global financial market

661
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
okay so we know that this is a

662
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
description of the company

663
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,960
and we do the same thing for all the

664
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
brokers that we are able to find

665
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
and then the brokers with the

666
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
descriptions that we can find

667
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
then we use this business description to

668
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,159
find a control group

669
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,279
so that means we use the descriptions to

670
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,200
find the companies that are not

671
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
currently registered through vermont or

672
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,159
california state

673
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,120
attorney general's office but they have

674
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
really similar business descriptions

675
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
right so told us that they are probably

676
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,440
doing something similar

677
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
but they probably they are not meeting

678
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
the requirements of these two

679
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,799
regulations

680
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,000
based on this process we have 37

681
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
registered

682
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
data brokers we lose a lot of

683
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
observations because

684
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,080
we want to have their financial

685
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
information and most of them are private

686
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,679
so that's why we only have 37 at this

687
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,559
moment

688
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,320
but we just noticed that there are some

689
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
private company database that we may be

690
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,360
able to

691
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
have access to so in that case we can

692
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
actually expand it a little bit more

693
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,200
then based on this uh description

694
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,960
matching processes

695
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
uh we notice that there are several

696
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,480
companies

697
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,360
from this sase code 7370 7374

698
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,600
of these two industry groups have about

699
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
104 of them

700
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,480
that we can use as the control group

701
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,960
meaning

702
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
they have really similar business

703
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,279
descriptions with the registered data

704
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,039
brokers

705
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,799
so that's step one step two up

706
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,279
not yet step two then then based on the

707
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,960
business descriptions

708
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
uh we are able to put them into

709
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
different groups and you can see the

710
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
biggest group is about background check

711
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
right about the personal about the

712
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,200
business and of course there are a lot

713
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
of different things about marketing

714
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,440
screening

715
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
as a pricing just the the theme of their

716
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
business descriptions

717
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,799
so step two uh based on the business

718
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,840
descriptions

719
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,480
and based on their company's website we

720
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
actually go there and we extract their

721
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,159
privacy policies and

722
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,039
their textual contents um so you may be

723
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,600
able to see a really tiny screenshots we

724
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,640
have here

725
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
so we will be able to find their privacy

726
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,320
statement

727
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,200
um so from here and from the website

728
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
information

729
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
but the key thing we focus on is on that

730
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
what kind of data collection and sharing

731
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
activities these companies have or

732
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
these companies are disclosing to the

733
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
public

734
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,799
right so it can be we are doing this our

735
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,159
algorithm is trying

736
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,039
to do this or for example experian is

737
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,520
collecting this information

738
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
the verb we are looking for can be we're

739
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,120
collecting the information we

740
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,480
sell it or we share it with our partners

741
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
or we store it for example for a 10 10

742
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
year period

743
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,720
these are the things that are looking

744
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,840
for and the object can be a piece of

745
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
information

746
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,840
can be a specific consumer behavior

747
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,799
uh can be type of cookies right so we

748
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
will be able to know that

749
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,159
oh these are the things they are

750
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,400
collecting they are selling so different

751
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
pieces of cost

752
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
what or all kinds of descriptions they

753
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
may have

754
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,600
then based on the information collected

755
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
and from the description we will be able

756
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,320
to do a clustering so we put them into

757
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,679
different

758
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,480
groups and the purpose is that we want

759
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,120
to see

760
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,880
that do they mainly rely on

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,760
the public domain information that means

762
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
if i have the information

763
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,080
everyone has it right everyone has

764
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
access to the similar information

765
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,880
then that's not really a big thing right

766
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320
but if someone has

767
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,279
something that is reading unique they

768
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
will probably need to take another look

769
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,360
or when we try to understand what we're

770
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,399
doing

771
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,039
and interestingly this is how we found

772
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,480
for the registered company a high

773
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,840
proportion

774
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
this is more than 80 percent of them

775
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,399
they have all these publicly

776
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,880
available data that means everyone has

777
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,679
similar

778
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,159
access everyone has access to a similar

779
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,760
set of data

780
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
and a tiny portion of it 18

781
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
roughly or 19 they rely on this kind of

782
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,919
unique data set so this data broker has

783
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,720
something that

784
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,760
people may not have this is for the

785
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
registered part

786
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,640
but here's the surprising part

787
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,120
for the non-registered company that we

788
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,159
found

789
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,520
based on the business description a tiny

790
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,559
portion

791
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,600
30 something almost 40 percent of them

792
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,799
rely on this publicly available data

793
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,200
but they mainly rely on this kind of

794
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
their unique

795
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
data set that is quite different from

796
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,159
everyone else

797
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,720
but this group of people this group of

798
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
business are not

799
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
registered or not under the regulation

800
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,559
or the public's monitoring processes

801
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
okay so that's why we think this is kind

802
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
of interesting

803
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
then based on all this information now

804
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
we have the brokers

805
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,320
or the non-registered brokers we know

806
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,440
their disclosure policies we know what

807
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
kind of data they are relying on for

808
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,799
their

809
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,440
decision making and the last thing will

810
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,620
be

811
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,720
[Music]

812
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,679
are we going to see any consequences any

813
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,720
security breaches

814
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,799
we rely on the the dark web information

815
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,360
my co-authors at rutgers university they

816
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,919
have a

817
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,799
contract with a third-party dark web

818
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,399
monitoring firm

819
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
so that company basically works with the

820
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
law enforcement agencies

821
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
they have a contract with them to

822
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,320
understand more about the dark web

823
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
activities and know different things

824
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,120
here

825
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,559
so we rely on this relationship and see

826
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,360
what kind

827
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,399
how kind of information we can find of

828
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,760
the data brokers

829
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
through the dark web right so if we can

830
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:13,600
see

831
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
several posts for example it's under the

832
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,240
hacker information and if we can see the

833
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
post

834
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,320
then we consider that as a breach

835
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,559
and interestingly we noticed that it's

836
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,559
not just about the broker

837
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,880
itself or just the breached company

838
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,159
itself

839
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,159
sometimes we can see that the

840
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,080
information leakage

841
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,600
is across all the players for example

842
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,399
here's an

843
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,360
um the equifax bridge right that's in

844
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,320
2018

845
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,640
probably they say that there were more

846
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,279
than 575

847
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,000
million settlements and they provide the

848
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,559
free critical monitoring services

849
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,080
and they say that you can learn more

850
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,120
about their actions after the breach

851
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,519
when we search for this breach we notice

852
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,480
that

853
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,799
the information we can find through the

854
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,000
dark web is not just from equifax

855
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,080
we can see the same information from

856
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,679
transunion

857
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,279
and experian so we noticed that hey it's

858
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
not just the bridge from

859
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,360
there may be some collectors or this

860
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
kind of color current

861
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
thing when we try to search for the

862
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,279
hacker information on the dark web

863
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,159
right so that's why we try to define

864
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,559
this

865
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,240
breach not just about the piece of

866
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,080
post by the hackers from the dark web

867
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
but it's also about that

868
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
when there's a breach and it contains

869
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
information from multiple

870
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
sources or we call it the call

871
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,039
occurrence

872
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,880
of the number of posts with multiple

873
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
firms we also count it

874
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,840
right so the equifax liquid database

875
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,080
we can see the credit score and we see

876
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,320
three different sources so in this case

877
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,279
we count it as

878
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,480
one there's a leakage or there's a call

879
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
occurrence here

880
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,760
so here are several results the one

881
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,919
is that we try to understand whether the

882
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,320
registration actually helped

883
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,480
the companies be more transparent do

884
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
they actually talk more about their

885
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,960
collection data collection processes

886
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,320
and this is the findings uh we control

887
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
for the company's revenue

888
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,159
well because when it's bigger sometimes

889
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,559
it may be the target or sometimes you

890
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,000
probably have a better control

891
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,559
mechanism or the environment of the

892
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,519
state

893
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,120
whether it's part of vermont and

894
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
california because of the regulation

895
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
they may be more

896
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,519
careful the funding status whether the

897
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,360
company is going through the ipo

898
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
processes where there is a public traded

899
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,240
company

900
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,440
basically if it's public traded because

901
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
we have all these

902
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,600
uh control mechanisms or governance that

903
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,360
needs to be reviewed so

904
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,760
the behavior may be different right and

905
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,679
whether they're in the register group or

906
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,200
not in the register

907
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
what kind of data collection group they

908
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,480
are in

909
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,840
right okay so the first variable that we

910
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,960
have the interest

911
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,000
is the register or not and we notice

912
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,159
that registered brokers disclose they

913
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,279
are disclosed more

914
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,919
so that's good to us right so the

915
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,679
regulation may actually help them to

916
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,880
actually disclose

917
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,159
more information but uh compared to the

918
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,159
non-registered companies

919
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,640
when they have more unique data they

920
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,799
have fewer disclosures

921
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,039
so you may remember that we try to find

922
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,200
out that whether they have similar data

923
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,120
set compared to their peers

924
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,760
or they have something unique so here we

925
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
found out that if they have something

926
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,840
unique

927
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
they disclosed last year and

928
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,519
how about the information leakage right

929
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:45,919
uh

930
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,399
if they did the non-registered data

931
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,120
brokers

932
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,159
actually have higher information leakage

933
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,799
so the registration hopefully is playing

934
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,000
a role here

935
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,720
right and for the registered brokers

936
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
when the disclosure is high the leakage

937
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,919
is smaller

938
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,640
so this fits into the traditional

939
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
governance literature

940
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
saying that if we have these monetary

941
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,119
functions

942
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
we will be able to push the company to

943
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,719
disclose more

944
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
and because they talk more and because

945
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,320
of this external monitoring

946
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,359
prop monitoring activities

947
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,679
they will be more careful we do have

948
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,879
that right so the leakage is smaller

949
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,399
but uh how about this information

950
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,040
a leakage just the count and the data

951
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,839
uniqueness

952
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,040
right we notice that again if you

953
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,199
haven't registered yet

954
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,879
they will have higher information

955
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,879
leakage so it's the same thing

956
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,839
but how about the data uniqueness we

957
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,399
notice that the register the data broker

958
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,520
may show

959
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,560
higher information leakage on the unique

960
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,679
data set right that's because it's the

961
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,960
same argument

962
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
when they have the unique data set they

963
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
talk less to the public

964
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,040
this part is more like still the black

965
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,160
box thing

966
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,320
and this portion is actually that may

967
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
lead to the leakage

968
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,280
in the future and the last part will be

969
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,359
uh the information leakage about the

970
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
core occurrence right do we actually

971
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:13,920
create

972
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,440
this more like a systemic bridge across

973
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,920
all the competitors or all the related

974
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
parties

975
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,000
and we show that the registered data

976
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,920
broker actually have a higher

977
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,720
information call leakage right and then

978
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
if it's not registered

979
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
they have a higher colleague just on the

980
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,520
unique data set

981
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,599
so these are the things we have been

982
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,040
working on so

983
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,800
overall we showed that this kind of

984
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,000
registration effect still debatable but

985
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,119
we like that

986
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,440
when the registration can actually push

987
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,640
them to disclose

988
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,440
more and the registration can actually

989
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
push them to actually to have fewer

990
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
information leakage but it's not really

991
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,079
the case right

992
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,079
if you have this unique data you may

993
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,000
have all these leakages

994
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,839
and then you may actually have a lot of

995
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,440
different things that may be

996
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,320
effect across the board and then just

997
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
everyone got hit

998
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
automatically so that's the the

999
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,400
inpatient still not clear here but

1000
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
here are some additional things that we

1001
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,560
we can summarize here

1002
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
we notice that for the non-registered

1003
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,400
data brokers

1004
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,520
we do see more breaches for them through

1005
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,359
the dark web

1006
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,440
and then they actually since they are

1007
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,359
not regulated or they are not really

1008
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,320
monitored

1009
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,280
from the public's perspective of their

1010
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,320
called data collection activities uh

1011
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,359
it's more like blurry or really vague

1012
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,440
they do not really try to explain how

1013
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
they're trying to collect the

1014
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
information how they sell it or how they

1015
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,079
share it

1016
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
right for the registered data broker

1017
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,760
it's good because we don't really find

1018
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,960
um

1019
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
that's huge amount of breaches through

1020
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,880
the dark web

1021
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
but if they have some unique data sets

1022
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,920
they're

1023
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,400
having that's the portion that can be

1024
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,760
leaked out but that's actually

1025
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,119
concerning because

1026
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,440
if everyone has it then that's probably

1027
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,240
not a

1028
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,400
big issue but if you are leaking all

1029
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
this unique information then that can

1030
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
cause a bigger problem here

1031
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,520
the last thing is that we noticed that

1032
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,280
the registered data broker are more

1033
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,920
prone to this kind of co-leakage

1034
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,320
because of these sharing activities

1035
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,280
right so they share

1036
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
across the board with their other data

1037
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
brokers

1038
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
and this kind of sharing activities can

1039
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
cause a bigger problem when

1040
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,760
there's a breach and then we can

1041
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
actually find those pieces of

1042
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,839
information through the dark web

1043
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,040
and then we also observe that

1044
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,359
because this kind of non-registered data

1045
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,040
broker they actually

1046
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,160
have a huge relatively bigger weight of

1047
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,640
this

1048
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,440
unique data set and then when they have

1049
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,000
a breach

1050
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
we actually see a significantly higher

1051
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,560
amount of this call leakage

1052
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,599
through the dark web so overall you can

1053
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,000
see

1054
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,480
that uh this kind of data broker

1055
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
registration is kind of interesting

1056
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
and how you may affect the actual

1057
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
activities

1058
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
uh or the disclosure activities and the

1059
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
consequences

1060
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,160
so in our next step will be now we know

1061
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,800
that

1062
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,280
the disclosing activities now we know

1063
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,000
that

1064
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,640
the actual breaches are we able to

1065
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
capture their actual data sharing

1066
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,680
or data collecting activities through

1067
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
cookies with other companies

1068
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,040
so that would be our next step and

1069
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,079
i'm really good i use 40 minutes and as

1070
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,119
planned

1071
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,119
we have about 10 minutes for questions

1072
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,560
and answers

1073
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,440
so if you have anything just let us know

1074
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,480
yeah thank you so much

1075
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,280
thank you david it was an uh super

1076
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,720
interesting

1077
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,320
talk it feels like uh

1078
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,839
i mean this work can be submitted to any

1079
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,000
security or privacy conference oh yes

1080
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,280
seriously so i was taking all the time

1081
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
notes

1082
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,440
um i think data brokers needs

1083
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,800
further investigation i'm pretty sure

1084
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
there are lots of interesting things

1085
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,240
that we can find yes but

1086
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,520
i um i think the most important thing is

1087
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
accessing the data or confirming that

1088
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,160
they are really collecting these data

1089
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,119
somehow

1090
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
right right so i guess currently you are

1091
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,200
just dependent

1092
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,320
on their publicly available business

1093
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,119
plans

1094
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,400
yes correct okay for the

1095
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,680
for the cookies uh

1096
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,599
that's our plan to to actually collect

1097
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,920
the cookies through different websites

1098
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,160
and see who is actually behind all these

1099
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
third-party cookies

1100
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,680
so that will be the actual data

1101
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,480
collecting behavior right

1102
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
okay so one quick question that i would

1103
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
like to

1104
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,400
ask is if you like look at

1105
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,720
in detail the regulations or laws

1106
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,839
um or to see whether they kind of

1107
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,839
violate these regulations

1108
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,880
somehow for their benefits yes

1109
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,160
yep that's a really good question so uh

1110
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
we were talking about this because when

1111
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
we see that how come that

1112
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
uh many companies that have similar

1113
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
business descriptions but they are not

1114
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
really part of the

1115
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,040
the scope of the regulation right so

1116
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
you'll be interesting to see

1117
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,800
that what kind of actions they are

1118
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
taking or what kind of activities they

1119
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,440
have

1120
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,319
and how come that they don't need to be

1121
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,000
registered through the attorney

1122
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,560
general's office then that will be

1123
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,359
itself is

1124
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,560
already an interesting comparison

1125
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,440
yes all right thank you yeah thank you i

1126
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
think we have one question

1127
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,000
in q a

1128
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,480
so the but the question is do you know

1129
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
to what extent

1130
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,280
ld is using some of those data brokers

1131
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,839
also have you looked at what the

1132
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,440
exposure to international state actor is

1133
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,680
well that's a good question um no not

1134
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,000
yet

1135
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,800
there are some challenges about

1136
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,560
identifying the players within this

1137
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,720
whole market

1138
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,760
currently we do this manually because we

1139
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,240
don't

1140
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,000
we don't really know what's the

1141
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
population or

1142
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,160
actually the players in the market yet

1143
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,079
right so if we're able to actually have

1144
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,880
a

1145
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
network of all the data brokers how they

1146
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,960
share with each other no matter it's

1147
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,319
domestically

1148
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,400
or internationally they'll be excellent

1149
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,280
well thank you and actually uh i do have

1150
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,400
a follow-up comment

1151
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,119
um part of the research uh i'm doing

1152
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,680
here is

1153
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,960
uh around trying to measure or figure

1154
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,880
out how to quantify the

1155
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
levels at which uh bad guys are looking

1156
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,400
at security researchers

1157
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
um which involves a lot of

1158
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
techniques around managing the data

1159
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,560
exhaust the data exhaust of a user

1160
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
and also creating some traps where i can

1161
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,480
basically measure

1162
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,520
uh people accessing those so there may

1163
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,079
be some

1164
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,599
future work which in maybe we can

1165
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
collaborate i was also curious do you

1166
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,880
work with john kristof by chance uh no

1167
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,440
no okay because he's at the po right now

1168
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
uh and he's finishing his

1169
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
cdm yes yeah he's in computer science

1170
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,079
yes correct

1171
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,920
yeah we can please send me an email we

1172
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,440
can have another meeting after

1173
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,240
after the talk doing definitely yeah

1174
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,119
thank you so much

1175
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,800
thank you um yeah so

1176
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,839
this is really cool uh and i'm not aware

1177
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,160
of

1178
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,240
any research work in

1179
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
security conferences about this probably

1180
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,960
one reason is accessing the data

1181
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,040
or proving that your findings are

1182
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,000
correct

1183
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,599
might be difficult yes that's correct

1184
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,319
yeah otherwise there's a there uh

1185
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,720
there's a ieee security and privacy one

1186
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,359
right

1187
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,000
yes yeah that would be a really good

1188
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,359
gallery

1189
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,960
yes so i have one phd student

1190
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,599
right now looking at some social aspects

1191
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,359
of technology

1192
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,480
or privacy concerns so maybe i can also

1193
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,440
