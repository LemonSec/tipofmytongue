1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
we have done collaborative research with

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
sandia for a number of years we've had

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
to do the research here we've bumped it

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
up we've sent it to albuquerque and then

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
they run the emulations of our research

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
on their laboratory

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
well they've now placed a clone of that

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
laboratory here so that enables us to be

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
able to

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,359
instead of packaging and sending it

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
across country we're able to do the

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
research here and then run the

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
experimentation the emulations of the

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,360
research here it enables uh it enables

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,399
us to speed up our delivery of top

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,840
quality research to the department of

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
energy more so for last two to three

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
years i have been trying to explore the

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,840
applications

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
of applied cryptography and distributed

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,879
systems protocols consensus protocol

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,360
towards building solution that can work

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
on cyber physical environment and iot

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,199
environment

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,160
these tasks come with cost associated

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,400
with building such solutions on embedded

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
devices what solas offers us is an easy

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
opportunity to decide the configuration

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
that we have to deal with and use and

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
build our solution on top of them and

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
then check through experiments how good

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,680
or bad our algorithm do in such

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,439
environment so it's so less indeed

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
offers us extreme

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,040
efficacy and if

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
efficiency in terms of building our

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
experiments

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
the so the research that we are

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
performing solar has been helpful to us

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
towards our

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
different projects associated with

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
embedded environment that includes my

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,600
project with army research lab as well

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
as my project related to and associated

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,799
with the uh

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,119
usda that is united states department of

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,759
agriculture so as a simulator that

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
allowed us to

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,439
study how network affects computer

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,719
region

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
we study when the different scenarios

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
when many strings of video are

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,560
transmitting the network and we want to

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
change the network configuration

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
and study how computer vision responds

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
to the network conditions

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
how the video qualities change and

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
affect the result of a video network

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
solas has given us insight about how to

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,120
analyze video more efficiently

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
this summer i received three research

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
grants with a total amount of

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
2.8 million dollars

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,160
because of the understanding of computer

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,879
region using solas

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
but at the end we do need to deliver our

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
research artifacts to our sponsor so

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
having a local testbed that is identical

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
or almost identical to the ones running

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
at the sponsor side will actually help

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
you know maintain the quality of the

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
results and also minimize the effort of

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,720
reproducing the results you know once

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
the results or the artifacts are

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
delivered back to the sponsor because we

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
have the same platform we have the same

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
setup and we can even involve

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
researchers from the national lab while

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,239
we are still doing the development so

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
that you know we make sure that the

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,159
results that we generate are the ones

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,800
that will readily run on their sites

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
solace is a

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
extendable and scalable platform

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
because of its hybrid nature basically

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,680
it brings in

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
the real aspect of a system and also

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,959
some other aspects will be emulated in a

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,920
scalable fashion and by doing that we

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,599
are able to scale

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
the size of our experiment up to a

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
million endpoints so that even with one

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
million endpoints we are the testbed

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,040
will be able to deliver results uh that

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
are you know that can be validated and

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
uh scale so the partnership that sandia

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
and steers has had has been phenomenal

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,959
and it's been uh

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
very productive

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,519
and it's

101
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
it's just a model that could be expanded

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
to

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
companies and government partners to to

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
think about their approaches and their

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,360
problem spaces to come and continue to

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,799
work with citrus and the the

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
collaborative nature that they have here

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,040
to to to think about how these tools can

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,840
be

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
further developed and further

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
implemented yeah we're hoping that solas

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,199
really sets up the framework for other

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,000
companies and partners to come and work

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
with purdue and take advantage of the

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
platform and its strengths and continue

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
to grow the activities beyond what it is

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
today

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,220
[Music]

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
you
