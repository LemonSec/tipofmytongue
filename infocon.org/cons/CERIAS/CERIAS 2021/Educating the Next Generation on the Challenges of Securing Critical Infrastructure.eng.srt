1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
uh good afternoon and welcome to the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,000
this week's episode of the serious

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,759
security seminar

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,559
so bear with me for a second in 1992

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,599
purdue's coast

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
laboratory was established in the

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,280
computer science department here

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,120
which was one of the very first computer

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,640
security labs that was established in

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,520
the world

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
in 1998 coast transitioned into sirius

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
with a grant from the lilly family of

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,599
the lilly foundation

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,039
and with the primary difference between

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
coast and sirius was the opportunity to

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
be able to take a look at cyber and

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,680
cyber physical security from an

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,960
interdisciplinary perspective

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,040
we've grown over the last 22 years now

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,000
including more than 135 faculty

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
from 18 different academic departments

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,280
across

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,000
eight different colleges so i think we

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,320
are

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,039
absolutely truly living that

26
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,920
interdisciplinary mission

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,640
very well but if you take a look at our

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,440
our speakers

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,440
over the last 20 plus years no surprise

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
many of them come from computer science

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
departments or electrical engineering

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
departments or applied computing

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,840
departments

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
when they come from academia or they

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
work it within typical i.t organizations

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
or within cyber security

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
organizations within corporations so

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
it's always rewarding for us to be able

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
to invite a speaker who comes with a

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
unique perspective to that and that is

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,600
certainly the case today

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
so it's my great pleasure today to

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
introduce a professor david

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
henthorne david is from rose holmen's

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
chemical engineering department

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,240
dr henthorne is an expert in bio

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
biomaterials

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
biosensors and polymers in medical

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
application but his research includes

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
the modernization of industrial control

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,400
systems

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
including the major push to enhance the

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
cyber security

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,759
of crawl of all critical infrastructure

55
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,000
david welcome to purdue

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
thanks thanks yeah i wanted to talk

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,360
today about educating the next

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
generation on the challenges of securing

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
critical infrastructure

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,799
um like the introduction said i'm a

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,159
chemical engineering professor at rose

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
holmen institute of technology which is

63
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
in terre haute indiana

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
which is actually just down river from

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
purdue on the wabash river so you can

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
throw something in the river and

67
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
eventually i'll i'll get it down to here

68
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
um

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
so real quick about me my chemical

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,280
engineering degrees are actually from

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,879
purdue my bachelor's and ph.d

72
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
degrees are from purdue university and

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
i've been teaching chemical engineering

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,640
at rose holmen since around 2012.

75
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
my main areas are that we teach and do

76
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
research in or industrial control

77
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,599
systems

78
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,160
uh chemical plant design and

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
applications of data science then

80
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,879
especially in product

81
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
process technology and process

82
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
automation but my interest was always in

83
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,720
combining computers and uh chemical

84
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
engineering or chemistry

85
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
and so i'll give you a picture of a

86
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
place kind of like my first job my first

87
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
internship as i was a chemical

88
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,879
engineering student

89
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,519
at purdue my chemical plant didn't look

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,239
this nice

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,120
i kind of fancifully wish i had been in

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
something this that's nice looking

93
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
but it was a combined chemical and

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
pharmaceutical

95
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
facility with adjacent research

96
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,680
facilities

97
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,200
and i was hired there even though i was

98
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
a chemical engineering student i wasn't

99
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,239
actually hired as a chemical engineer i

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:04,959
was hired

101
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,239
in the it department uh this is in the

102
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,040
in the

103
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,239
mid 19 mid to late 1990s and

104
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
they're starting to see this big

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
expansion of all these devices that are

106
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,760
getting hooked onto the network

107
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
and so they're hoping that at a chemical

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
plant maybe they could have a chemical

109
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,519
engineer

110
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,120
being able to run it back and forth

111
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
between the it department

112
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
and oftentimes what we call the ot the

113
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
operations technology department

114
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
and we'd be able to run back and forth

115
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
and so in addition to the sort of normal

116
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,799
uh network admin

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
sort of duties that i was doing there

118
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
um also just digging around everywhere

119
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,080
trying to figure out all the different

120
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
assets that were being plugged into the

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
network whether they were

122
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
expected to be there or not so i spent

123
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
most of the summer running around just

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
tracing cables trying to figure out who

125
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,599
owned what

126
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,400
and what potential threats these devices

127
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,120
could have

128
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
and all these different things and so

129
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
that was a really cool experience as a

130
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
chemical engineering student is to go in

131
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
and work actually on the i.t side and so

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,519
i come back to purdue

133
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
fresh off this internship and i got very

134
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
involved in high performance computing

135
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
for molecular simulations so big

136
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
molecules on supercomputers

137
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
purdue had a great uh supercomputer in

138
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
the late 1990s

139
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
something like 70th or something like

140
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
that on the top 500 list

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
uh research-wise it was going great but

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,918
we wanted more and so we ended up

143
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
uh petitioning and finding some money

144
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,280
and then eventually my laboratory that i

145
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
was doing my phd in

146
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
we built our own linux cluster but while

147
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
i was there there were these serious

148
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,960
lectures

149
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
and even though i might have had a

150
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
little bit of imposter syndrome going

151
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,919
over to them

152
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
i went to them and so i actually found

153
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,199
because all these

154
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
lectures are are listed online still i

155
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
found the first uh serious lecture that

156
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
i ever attended so february 20th

157
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
1998 uh lecture by professor stafford

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
himself

159
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
because i wanted to hear about well all

160
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
these things are getting networked

161
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
um and what's what

162
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
what is this expert thinking about all

163
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,360
the different privacy concerns

164
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
and i was pretty scared by the last line

165
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
there it says attendees are expected to

166
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,120
provide

167
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
comments and questions and so the the

168
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
imposter syndrome was pretty real

169
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
when i saw that line but it was a great

170
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,680
experience

171
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
but looking back through that list of

172
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,800
serious

173
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,639
lectures i actually stumbled upon one i

174
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,639
didn't go to but i really wish i had

175
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
so back in september of that year or

176
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,199
sorry in september of that year

177
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
we had william harris from the newly

178
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
formed critical infrastructure assurance

179
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,240
office

180
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
it's a little history about that is that

181
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
in 1996 there was an executive order

182
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
issued by president clinton that said

183
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,479
hey

184
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,960
all of our critical infrastructure is

185
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
getting networked it's getting

186
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
uh we're having communications either

187
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
internally or at least possibly

188
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
to the external world as well and so

189
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
this has uh dramatic concerns

190
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
uh from the national security point of

191
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
view and so in 1996 this executive order

192
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
was was issued and i want to call

193
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
attention to it that

194
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
it's 25 years ago as of tomorrow so july

195
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,280
15

196
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
1996 this executive order created the

197
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,479
president's commission on critical

198
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,280
infrastructure

199
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
protection and this led to various uh

200
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,680
congressional hearings on critical

201
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
infrastructure and how we should secure

202
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
it

203
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
um and importantly it led to the this uh

204
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
commission's report critical foundations

205
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
protecting america's infrastructures

206
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,960
published october of 1997 or around

207
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
there

208
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
eventually that report was put into

209
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
directives

210
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
so directive 63 policy on critical

211
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,639
infrastructure

212
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,440
protection came out in 1998 leading to

213
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,319
things like

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,600
well the creation of that critical

215
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
infrastructure assurance office amongst

216
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
other things so back 25 years ago

217
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
people are starting to say uh we need to

218
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
really be thinking about how we can

219
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
secure critical infrastructure

220
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,759
especially as more and more of it gets

221
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
connected in fact

222
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
you remind me flipping back a screen

223
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,080
here the the title of dr harris's talk

224
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,360
was infrastructure

225
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
assurance the challenge of the next

226
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,400
millennium and it couldn't have been

227
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
more correct about that we are here in

228
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,199
the next millennium and

229
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,840
every day we're reading about more and

230
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
more uh critical infrastructure being

231
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
attacked ransomware and these different

232
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,599
things especially in the last few months

233
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
so this conditions report lays out this

234
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
eight part strategy for

235
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
uh for securing our critical

236
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
infrastructure and

237
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
central theme there uh we really need to

238
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
build partnerships between

239
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,919
owner operators so private entities and

240
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
governmental agencies and

241
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,199
this is actually mirrored very much in

242
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
the most recent

243
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,599
executive order that the biden

244
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
administration just put out saying

245
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
we should push our governmental agencies

246
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,039
to really

247
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
set the bar to improve and buoy the

248
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,599
private sector up to a higher level that

249
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
whole thing about a rising tide lifts

250
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,000
all boats

251
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
and so if we set our expectations high

252
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
that'll force vendors to meet them

253
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
and along the way they're going to then

254
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
be able to provide the

255
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,080
private sector with uh much more secure

256
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
products

257
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
um i'm an educator though and so if you

258
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,319
don't mind i'm going to jump into

259
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
chapter 8 and focus on that one

260
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
uh the report on awareness and education

261
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
so in that report chapter eight about

262
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,840
awareness and

263
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,199
education first of all it starts off

264
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,960
like saying uh

265
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,879
smokey the bear is this famous awareness

266
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,160
campaign maybe we should have something

267
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
like smokey the bear for

268
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,120
securing critical infrastructure and

269
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
i've had lots lots of dreams of what

270
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
that would look like

271
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,479
uh but on the education

272
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,680
side it all boils down to we must as we

273
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
as we plug more stuff in as more and

274
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
more stuff gets connected

275
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
we have to improve the general knowledge

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
base

277
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,039
throughout the entire nation on cyber

278
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
security skills basically

279
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
and so they split that into two separate

280
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
things professional

281
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,080
and and general education

282
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
recommendations

283
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
so on the professional side we wanted to

284
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
recommended to expand capabilities of

285
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,519
higher educational

286
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,839
institutions to teach information

287
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
security

288
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,760
and at the time after some congressional

289
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
hearings in which case actually

290
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
professor stafford was was mentioned and

291
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
then cited in this report

292
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
uh his fact comes out that only four

293
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
institutions at that time were teaching

294
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
information security at the phd level

295
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
and so that dramatically needed to

296
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,920
improve if we want to

297
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
improve and secure our critical

298
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
infrastructure

299
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
so their recommendations on that front

300
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
support professional conferences

301
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,040
additional research grants and these

302
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
different things in this area to build

303
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
up

304
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
professional capabilities on in

305
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
information security with the idea that

306
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,120
at the phd level

307
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
those people will turn into the next

308
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
educators at the college level

309
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
who will then turn into uh training the

310
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
next people that are training

311
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
at vocational schools or high schools or

312
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
whatever and then trickle it

313
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
down that way but build at the at the

314
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
high level the phd level

315
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
from information security on the general

316
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,839
education

317
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
side um they came through and said well

318
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
it's deficiencies in the training of

319
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,760
technicians and so as a person that

320
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
works with critical infrastructure

321
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
i'm a control systems person when i hear

322
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
technicians it's the people that are

323
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
there running the chemical plant day in

324
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
and day out so that's what it means

325
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
to me is saying the deficiencies and the

326
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,519
training technicians

327
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
are reflected in the day-to-day

328
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
operations and so we need to improve

329
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,399
that and i

330
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
think there's we could have gone more in

331
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
that area so

332
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
looking back now 25 years i think we

333
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
could have done a little bit more

334
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
so how did we do 25 years later

335
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,440
well in terms of information security uh

336
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
huge growth absolutely massive growth

337
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
and i think the number of people on the

338
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,279
call would be better suited to to

339
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
to kind of look back and say yeah this

340
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
is how we did and everything like that

341
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
but from somebody

342
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
uh outside looking at that saying uh

343
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
massive growth in terms of information

344
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
security how it's taught

345
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
at various levels um it hasn't

346
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
translated 100

347
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,920
though into uh benefits for critical

348
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
infrastructure we're seeing obviously

349
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
still problems with securing critical

350
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
infrastructure

351
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,320
and so i think it boils down to these

352
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,920
are extremely valuable

353
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
skills that these people have if you're

354
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,000
if you have a high level degree or if

355
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
you have

356
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
great training in information security

357
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
and so market forces have split them out

358
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,440
into

359
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
various different um various different

360
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
corporations entities and these sorts of

361
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
things and so securing

362
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
critical infrastructure uh competes and

363
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,399
i'm gonna say it competes against

364
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,880
top-tier destinations um you know

365
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
talking to computer science or software

366
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,680
engineering students then they would

367
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
love to go to

368
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,600
certain companies um and less so that

369
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
they want to go sure make sure that the

370
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
nuclear reactor doesn't blow up or

371
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
something like that

372
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
on the general education side i feel a

373
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
little bit more comfortable talking

374
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,399
about that

375
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
um i'm thinking that the real world

376
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
proof here kind of shows that we didn't

377
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
quite hit the mark of

378
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,279
spreading out this day-to-day operations

379
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,480
and day-to-day

380
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
training in in cyber security to get

381
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
more of the general population

382
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
comfortable with cyber security of

383
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
critical infrastructure

384
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,399
and so i kind of say should this have

385
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,399
been limited to what we call technicians

386
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
i think it could have been more of the

387
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,399
general population

388
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,680
and especially people that me that

389
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
design critical infrastructure we we

390
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,399
missed the bow

391
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
clearly so what else happened in 25

392
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,320
years well

393
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
i mean the big caveat here is september

394
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
11 2001 happens

395
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
uh new executive orders come out from

396
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,040
the from the bush administration

397
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
um and that led to a large

398
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,399
reorganization of

399
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,200
how we at the governmental level how we

400
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
handle critical infrastructure and who

401
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
who guides people in those regards and

402
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,680
so forth

403
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
department department of homeland

404
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,240
security for example was formed

405
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,800
2002. ciao

406
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
which was formed on the department of

407
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
com commerce then gets folded into

408
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
homeland security

409
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
homeland security also folds in some

410
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
other critical infrastructure um

411
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
components from the fbi and other

412
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,839
agencies uh but the big one would be in

413
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,760
2018 we get cisa the cyber security

414
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
infrastructure security administration

415
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
and that's kind of our modern go-to

416
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
administration

417
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
for critical infrastructure and so we

418
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
might as well talk about what actually

419
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
is critical infrastructure so i'll use

420
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
the modern definition that sisa has

421
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
cisa identifies 16 sectors

422
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,560
and those are sectors where their assets

423
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
are so

424
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
valuable or vital to the national

425
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
security or the economic security of the

426
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,959
united states

427
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
that if something were to happen to them

428
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
we would have debilitating effects to

429
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,160
our economy or national

430
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
security or something like that so 16

431
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
sectors

432
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
um so in the last in the last couple

433
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,040
months

434
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,959
we've had a number of incidents but two

435
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
of the more major

436
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
ones and two of the more high profile

437
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
ones we had the colonial pipeline in may

438
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
which supplied about half the fuel to

439
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
the eastern side of the united states

440
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
that was shut down with ransomware and

441
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
then a similar ransomware attack

442
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,040
a few weeks later shutdown and meat

443
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,320
processing plants uh

444
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
us australia canada it's actually a

445
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,440
brazilian

446
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,079
company and so the former director the

447
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,320
first director i should say of um

448
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
cisa chris krebs was on the today show

449
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
not too long ago and he had this great

450
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
quote that i liked they went after our

451
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,079
gas and they went after our hot dogs

452
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
no one is out of bounds here about

453
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
critical infrastructure

454
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
and so we've now established that

455
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,760
critical infrastructure involves

456
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
gasoline and hot dogs but what else does

457
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
it potentially

458
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
involve well things like dams power

459
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
plants electrical grid

460
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
uh manufacturing transportation water

461
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,079
facilities

462
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
food and ag chemical plants nuclear

463
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,199
facilities these kinds of things and

464
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,079
just remember

465
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,160
my biases i'm a chemical engineer and so

466
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
if i keep running back home to control

467
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
systems and chemical plants or

468
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,959
pharmaceutical plants

469
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
um sorry those are my biases and so

470
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,399
you're welcome to ask

471
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,680
ask questions along the way and

472
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
everything like that but if i keep

473
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,720
running back to examples being in like

474
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,000
the chemical field or something like

475
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,560
that that's

476
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,839
just kind of who i am so

477
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
so this past year i set out to learn

478
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,079
more about educating students

479
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,519
in critical infrastructure cyber

480
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,199
security and i i

481
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,160
tacked that two-fold um i started

482
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,839
contacting computer science or software

483
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,360
engineering department saying hey

484
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
would you mind if i came in and like

485
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
guest lectured

486
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,320
or gave a seminar or something like that

487
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
and so i've been talking on the cs and

488
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,760
se side at the

489
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
undergrad and grad level what's unique

490
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,639
about critical infrastructure why are we

491
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
having such a hard time

492
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,600
getting it secured and then we typically

493
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,760
walk through some incident reports some

494
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
famous incidents and stuff like that

495
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
that's been really fun

496
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
i've also been working with engineering

497
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,440
students and trying to get them

498
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
to have a better base knowledge of some

499
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
basic cyber security skills

500
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,880
and then how and thinking about how we

501
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
perhaps through our critical

502
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,079
infrastructure design process we

503
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
actually lead to some of these

504
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
deficiencies in cyber security

505
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
so what's worked so far well just

506
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
discussion questions have been pretty

507
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,800
good for example here's one that that

508
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
popped up in

509
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
in may that i was asking my students uh

510
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
so we're talking about the colonial

511
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,480
pipeline

512
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
ransomware incident and

513
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,440
it becomes clear after a few days that

514
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
their i.t networks are the ones that are

515
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,959
affected by ransomware but the ot

516
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,320
networks the operations technology

517
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
basically the control systems and

518
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
associated devices there

519
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,440
they're not affected and so they shut

520
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
the pipeline down so they shut down all

521
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
the ot networks the control systems

522
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,519
those

523
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,720
everything like that they shut those

524
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
things down but they weren't actually

525
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
being affected at the time

526
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
by ransomware and so it's a great

527
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
discussion question for the class and if

528
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
anybody

529
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
you know has a chance to do this then

530
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
ask your students if you would have been

531
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
in that situation would you have shut

532
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,680
down a pipeline

533
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
um obviously it led to massive

534
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
disruptions in the fuel

535
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
supply to the eastern side of the united

536
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,440
states and

537
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
it was significant financial loss for

538
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,639
that company and

539
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
financial uh disruption for the country

540
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
as a result of that

541
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
so would you have done it knowing what

542
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
you did so

543
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,199
it's a great discussion question and i

544
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,800
got great um

545
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
questions about that so what else worked

546
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,920
um

547
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,880
we hosted current events thing uh so

548
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
during the colonial pipeline ransomware

549
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,440
attack again

550
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
we did a panel discussion this is at

551
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,039
night it's virtual everybody's virtual

552
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
these days it's nice and easy

553
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
we invited people from computer science

554
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
software engineering we invited uh

555
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
an individual from our it department at

556
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
rose holmen

557
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
and then we had an individual greg

558
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,199
newman who is more on the

559
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,599
uh petrochemical so fuels and technology

560
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,720
that kind of stuff side

561
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
as well as having a computer uh control

562
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,079
system person myself

563
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
there and we did a panel and it was

564
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
attended not just by students but also

565
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
by faculty members and somehow it was

566
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
also attended like if

567
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
people in the community found out and

568
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
the cool thing from an energy from a

569
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
from an educational institution point of

570
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
view uh even prospective students logged

571
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
on it was really neat is cool experience

572
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,799
but by far one of my favorite parts has

573
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
been working through case studies with

574
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
students and i've actually found a few

575
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
case studies that work really really

576
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,320
well

577
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
both when i'm talking to people more

578
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,320
versed in cyber security

579
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,919
and people that are more versed on the

580
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,120
engineering side or the critical

581
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,559
infrastructure side

582
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,799
and so you know this parallels a lot of

583
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,600
fields that use

584
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,559
incident reports um as case studies to

585
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
teach things and so on my side

586
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
we frequently go back to the chemical

587
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,559
safety board videos csb

588
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
if you've not watched on youtube

589
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
chemical safety board videos

590
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
i recommend you take a chance to do that

591
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
they are so informative and they're so

592
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,799
well done

593
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,880
uh they're targeted to the general

594
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
population and

595
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
they're just absolutely wonderful and

596
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
it's just over and over this series of

597
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
events that didn't seem probable

598
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
but yet happened leading to this

599
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,440
incident or that incident and it's

600
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
really really informative and of course

601
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
if you're doing airline stuff

602
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
ntsb and these different things like

603
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
that so

604
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
walking students through here has been

605
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
really great experience

606
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
and so i guess if you don't mind let's

607
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
let's walk through

608
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
um potentially one here so first for the

609
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
computer science software engineering

610
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,160
students

611
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,919
i usually focus on what goes into

612
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,520
designing critical infrastructure why do

613
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,559
engineers

614
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,120
traditional engineers those kinds of

615
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,919
things why did

616
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
those engineers do or why did they make

617
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
the decisions that they made that led to

618
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,400
this

619
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,679
what makes critical infrastructure

620
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
different than the technology and the

621
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,160
tech that you're

622
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
you're used to working with every day

623
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
and why is it just so hard to secure

624
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
on my engineering side uh on my

625
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,799
engineering student side

626
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
um i i've been telling them you know

627
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
these are

628
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
increasing in frequency and so how do

629
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,840
you pers

630
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
protect your site how do you protect

631
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
yourself from these things

632
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
and then if that's not motivation enough

633
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,559
i basically say you know here's an

634
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,760
incident report and here's where the

635
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
engineer failed to do what they needed

636
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
to do and blah blah blah

637
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,679
how do you keep yourself out of the

638
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
after incident reports how do you keep

639
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
yourself out of news

640
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,760
out of the news um back in february

641
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,679
where you see the solarwinds ceo blaming

642
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,000
an

643
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
intern for a solarwinds 123 password i

644
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,360
think there's a lot

645
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,919
more to that story than that but it was

646
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,600
that person was a convenient scapegoat

647
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,160
so

648
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,919
how do you keep yourself on those after

649
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,640
incident in reports or out of the news

650
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
so one of my favorite ones to work with

651
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,679
uh

652
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
when i'm teaching these courses um is

653
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
this 2017 attack on the petrochemical

654
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
refinery in saudi arabia

655
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,200
the information securities infosec

656
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
community frequently refers to it as

657
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,799
trisys or triton but it is it is an

658
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,919
attack on a

659
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
petroleum refinery over in saudi arabia

660
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,000
so when i teach this i usually provide

661
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
these white papers for anyone that's

662
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
interested

663
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,559
and here's three really good ones so we

664
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
have the first one from fireeye mandiant

665
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
second one from dragos and then a third

666
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
one is a black hat usa conference paper

667
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,520
that was published

668
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,480
um from authors uh from bizomi networks

669
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
so you get these headlines triton is the

670
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,080
world's most

671
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
murderous malware and it's spreading

672
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
which sounds

673
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,679
incredible right we walk through we find

674
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,120
that it's a little bit more

675
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
nuanced well it's a lot more nuanced

676
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
than that and

677
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
it's it's interesting but one of the key

678
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,679
takeaways behind

679
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
this attack uh it seems that the

680
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,039
attackers were

681
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
very much interested in causing some

682
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
sort of catastrophic event

683
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,960
with the chemical plant explosion or

684
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
something like that some major

685
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
safety incident that they're interested

686
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
in

687
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,159
causing so that seemed to be the end

688
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,520
goal

689
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,559
and so i usually kick off with

690
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,880
these things that have massive scales in

691
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
terms of size

692
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
um 1 000 to 8 000 acres are very typical

693
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
sizes for chemical nuclear power plants

694
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,520
mega manufacturing that kind of thing

695
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,280
and so um what we frequently talk about

696
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,600
is

697
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
with students like what's the size of

698
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
your campus like just to get them a

699
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,240
ballpark view

700
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
so this uh this cyber attack this uh

701
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
petr

702
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,919
petrochemical refinery attack occurred

703
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,600
in a place that was four thousand acres

704
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,480
in size

705
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
and so i looked it up purdue university

706
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,919
is about 2 500 acres

707
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
in size so the this chemical plant was

708
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,120
nearly twice as large as purdue's campus

709
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
and as a former purdue student

710
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
purdue's campus felt enormous especially

711
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,320
when you looked at that and said

712
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,159
i have to walk where at 7 30 in the

713
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,520
morning because it seems like all my

714
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
classes were at 7 30 in the morning as

715
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
an engineering student

716
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,559
the colonial pipeline itself is 5 000

717
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
plus miles long

718
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
of semiconductor fabs we have

719
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,919
semiconductor shortage right now and so

720
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,640
there's this

721
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
burst of activity well it's been planned

722
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
for years but the focus is very much on

723
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
getting it out as soon as possible

724
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
there's this big burst of activity in

725
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
semiconductor fabs

726
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
and these are 5 million to 10 million

727
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,360
square foot buildings

728
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
um and then similar with like tesla

729
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
gigafactories and these sorts of things

730
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
two thousand three thousand acres are

731
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,840
typically what tesla looks for

732
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,199
as a new site

733
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
and these massive systems end up costing

734
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
massive amounts of money so millions

735
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
hundreds of millions to billions of

736
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
dollars total

737
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
and we need very specialized systems and

738
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,799
to run these things but because they're

739
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,559
so big and because they cost so much

740
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,200
money

741
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
we typically design these things to have

742
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
a very long life

743
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
lifetime 25 plus years is easy and so

744
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
we expect these things to operate

745
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
continuously and then last for

746
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
decades and decades and decades and so

747
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
we haven't been budgeting enough

748
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,039
for upgrades we haven't been budging

749
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
enough time

750
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
downtime to fix things and make sure

751
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,760
things are modernized and all these

752
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
different things

753
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
and so that leads to a lot of legacy

754
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,799
hardware um

755
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,520
protocols designed in 1970s and 1980s i

756
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
was talking with a vendor yesterday we

757
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,440
were

758
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
very excited because there was a new

759
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
technology based uh a new

760
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,320
physical layer for ethernet we're all

761
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
excited about how this is gonna change

762
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
how we wire plants up and everything

763
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,039
like that it's gonna be very exciting

764
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
and then we plan to just shove the

765
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
normal sort of 1980s protocols down

766
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,600
those wires

767
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
uh and not learn from many mistakes in

768
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,799
terms of like security and that kind of

769
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,600
stuff

770
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
uh a lot of the controllers we deal with

771
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
are so old that they don't lack the

772
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
they lack the computational heart uh

773
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
horsepower uh to do any sort of

774
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,360
encryption so

775
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
authentication all that kind of stuff is

776
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
off the table um

777
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
and then we're stuck with providing all

778
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
sorts of backwards compatibility

779
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
and that leads to lots of cyber security

780
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,559
compromises

781
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,400
so once we have that equipment because

782
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,679
these systems are so large and

783
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
complicated we almost always have to

784
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,480
have some vendor

785
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
that supports it on large installations

786
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,960
a lot of times those vendors actually

787
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,520
embed

788
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,240
engineers and technicians on site to

789
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,600
help with issues

790
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,120
but many of the other ones are coming in

791
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,880
through remote means

792
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,320
the oldsmar water attack that happened

793
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
in february of this year

794
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
was through of course the famous team

795
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
viewer software that gives

796
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
people trouble um but maybe it's as

797
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,279
simple as some sort of vpn into

798
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,760
into a control network somewhere and how

799
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
about patches well

800
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,720
here's a a well-known patch from this

801
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,200
past

802
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
year so this is came out in august so

803
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
about a year ago

804
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
when this came out microsoft said you

805
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,400
know this is uh

806
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
it's got a cvss score of 10.0 absolutely

807
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,400
critical you need to get this patched on

808
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
as soon as possible

809
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
uh vendors then on in the control system

810
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,720
community are saying

811
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,039
wait a minute uh we need plenty of time

812
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
to test this because you can't just

813
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
throw in a patch and then hope that it

814
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
doesn't actually affect the ability for

815
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,039
our

816
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
system to make sure that your reactor

817
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
doesn't blow up or something like that

818
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
and so we typically see six weeks eight

819
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
weeks or something like that before the

820
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
vendors give us an okay

821
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
even though it's an absolutely critical

822
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,080
patch and so we're typically months

823
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,799
behind

824
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,400
at best for patching and even then it's

825
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
usually months behind

826
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
when we get the okay for patching and

827
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
then you're trying to schedule okay when

828
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,559
do we actually have down

829
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,400
time um when we have down time to go

830
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,840
ahead and apply these patches and so

831
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
forth

832
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,039
so critical to understanding that

833
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,400
2017 attack is to see that

834
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,039
both cyber security and engineers use

835
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
defense in depth

836
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
as a defensive strategy and

837
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
the defense in depth on the engineering

838
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,640
side looks something like this we

839
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
frequently call it layer of protection

840
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,279
analysis

841
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,200
and maybe this is the first time you see

842
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
it but if you think about it you've

843
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,159
actually experienced this in a number of

844
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,279
different products

845
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
okay so the first thing we need to do

846
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
with an engineering system

847
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
is with an engineered system is our

848
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
process design our design

849
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,600
scenario here has to involve making the

850
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,480
thing

851
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,159
as safe and easy to operate

852
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,400
from a first principles physics point of

853
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
view as possible

854
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,039
so we don't want something that explodes

855
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,919
all the time

856
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,840
we need to design it so it is very

857
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,200
stable and that's purely from

858
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
thermodynamics and that's from laws of

859
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
kinematics it's from the basic laws of

860
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
physics you want to use

861
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
those to your advantage as much as

862
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,440
possible to design a nice stable system

863
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
but stable systems don't do enough to

864
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
actually get you what you need and so

865
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,600
then

866
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,720
you add a process control system or

867
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
industrial control system to move them

868
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,480
in the direction that you want

869
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
so this turns on heat somewhere makes

870
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,559
something move a motor move or allows

871
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,880
the turbine and a power plant to move or

872
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,679
something like that

873
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
and so we have computational control

874
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,039
computer control

875
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,600
of the process allowing then um things

876
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,559
to be controlled

877
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,039
and and um but done in a very careful

878
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,600
way

879
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,039
to obtain obtain our goals but in a safe

880
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,320
manner

881
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,039
if that process control fails however we

882
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,039
have a third layer of defense then

883
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,000
and that's we start to have alarms or

884
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,640
events

885
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
happen and that is screaming for humans

886
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,399
to get involved we call that operator

887
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,360
intervention

888
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,039
and so this is at the classic claxons

889
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,399
and warning bells and everything like

890
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,279
that saying

891
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
something's going wrong and the the

892
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
industrial control system isn't quite

893
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
able to bring it back

894
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
um to a safe state people need to get

895
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,320
involved at this point

896
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,960
over the last few decades we've added a

897
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
separate system on top of that

898
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,399
which is a second control system and it

899
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,520
needs to be

900
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
disconnected it needs to be separate

901
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
from our traditional

902
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
control system this is your last line of

903
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
defense before

904
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
bad things happen and the safety

905
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
instrumented system or sis

906
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,720
is there to shut down things

907
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
as safely as possible and so whereas the

908
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
traditional control system

909
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
involves some really great and really

910
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
interesting math a lot of people use

911
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,320
neural networks and everything like that

912
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
the safety instrument system is very

913
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
boolean it's if this happens

914
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,559
then shut it down if this reading looks

915
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,919
bad then do this

916
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,360
you know prevent this explosion from

917
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
happening by releasing pressure and

918
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,880
these things like that it's usually if

919
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,919
then kind of

920
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
saying statements then if your sis

921
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,640
system fails then we've officially

922
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,080
gone into a phase where we need some

923
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
sort of mitigation and then this

924
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
typically is we've designed our

925
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,480
equipment

926
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
to fail in such a way that it fails

927
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,440
relatively safely so we have

928
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,880
parts of our equipment that might

929
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,200
rupture or break in a certain way that

930
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
it releases energy in a safe manner

931
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,679
but that point is permanent damage um

932
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,120
you'll have to shut down

933
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
so then we have this act of protection

934
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
that happens once we start stepping into

935
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,000
the incident phase

936
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,360
after that you're thinking like well

937
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,880
what can the building contain or what

938
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
can i do with geographical structures

939
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,520
around me um

940
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
dikes and buns and that those kinds of

941
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,360
things and if it gets out of hand even

942
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
more then we have the full-on

943
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
emergency response so these attackers at

944
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,840
this petroleum refinery seem to be going

945
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
all the way to this

946
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,600
emergency response so they're hoping to

947
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
get all the way

948
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
there and cause some real damage to the

949
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,799
system

950
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,640
and so we can compare this to something

951
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
like a self-driving car at the base

952
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,559
level this process design i want my car

953
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,480
to be as stable as possible i want it

954
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
as it drives down the road to drive

955
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
straight i want to go around the corner

956
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,840
i don't want it to flip over and all

957
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
these kinds of things that's what we're

958
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
talking about we want to try to make

959
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,360
things from a physical point of view

960
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,159
from a

961
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,919
laws of physics point of view to be as

962
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,760
safe as possible and then if it's a

963
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
self-driving car this next step

964
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
up would be we'd have some sort of

965
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,320
algorithm that's going to keep it

966
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
between the lanes move it around objects

967
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
and these kinds of things

968
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
but along the way if there's any sort of

969
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,640
failure of that self-driving mechanism

970
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
operators are going to so that's the

971
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
human behind the wheel it's going to

972
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
beep at them and say you need to take

973
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,080
the wheel you need to take over so

974
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,279
that's the operator invention

975
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,799
intervention stage

976
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,120
the safety systems side would be they're

977
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,840
usually

978
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,960
radar driven brakes on cars that are

979
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
braking systems that are on cars that

980
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,399
say i'm about to hit something i'm just

981
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,480
going to hit the brakes for you because

982
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,399
it looks really bad and so that would be

983
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,520
akin to the sis

984
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
that we have here after that you start

985
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,039
to have crumple zones in your car for

986
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,799
the active production

987
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,320
airbags and all these different things

988
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
as you build up to full-on emergency

989
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,559
response

990
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,520
okay so this triceps incident overview

991
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
major petrochemical

992
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,520
4000 acres in size sis shuts down

993
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,399
suddenly

994
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,200
a saturday evening in june vendor comes

995
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,919
out resets

996
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,000
the trichonyx was the brand name of the

997
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,080
sis so that's where the name trices

998
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,120
comes from is you

999
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
kind of it's a portmanteau of triconics

1000
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,399
and sis the

1001
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,440
sas shuts down again in august

1002
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,960
and which point that incident response

1003
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,240
teams are called because it's clear that

1004
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
something else is going on here

1005
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,120
and so since we're doing a talk at

1006
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
purdue we might as well talk about the

1007
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
purdue model which originated from

1008
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,799
theodore williams

1009
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
uh his work at purdue university in the

1010
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,159
1990s and

1011
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,399
his work says that control systems

1012
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,360
usually segregate

1013
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,159
or segment into these natural breaks and

1014
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
these natural levels of operation

1015
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
so if we're going to design some sort of

1016
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279
network architecture then let's mimic

1017
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,200
those natural breaks that we see

1018
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,120
in control systems so at the top we have

1019
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
sort of an enterprise network

1020
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,159
most of these are nowadays connected to

1021
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,760
your enterprise network or your

1022
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
corporate network

1023
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,279
allowing free flow of information to

1024
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,080
engineers

1025
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,559
and bullying and financing these kinds

1026
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,120
of things

1027
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,279
at the base level level zero is where i

1028
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,039
have my uh crown jewels

1029
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,279
uh robots turbines reactors and all

1030
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,880
these different things that connect into

1031
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,399
the controllers that are down there at

1032
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,000
level one

1033
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,559
okay and so over here i've now added the

1034
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,080
sis notice the sis

1035
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,159
is not connected to the network uh

1036
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,240
ideally it's not connected to your your

1037
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,880
control system network um maybe you have

1038
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,360
some

1039
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
read-only controls or something like

1040
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
that so you get an idea of what's uh

1041
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
what what the sis controller is actually

1042
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,080
doing but for the most part we want to

1043
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,919
have that kind of off to its side

1044
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,440
and so we start to talk to students

1045
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,799
about this whether they're the cyber

1046
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,559
security students or whether the

1047
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,159
the engineering students we built up

1048
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,840
this background and say okay

1049
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,039
now what's going to happen with the

1050
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,480
attack well the first phase of the

1051
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,519
attack

1052
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
is very conventional vpn's compromise

1053
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,320
perhaps through credentials or something

1054
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,120
like that

1055
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
allows them to get into the corporate

1056
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,159
network

1057
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,080
after a while on the corporate network

1058
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
then they're able to find the right

1059
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
credentials

1060
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,760
that would let them into uh into the

1061
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
control network

1062
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,720
and so with the right credentials they

1063
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,159
were able to in this case

1064
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,600
remote desktops windows root mode

1065
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,559
desktop protocol allow them to get

1066
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,159
further and deeper into the control

1067
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
network and we see then compromised

1068
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,120
credentials we see things like um there

1069
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
are misconfigurations of the firewalls

1070
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
allowing traffic to go much deeper than

1071
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,799
it should have been able to go

1072
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,240
especially from the corporate network

1073
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,519
and so forth and so we see these

1074
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,320
different effects

1075
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,399
and different groups whether they're

1076
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,840
more cyber security oriented or more

1077
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,880
engineering

1078
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,399
oriented we might emphasize different

1079
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,919
things here but this is a very nice

1080
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,720
attack

1081
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,080
our very nice a case study for this

1082
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,640
attack

1083
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
and so one of the frequently uh one

1084
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,240
question that almost everybody botches

1085
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
whether they're more versed in cyber

1086
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,799
security or more versed in the

1087
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,919
engineering side of things

1088
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,240
how long do attackers dwell in a network

1089
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,200
in days

1090
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,480
or sorry in in time so minutes hours

1091
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,440
days weeks and

1092
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
get a show of hands and stuff like that

1093
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,159
and allow students to kind of banter

1094
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,600
back and forth and try to get

1095
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,080
an idea of what's going on and almost

1096
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,640
everybody

1097
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,000
says minutes to hours and so i show them

1098
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,559
this

1099
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,880
from fireeye mandiant then median dwell

1100
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,240
time in days

1101
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
they've been tracking this that as we've

1102
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
gotten better at

1103
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
detecting um incidents

1104
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
that this dwell time has gone down but

1105
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
we're still talking

1106
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,720
weeks to months sometimes

1107
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
and so that's a critical piece that a

1108
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,640
lot of our students are missing

1109
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,600
that this gives attackers a long time to

1110
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
move laterally through networks find the

1111
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
right credentials and then move

1112
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,560
deeper into a process and find ways

1113
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,760
especially when it's something as

1114
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,839
targeted as what happened here

1115
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,480
in 2017. so this is a really crucial

1116
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
piece that people were missing is

1117
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,918
how long attackers will actually stay in

1118
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,879
your networks than collecting

1119
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
information on everybody

1120
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
and this really drives a home apart and

1121
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,918
the engineers especially are shocked by

1122
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,719
this because

1123
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,960
there'll be a piece later on that that's

1124
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
critical to this information

1125
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,879
so as the attackers are moving through

1126
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,639
these networks

1127
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,280
they get down to the low level and they

1128
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
basically have control the process which

1129
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,719
means they could in theory either shut

1130
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,359
the process

1131
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,359
down or they could steer it into an

1132
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,440
unsafe state what i mean by that is that

1133
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
you would be able to use the control

1134
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,679
system to push things

1135
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,839
to operate unsafely if you wanted to but

1136
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,679
of course the safety system would say

1137
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
hey that doesn't make any sense once

1138
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,480
shut everything down

1139
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,760
so the goal at this point by the

1140
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
attackers was to shut down the scs

1141
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,599
however the sas wasn't connected in a

1142
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,960
very straightforward way

1143
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
and so they have to think of a different

1144
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,160
way to

1145
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,079
shut that piece down and get that remove

1146
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,599
that piece

1147
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,599
from the board and so i asked the

1148
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,800
students

1149
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
cyber security students and engineering

1150
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,839
students like what would you do at this

1151
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,040
point they kind of sit there and they're

1152
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,920
stumped

1153
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
and then we show them the incident

1154
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,280
report and it just comes down to social

1155
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
engineering

1156
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
most likely uh the attackers masqueraded

1157
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
as another person within the institut

1158
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,640
within that institution and simply

1159
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,079
emailed saying hey would you mind

1160
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,240
installing this piece of software

1161
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,880
on the sis station for us and gave it an

1162
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,680
official

1163
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,320
name trilog.exe and said hey would you

1164
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
mind doing that for me and that really

1165
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,240
hits home with the engineers that that

1166
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
people could be

1167
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,880
masquerading as someone else that would

1168
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,800
be in your own organization

1169
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
sending you malicious things to install

1170
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
and and i look at them and say but i

1171
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,960
don't understand

1172
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,640
um from an engineering point of view if

1173
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,000
i asked you to go in and

1174
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,920
make a change to the piping to the

1175
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,680
electrical work or somehow

1176
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,880
something else with the process you'd

1177
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
say well i need to get approval for that

1178
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,160
we need to document that and stuff like

1179
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,119
that but

1180
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
installing rogue software wouldn't don't

1181
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
the same rules apply

1182
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
now the cyber security students sit back

1183
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
and just kind of laugh and say ha ha you

1184
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,280
know

1185
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,680
like this was we built up this and it

1186
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
was almost stopped but those pesky

1187
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
engineers were fooled into installing

1188
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
malicious software for us and said wait

1189
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,079
a minute so

1190
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,400
but don't get too cocky over there

1191
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,240
because the next piece of the puzzle

1192
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
as people were starting to look into

1193
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
this and and reverse engineering

1194
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
uh the software used to work with that

1195
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,160
sis controller

1196
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,119
hard-coded credentials show up allowing

1197
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,160
a complete

1198
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,119
uh literally a back door it's it's

1199
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,839
literally

1200
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,920
denoted as back door within the software

1201
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
so if you get a hold of the software

1202
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,119
and you just look for a string in there

1203
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,880
back door there it is that you can

1204
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
enable with hard-coded credentials and

1205
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,520
then suddenly

1206
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
that very easy attack so maybe

1207
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,040
developers need to

1208
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
not get so cocky at it when engineers

1209
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,640
make mistakes because these things pop

1210
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
up as well

1211
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,800
so that's a really good incident we walk

1212
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,720
through and it's informative for both

1213
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,560
cyber security students that aren't as

1214
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,079
well versed with critical infrastructure

1215
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,920
and with engineers who aren't diverse

1216
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,680
with cyber security

1217
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,839
um and of course then these these two

1218
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,359
events where this sis

1219
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,520
shuts down that's where the attackers

1220
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,680
then are trying to override the firmware

1221
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,079
of the controllers the sas controllers

1222
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,800
and ultimately

1223
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
failed both times and so that was good

1224
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,800
and then they gave themselves away

1225
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
by uh having firmware that failed

1226
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,200
um on two occasions but you know what

1227
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,240
the engineers have been here before

1228
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
we've had massive industrial accidents

1229
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
for decades

1230
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
and we looked at that and we did a

1231
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,079
little bit of self-reflection said

1232
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
this highlights deficiencies in the way

1233
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,280
we teach engineers

1234
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
engineering accidents like bhopal india

1235
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
or or some of the more

1236
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,560
um the oil recovery or the oil uh

1237
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
petrochem recovery stuff piper alpha

1238
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
deepwater horizon

1239
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,079
uh refinery stuff like bp texas city and

1240
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,440
these kind of stuff so

1241
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
we had this call to action make drastic

1242
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,280
changes to the way we teach

1243
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
process safety to engineers and so we've

1244
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,280
been working for a long time then

1245
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
updating the engineering curriculum

1246
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,320
um how do we add process safety

1247
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,480
throughout the curriculum and we bolster

1248
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
that by instance of industrial safety

1249
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,440
um accidents and so forth and she would

1250
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
be doing the same thing then to increase

1251
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,240
awareness of

1252
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,079
cyber security and then obviously the

1253
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,760
thing is i believe we should i should

1254
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
i think we should be taking the same

1255
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
approach and and maybe even just taking

1256
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,760
the

1257
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
as we build in more and more process

1258
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,119
safety into curriculums

1259
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,400
we should build more and more cyber

1260
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,640
security into that as well

1261
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
and so there's becomes a philosophical

1262
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,000
curriculum question

1263
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and you know one of the questions that

1264
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,599
we have here um

1265
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
in in the chat you know finally got it

1266
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,280
got around to it

1267
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,480
um how do we train

1268
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,359
engineers and how do we get this um

1269
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,800
curriculum changes that we might

1270
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,560
consider so hopefully we're here to

1271
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,920
answer your questions james at this

1272
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
point now it took me a while to get here

1273
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
but we're here

1274
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,680
so one philosophical discussion you can

1275
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,839
have is should we do this in terms of

1276
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,760
should we have students take like a

1277
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
dedicated course

1278
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
in this area say real is focus for one

1279
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
semester one quarter whatever it is or

1280
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,359
multiple quarters maybe

1281
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,359
uh class one elective one and elective

1282
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,720
two or something like that

1283
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,359
or should you make it nice and modular

1284
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,040
and then spread it out into lots of

1285
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,560
different courses so as you're working

1286
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,000
on different elements

1287
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
you say oh by the way here is the cyber

1288
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,480
security part and then work that into

1289
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,079
your analysis because that's the path

1290
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,200
we've chosen for

1291
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,520
process safety and we've been very happy

1292
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
with it

1293
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,160
so this we call that safety across the

1294
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,560
curriculum and so it spans all four

1295
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,720
years all four years of engineering then

1296
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
now gets process safety spread out

1297
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,320
through it

1298
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,240
whether it's hands-on stuff or more of a

1299
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,079
traditional lecture class

1300
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,480
there are modules that we bring in and

1301
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,680
make students work with

1302
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,960
and so if you're designing something

1303
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,760
maybe it's on the computer or on paper

1304
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
um even then you're going to have this

1305
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
piece where it says well now go through

1306
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,599
and

1307
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,800
tell me um how safe is your is your

1308
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,280
process

1309
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,160
is it going to lead to any sort of

1310
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,680
incidents and then how do we mitigate

1311
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
those things and from the beginning

1312
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,040
make sure that happens and on the

1313
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,440
hands-on stuff before people turn on any

1314
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
equipment

1315
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880
or do any sort of laboratory they have a

1316
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
number of things they need to do before

1317
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,119
they can

1318
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,119
um before they're cleared to do it

1319
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,640
anything like that so we do a

1320
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,040
hazards and risks uh inventory worksheet

1321
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,079
or something like that

1322
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,440
we also do indeed offer a full course

1323
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,040
in uh process safety uh that's typically

1324
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
taught to juniors and above

1325
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
we were worried that that's a little bit

1326
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,119
too late we'd like to see younger

1327
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:43,920
students then

1328
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,800
get exposed to those concepts beforehand

1329
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,440
um

1330
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
but if you want to take that elective

1331
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,319
course because potentially that's a

1332
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,359
career choice you want to make because

1333
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,800
you want to be a safety officer

1334
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
then we have that elective course as

1335
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,079
well so i

1336
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,839
i've been proposing an idea of cyber

1337
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,000
security across the curriculum

1338
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
especially on the engineering side and i

1339
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,839
think that's applicable to many stem

1340
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
majors

1341
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,440
on the cs or software engineering

1342
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,880
infosec

1343
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
curriculum how would those change well i

1344
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,079
think we'd like to make

1345
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,119
as many modules and as many experiences

1346
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,200
as possible with critical infrastructure

1347
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
amenable to them as well so hands-on

1348
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,960
experience with cyber security best

1349
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
practices and labs for

1350
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,720
stem students modules and learning

1351
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,319
assignments and traditional classroom

1352
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,119
courses

1353
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,640
and then have that split where we have

1354
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,240
lots of people that are people that are

1355
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,480
really versed in cyber security

1356
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,319
being able to work with some critical

1357
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,520
infrastructure see what's different

1358
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
about it basically

1359
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
and get some uh time potentially

1360
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
hands-on with some of it there

1361
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,440
and then on the other side we have

1362
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,800
engineers that are actually designing it

1363
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,920
saying how do we

1364
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,680
build up our cyber security skills and

1365
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,000
then um what kind of design

1366
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,400
a curriculum can we build in that

1367
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,920
betters cyber security

1368
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,280
and make sure that things move along

1369
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,359
nicely when they're doing designs

1370
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,200
so real quick though what about existing

1371
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,760
resources can we leverage them

1372
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,599
there are a number of institutions doing

1373
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,160
fantastic cyber security education

1374
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
and there's been a huge growth in this

1375
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,839
area over the last 20 years

1376
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,440
and these are more independent

1377
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
institutions and frankly

1378
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,200
they're kicking the butt of a lot of

1379
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
higher education

1380
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,119
institutions in terms of very practical

1381
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,800
hands-on

1382
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,680
applied critical infrastructure

1383
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,599
especially cyber security and so i'll

1384
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,280
give a quick shout out to places like

1385
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,359
sands institute um

1386
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,040
in terms of like courses and search they

1387
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,400
have

1388
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,640
great courses for general cyber security

1389
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,599
but they're absolutely one of the

1390
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,359
leading sources for cyber security

1391
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,400
instruction in

1392
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,839
critical infrastructure industrial

1393
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,319
control systems and if you're down that

1394
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:40,720
path

1395
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,839
there are a number of different

1396
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,680
frameworks that you kind of have to deal

1397
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,359
with depending on

1398
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,440
your area if you're in in power then

1399
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
you're looking at nerc sip and these

1400
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,160
kinds of things

1401
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,000
nist has a number of frameworks that

1402
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,760
that you can look through

1403
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,240
um on the process side we're more of the

1404
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,800
isa

1405
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,680
iec 62 443 kind of thing and not only

1406
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,000
that

1407
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,160
sam's provides tons of free content on

1408
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,040
on youtube

1409
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,400
all sorts of stuff if you want to look

1410
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
at understanding um

1411
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
how protocols industrial protocols work

1412
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,400
and and if you wanted to like

1413
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,640
hey how could i pull that up and and

1414
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
look at modbus packets using wireshark

1415
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
it's there for you free on

1416
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,720
youtube absolutely great content

1417
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,440
likewise uh ics village

1418
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,920
this was more of a this is a non-profit

1419
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,440
dedicated to bolstering awareness of

1420
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,400
control system

1421
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,440
safety and security and it was a

1422
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
physical thing you'd find at lots of

1423
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
major conferences defcon rsa these kinds

1424
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,720
of things

1425
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
but they've done a phenomenal job in

1426
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,839
terms of having an online presence now a

1427
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:38,880
lot of educational

1428
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,280
resources are there online but they also

1429
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
have these great online virtual test

1430
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,480
beds and then they capture the flags and

1431
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,359
everything like that

1432
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,480
you just go to icsvillage.com

1433
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
so what is the role of higher education

1434
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,079
though um

1435
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,160
if we go back to that 1997 presidential

1436
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,920
report on general education

1437
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,760
we see that these deficiencies are

1438
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,960
supposed to be addressed

1439
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,800
for computer security in day-to-day

1440
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,000
operations so i'd

1441
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
say strike that part it's just

1442
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
deficiencies in general education we

1443
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,720
need to

1444
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,640
uh address so improve awareness

1445
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,160
with the infosec community to the needs

1446
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,480
of critical infrastructure by providing

1447
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,640
modules providing different ways for

1448
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,839
them to say what's

1449
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,160
different about critical infrastructure

1450
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,440
and how can i

1451
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
um how can i work with what i already

1452
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,680
know

1453
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,280
and extend that knowledge into critical

1454
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,960
infrastructure and then on the other

1455
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,440
side

1456
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,640
the people that are more likely to

1457
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,119
design with it or operate it

1458
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,760
improve cyber security skills of them

1459
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,280
and then create a pipeline so if you

1460
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,960
want to get more specialized in these

1461
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
these places like sands ics village and

1462
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,400
stuff like that these can be great

1463
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,520
destinations

1464
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,240
but build some of the more build some

1465
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,359
critical

1466
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,920
knowledge basis for more of the general

1467
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,680
population so that they end up in these

1468
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,280
these great places where they have more

1469
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,040
specialized instruction

1470
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
or maybe that's academic research so we

1471
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,400
build up more phd students

1472
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,839
and our master's degree students or some

1473
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,520
of that so we've been building a

1474
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,240
critical

1475
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,839
critical infrastructure laboratory here

1476
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,920
where we study modernization of

1477
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,720
legacy infrastructure we look at

1478
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,319
emerging technologies we look at

1479
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,240
applications of data science to process

1480
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,720
and

1481
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
to process automation and data um so

1482
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,079
this is

1483
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,440
typically what our chemical engineering

1484
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,200
lab looks like students come in and work

1485
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,760
with this

1486
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,839
and i've been making offers to cs and

1487
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,520
software engineering students to come in

1488
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,560
and try this out

1489
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,599
if you've ever wanted to run a

1490
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,359
distillation column great come in we'll

1491
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,079
do it

1492
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,119
and i think that that that's a great

1493
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,240
opportunity

1494
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,640
um for people to come in and do that uh

1495
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,000
we've been doing we haven't

1496
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,680
had a whole lot of people in the lab

1497
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,119
mainly because of covid

1498
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,880
and we've been limiting the numbers but

1499
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,720
i hope that in this new academic year

1500
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,760
we'll have that change

1501
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,000
we've invited the cyber security club at

1502
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,680
rosehoma to come in and work here

1503
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,000
we do guest lectures and stuff like that

1504
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,440
uh walk through the lab and everything

1505
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,319
like that

1506
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,920
so the goal of this critical

1507
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,680
infrastructure laboratory is to

1508
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,960
provide hands-on experience with

1509
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,560
critical infrastructures to various

1510
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,680
disciplines not just

1511
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,480
engineers and then allow those engineers

1512
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,760
to get a flavor of what it's

1513
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
like to work with otit software

1514
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,240
engineers and vice versa

1515
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,680
but also provide some really interesting

1516
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,200
assessment opportunities on the cyber

1517
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,000
security team

1518
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,440
vulnerabilities assessments and these

1519
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
kinds of things and ultimately

1520
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,839
um lead to some sort of continuous

1521
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,880
improvement

1522
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,720
just keep making our facilities better

1523
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
and better informed by

1524
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,480
needs on the engineering side and needs

1525
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
on the cyber security side

1526
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
so interested students then can take a

1527
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,000
number of different looks at

1528
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,720
host network intrusion detection asset

1529
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,319
scanning and these kinds of things and

1530
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,520
there's all sorts of cool software

1531
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,440
dedicated on the ot side for asset

1532
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,400
scanning because

1533
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
a lot of ot assets tend to be very

1534
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,640
fragile they don't have very robust tcp

1535
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,839
stacks and so

1536
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,240
you push them too hard you scan them too

1537
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,920
hard they might fall over so that's kind

1538
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,440
of an interesting learning thing

1539
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,680
which we purposely do every now and then

1540
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,200
uh different security assessments and

1541
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,839
these different things

1542
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,480
in terms of lecture classes just grab

1543
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,000
them early as soon as we start

1544
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,520
talking about intro to programming on

1545
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
the engineering side almost every

1546
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,240
programming

1547
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,480
intro to programming class devolves into

1548
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,119
some sort of mathematics class

1549
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,000
uh here's how you would work with this

1550
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,760
curve fitting regression these different

1551
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,480
things like that

1552
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
and so oftentimes we'll have them go out

1553
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
and find a data set pull it in

1554
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,160
work with it so from right there in the

1555
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,800
get-go how do we start to think about

1556
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,000
ways of handling um

1557
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,760
credentials like securing credentials

1558
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
and all these different things

1559
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,319
a lot of these things are in jupyter

1560
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,680
notebooks and so my students would love

1561
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,720
to share them up and

1562
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,240
start to post these things to github

1563
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,240
which is phenomenal and so

1564
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,680
talking about stuff like okay what if

1565
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,520
you goof and you put credentials then up

1566
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,319
on github

1567
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,160
here's an example of someone that tried

1568
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,440
that um

1569
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,839
they leaked it was it was an intentional

1570
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,599
thing they built a honeypot

1571
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,440
where in their honeypot they were sorry

1572
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
they built a honeypot and then

1573
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,880
they built a github repository where

1574
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,520
they made a commit that included an

1575
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,160
ssh username and password key and i

1576
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,839
included the username and password right

1577
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,520
there in the middle of the screen

1578
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,160
and so it's not a not an obvious user

1579
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,440
deploy button

1580
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,760
and the password most people would look

1581
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,880
at that password and say well that's

1582
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,480
pretty good randomized

1583
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,280
password right there and so he then ran

1584
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
this experiment how long does it take

1585
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,480
before someone is able to get into uh

1586
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,760
via ssh into the honeypot uh he sees the

1587
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,160
first people brute force attacking it

1588
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,240
within 68 seconds which actually matches

1589
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,839
with my colleagues that teach using

1590
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,839
raspberry pi's if it's not on

1591
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,359
on an unsecured network and you've

1592
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
installed a raspberry pi with default

1593
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,240
credentials they estimate it's minutes

1594
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,079
then before someone's

1595
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,720
into that device but the first time that

1596
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,880
someone used those lead credentials so

1597
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,760
they found it on github and then they

1598
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,400
find

1599
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
the device and then start to use those

1600
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
credentials it took about a half an hour

1601
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,960
between the commit on github and that so

1602
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,359
working these concepts into the earliest

1603
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,640
programming classes and making these

1604
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,800
modules along the way that build up

1605
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,400
um i think it's absolutely crucial

1606
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,079
so real quick i'll finish with some

1607
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,280
conclusions it looks like we've got some

1608
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,319
questions over here i'd be

1609
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,960
i'm excited to answer um so we see an

1610
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,599
explosion

1611
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,000
of cyber security incidents related to

1612
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,200
critical infrastructure

1613
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,280
and i think those highlights a dire need

1614
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,920
to invest in relationships

1615
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,800
expose engineers to cyber security

1616
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,559
concepts but also

1617
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,760
vice versa expand available the

1618
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,520
critical infrastructure facilities and

1619
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,599
training to people outside of the

1620
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,960
traditional engineering

1621
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,520
fields come run a distillation column

1622
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,559
i'd love to have you there

1623
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,839
or i'd love to just come and talk to

1624
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,200
your class it could be virtual or

1625
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,480
something like that

1626
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,079
and along the way we need to start

1627
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,079
creating more modular multi-disciplinary

1628
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,520
content that educates on critical

1629
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,559
infrastructure

1630
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,000
and how we can protect it so

1631
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,839
with that i'll thank their sponsors of

1632
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,839
our of our laboratory

1633
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,960
space here and

1634
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,720
i'm happy to answer any questions i'll

1635
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,240
give you my email address and

1636
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,000
link to the website okay

1637
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,319
so so far we've got a couple questions

1638
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,440
or a handful of questions

1639
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
um

1640
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,559
let's say to play devil's advocate what

1641
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,240
percentage of the workforce

1642
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,280
uh working critical infrastructure yeah

1643
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,920
that's the thing i think it'd be great

1644
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,480
if we

1645
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,920
provided a baseline education that in

1646
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,520
case you went to work for one of these

1647
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:33,920
things

1648
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,800
that you would know some basic concepts

1649
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,680
and

1650
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,800
you would know where to continue

1651
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,720
your education on so you'd probably go

1652
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,880
either back for masters or phd with

1653
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,520
somebody

1654
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,000
or more likely you'd go to work you'd go

1655
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,520
and start working on certificates in

1656
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,480
certain areas and

1657
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,960
so forth but we do i think need a

1658
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,559
baseline education or we do need some

1659
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,119
baseline

1660
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,079
education and knowledge base for a lot

1661
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,200
more of our students because it's

1662
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,319
clearly a problem

1663
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,559
that we're having with critical

1664
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,640
infrastructure

1665
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,920
so should we be integrating this

1666
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,839
material into a general edu

1667
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,280
engineering curriculum yeah absolutely

1668
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,520
yeah

1669
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,680
earlier in the presentation they

1670
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,119
mentioned that we weren't budgeting

1671
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,880
enough for critical infrastructure

1672
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,440
upgrades

1673
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,640
absolutely yeah um when i do

1674
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,240
i've given a talk before where you talk

1675
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
walk through how you would design

1676
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,880
a piece of of equipment as an engineer

1677
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
and if it costs a million dollars

1678
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,880
i'll say i need 20 on top of that we

1679
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,800
used to just use a figure 20

1680
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,240
typically and that's going to be how

1681
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
much the control system is going to cost

1682
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,319
me

1683
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,240
and then we'll add another 20 fudge

1684
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,000
factor on top of that

1685
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
that says um these are other things

1686
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,839
various things like it might be

1687
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,640
the network connections that allow for

1688
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,160
connection through dmz to like a

1689
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,079
corporate network or something like that

1690
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,599
but there's also a ton of other things

1691
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,400
there's just it's 20 miscellaneous costs

1692
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,920
so we're not really budgeting for how we

1693
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,400
can do

1694
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,240
upgrades my students if they design a

1695
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,000
reactor they'll tell me after four years

1696
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,680
i need to take apart this reactor

1697
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,399
take out the most

1698
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,559
before we're going to have a little bit

1699
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,240
extra downtime because we need to fix

1700
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,280
these things like that

1701
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,599
but none of that for control system

1702
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,960
upgrades or anything like that

1703
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,200
so it says should the infrastructure

1704
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,800
simply not be built because it isn't

1705
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,440
profitable

1706
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,119
if we perform all the upgrades no

1707
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,559
obviously we need to build it

1708
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,920
but we should probably rethink the

1709
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,079
budgeting process and say we need to

1710
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:40,960
actually

1711
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
contribute and carve out more research

1712
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,640
sources from the beginning

1713
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,720
to make sure that we have the ability to

1714
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
safely run this equipment for

1715
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,160
years and years we do that on the

1716
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,920
process safety side we make sure that we

1717
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,559
have the

1718
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,200
the resources needed to run it safely we

1719
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,760
should

1720
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,640
think about the budgetary resources to

1721
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,559
make sure that it stays from a cyber

1722
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,359
security

1723
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,558
point of view safe as well

1724
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,880
all right so hopefully answered the the

1725
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,839
chat questions so far

1726
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,280
maybe the the talk in the in the chat is

1727
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,440
is was duplicated in the uh the q a

1728
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,280
session so i think we're up to date on

1729
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,920
that but

1730
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,079
uh we do have a few more minutes if

1731
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,240
anybody wanted to pose an additional

1732
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:43,839
question or comment

1733
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
so be happy to talk with anybody about

1734
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,000
critical infrastructure

1735
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,920
to give you tours of the laboratory or

1736
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,680
maybe you know even virtual or something

1737
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,040
like that

1738
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,319
give you some experience potentially

1739
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,880
with some control systems

1740
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,319
and what it's like what's different

1741
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,480
about it if you've never experienced

1742
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,640
how you program say a plc or something

1743
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,079
like that it's pretty wild

1744
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,319
uh the original logic controllers were

1745
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,440
all wired based

1746
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,599
it's wires and relays and that's

1747
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,040
mimicked now in the programming

1748
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,119
languages that used for plc's

1749
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,200
and so it's not like anything you've

1750
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,280
ever seen before i know i did

1751
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,160
several ai courses and got exposed to

1752
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,760
some really wild languages i never

1753
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,000
thought

1754
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,599
of before lisp and these different

1755
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,319
things but plc programming is a totally

1756
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,599
different beast with

1757
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,280
trying to look like trying to pretend

1758
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,200
that you've got this logic flowing down

1759
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,040
relays and wires even though you're

1760
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,720
writing it as code it's really wild it's

1761
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,839
cool but if you ever want to see

1762
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,480
anything like that

1763
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,920
so can i talk a little bit about the

1764
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,280
role of simulation and testing these

1765
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,640
systems that's great yeah

1766
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,240
we actually set up three different uh

1767
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,920
systems we set up a test system a

1768
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,680
development system and a production

1769
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,359
system in our laboratory

1770
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,040
and so we do a lot of simulation on um

1771
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,520
the test and development systems and so

1772
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,599
it's

1773
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,280
not just random signals or

1774
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,960
pre-programmed signals but we have

1775
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,319
signals that deviate

1776
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,160
and say that we have some sort of

1777
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
process vent that that's going awry

1778
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,240
um and so then we look at different

1779
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,520
control schemes on that

1780
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
especially on the safety instrument

1781
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,720
system side of it

1782
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,960
yeah i would love to add while you're

1783
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,440
reading the question david that

1784
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,480
at sirius we were lucky enough

1785
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,799
uh to receive a 10 million dollar

1786
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,319
donation from the department of energy

1787
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,000
that set up the solus

1788
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,200
laboratory which is uh

1789
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,000
emulating so emulation and analytics for

1790
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,079
cyber cyber physical systems

1791
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,599
uh so that would be an awful an area

1792
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,359
that uh we would love to be able to

1793
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,480
collaborate with

1794
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,559
anybody in the attendees list as well as

1795
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,400
well as with the professor

1796
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,599
uh thorne and his lab at rhode holman

1797
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,319
that sounds awesome

1798
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,200
and another question about how does your

1799
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,520
funding look like we are primarily in

1800
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,640
undergraduate

1801
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,160
institutions we have a few master's

1802
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,680
students it's mainly undergraduates and

1803
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,520
so we work very closely with companies

1804
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,359
and so you see that that list of

1805
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,520
of people who support the lab they tend

1806
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,599
to be

1807
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,040
large companies that support the

1808
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,720
laboratory

1809
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,520
and so we we mainly seek corporate

1810
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,200
funding for these things

1811
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,760
yeah but yeah as mentioned before the

1812
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,640
funding then

1813
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,359
there's certainly funding from a number

1814
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,760
of governmental agencies as well

1815
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,440
we're very much on the corporate side

1816
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,200
sonicwall just announced zero day flaws

1817
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,040
in their products

1818
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,359
i've never used any sonic wall product

1819
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:38,079
yeah

1820
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,280
um yeah i wouldn't be able to comment on

1821
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,839
that

1822
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
thanks

1823
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
well as we roll up at the bottom of the

1824
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,119
hour

1825
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,040
again will take this opportunity to say

1826
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,880
thank you both to our attendees for

1827
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,319
attending the talk today but

1828
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,480
but specifically to our invited speaker

1829
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,000
david it was great to have you

1830
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,880
thanks i hope this as i mentioned before

1831
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
the talk that this is uh

1832
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,559
just the start of the relationship

1833
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,359
between our labs and your lab

1834
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,599
and collaboration to close out i wanted

1835
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,440
to mention a couple of comments

1836
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,640
one that we will have these

1837
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,799
weekly seminars on wednesday afternoon

1838
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,240
at 1 30 pm

1839
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,440
eastern continuing

1840
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,079
through the end of this month then we

1841
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,559
will go on to hiatus for a few weeks and

1842
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,400
pick these up at the start of the fall

1843
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,280
semester

1844
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,760
at purdue which our classes start august

1845
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,160
23rd so that would be like the 25th

1846
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,599
and you can get this off the off the

1847
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,119
internet but the 25th of august we'll

1848
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,480
