uh today team we're going to go ahead

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,640
and cover how to conduct cyber security

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
assessments so

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
i'm going to move very quickly but uh if

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,199
you stay with me

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,039
hopefully you'll come away with with a

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
new skill a new tool in your tool kit

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,720
so we're going to get started in the

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
presentation with scoping or trying to

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
understand the organization that you're

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
going to assess

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
we'll talk for quite a bit of time about

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
work paper so preparing for the

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
assessment before you arrive on site or

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,040
conduct

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
a remote assessment

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
we'll talk briefly about the report

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
and presenting findings and

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,159
recommendations to executives

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,560
and then we'll briefly cover future

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
assessments

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
uh beyond a program assessment which

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
we'll spend most of our time on

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,000
this presentation is designed for cyber

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
security students

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
as an audience

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
again i'm going to cover probably about

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
30 slides in a really short span of time

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,159
about 40 minutes

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,240
so i'll be using air force crash course

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
format and if you're not familiar with

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
that you're going to see me move through

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
many many slides uh please feel free to

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
ask questions at the end we'll leave

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,479
about

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,920
10 minutes or longer if if there's time

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,399
permitting within the organization and

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,200
also you we can have a one-on-one call

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,160
if we run out of time

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
so left to my own devices i like to

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
start cyber security program assessments

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
within this cyber security framework and

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
the reason being is

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
then this csf has

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,720
108 controls and when you're looking at

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
the totality of cyber security that's

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
not too many so it's manageable it helps

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,480
you

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
establish a foundation of

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,720
basic controls common controls

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
for your assessment

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
i also like that venus cyber security

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
framework provides a good presentation

73
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,040
layer for executives so

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
we're going to

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
identify threats and vulnerabilities

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
we're going to implement

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
preventive controls we're going to

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,879
detect suspicious activity we're going

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
to respond

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
leveraging our

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
incident response plan and we're going

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
to recover

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
go through lessons learned and we'll

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
move back to a normal state business as

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
usual so if you noticed i didn't get off

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
into the traditional cyber security

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,799
domains

88
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,799
such as

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
access control or physical security we

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
start to leave the executives behind

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
i i covered that and leveraging

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
um the the overlay that nist provides i

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,879
was able to cover that more in terms

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
that would resonate with an executive so

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
that will benefit you as well

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
next we're going to transition and we're

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
going to talk about preparing for the

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,840
assessment

99
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,239
um scoping is really an exercise where

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
you're trying to understand what the

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
organization is

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
their assets their critical services

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,200
typically what i'll do to start off with

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
is i will do research on the internet

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,279
as an adversary might do by the way

106
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,519
and i'll go on the organization's

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,240
website i try to understand at least how

108
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
do they promote themselves

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
what products and services do they

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
offer i'll also go through

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
and look at if they have an area of for

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
news or press releases i'm trying to see

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
if there's any new services or

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,880
technology about to come on board

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
are there any mergers and acquisitions

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,000
so in two or three hours i can get a

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
pretty good understanding of what the

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
organization is

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,759
at least from the outside

120
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,680
sometimes i might go to glassdoor i

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
might go to linkedin and poke around and

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
just see what i can learn

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
so finally once you've done that

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
you've got about as much information as

125
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
you're going to have

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
from internet research then i'll ask for

127
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
60 minutes

128
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
with the it and business leaders of the

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
organization and i'll prepare

130
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
about 20 questions for the 60-minute

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,240
call

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
and really what i'm looking to do is

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,440
just give a little bit deeper than what

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
i can find on the internet

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
so some of the questions i'll ask is

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
what types of sensitive data or assets

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
do you have sometimes you have to lead

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
them through what types of sensitive

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
data might be present

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
such as pii or or phi intellectual

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
property

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
i'll also start to ask where

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
that data is stored

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
which data centers they have where the

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
data center is located is the

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
organization

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
using heavily using cloud yet like

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,319
microsoft azure or aws are they heavily

149
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,960
leveraging third parties

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
and in general i'm just trying to

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
to gauge

152
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
where the sensitive data is stored

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
processed or transmitted

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
one of the questions that i always try

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,039
to leave time for at the end you can

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,800
prepare as much as

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
as you can

158
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
but um i'll ask

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
what are a few nightmare scenarios for

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
your organization so

161
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,880
we have to keep in mind that we're

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
dealing with

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
technology leaders business leaders that

164
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
have worked

165
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
in the organization for years so i want

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
to understand what keeps them up at

167
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,319
night

168
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
where do they feel like they have

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
exposures

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,880
have they had incidents before

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
and any kind of data breaches things

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
that are serious things that i should

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
know about and that kind of helps me

174
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
craft

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
assessment work papers

176
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
which we'll get into soon

177
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
so next we want to think

178
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199
logically about

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
given the type of business

180
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
the types of services the type of assets

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
that the organization has

182
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
logically what type of threat actors

183
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
might come after

184
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,520
that data or those assets

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
so i'm going to go over three categories

186
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,280
of threat actors yes there can be more

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,759
and it can be broken down further but

188
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
i think this is good for our purposes so

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
one we can have

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
nation states and

191
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
nation states

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
um oftentimes china for example are

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
looking to

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
grow their country economically so they

195
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
may go after

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
intellectual

197
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,520
properties such as

198
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
pipeline drug formulas

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
and

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
get get a hold of that information give

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,120
it to companies with in their country

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,000
and then those companies can bring

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
that product to market without incurring

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
all the costs of research and

205
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
development

206
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
there are times too where threat actors

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
will go after human resources and

208
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
clearance records typically that's of

209
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
government organizations they may also

210
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
go after critical infrastructure

211
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
election systems you see it in the news

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
and at some point

213
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,199
we may have to

214
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
contend with cyber warfare so it's

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
something to be mindful of depending on

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
what type of organization

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,399
you're assessing

218
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,640
many organizations need to worry about

219
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,519
organized crime or criminal enterprises

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
and their motivations are profit so

221
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
they'll come after financial accounts

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
they'll see

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
if they can

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
through social engineering

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
have someone

226
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,839
send a wire transfer overseas

227
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,720
fraudulently

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,360
they'll come after payment card data so

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
if your organization processes credit or

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,519
debit card numbers

231
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,839
adversaries will come for that they'll

232
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,760
also come after

233
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
pii personally identifiable information

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
and look to monetize that

235
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
every organization needs to worry about

236
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
insight or threat and there's a variety

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
of motivations there sometimes you can

238
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
have someone that's disgruntled or upset

239
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
with the organization sometimes you just

240
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,920
may have someone that's looking

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
to benefit themselves financially

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
and typically people are

243
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
targeting intellectual property

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
strategic plans

245
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
oftentimes

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,839
customer contacts are forgotten as

247
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
something that's valuable i mean it may

248
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
not be protected so we have to look for

249
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
that

250
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,279
obviously company funds

251
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
activists

252
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
typically aren't coming after an

253
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
organization right now but if something

254
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,720
hits the news

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
where

256
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
maybe a line of business or one of the

257
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
executives has done something

258
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
that is unethical

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
activists can get upset by that and

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
they'll either do denial of service

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,839
attacks

262
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
or they might disclose sensitive

263
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
documents so we can look in our

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
assessment to see

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
does the organization have a good crisis

266
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,360
communications plan and and some of

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
those other techniques

268
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
set up

269
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
so next we're going to get into work

270
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
papers and we're really

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
much deeper going to prepare for the

272
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
assessment at this point so as i

273
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
mentioned earlier

274
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
i like to start as i

275
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,880
design or architect an assessment for an

276
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
organization i like to start with the

277
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
nist csf as foundational or common

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
controls

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,839
and i'll use

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,600
work papers to prepare for the

281
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
assessment so this is a relatively

282
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,000
straightforward format

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
you're going to

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
have your question or test

285
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
in the beginning so

286
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
really three different things that you

287
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
may do

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
three different actions you may take to

289
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,959
validate a control

290
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
you may ask a question

291
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,600
you may look to observe the control

292
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,399
you may review a document or an artifact

293
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,640
or a screenshot

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
so obviously as much as you can

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
you want to observe the control to see

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,720
if it's in place or not or go through

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
documents or or artifacts or screenshots

298
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
evidence so that you're

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
really as much as you can having a fact

300
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,760
based assessment um that being said we

301
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
will ask questions as well

302
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,200
so the response results

303
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
feel there is where we're going to take

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
our notes as we go we're going to have

305
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
many hours of assessment activity and we

306
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
need to capture the details of whether a

307
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
control is in place or not

308
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,320
as we're thinking about validating a

309
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
given control such as

310
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
system hardening or encryption

311
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
you're going to want to focus on

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
which job function which person are you

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
going to validate that control with

314
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
so it's important to have that in your

315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
work papers

316
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
as you go along and you're conducting

317
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
the assessment controls are going to be

318
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
in place or not in place and you're

319
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
going to cover

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
perhaps four or five hundred controls so

321
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,440
as you go it makes sense to mark them in

322
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,160
place or not in place so it's easier for

323
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
you to

324
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,600
fill out the report

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
and also when you think in terms of

326
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
writing out findings it's good to cite

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,519
the control so we bake that right into

328
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
the work papers

329
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
in the the g column on the right

330
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
so next we're going to continue to flush

331
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
out those work papers

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
um

333
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,959
so you can see

334
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,040
the first main bullet there is one of

335
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
the 108

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
cyber security framework controls

337
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
i'm not going to just look to validate

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
that one control as written nor should

339
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
you so you can see we're flushing out a

340
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
little bit beyond that and we're getting

341
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,639
a little bit deeper uh is the full

342
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
contract language in place to mandate

343
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,200
compliance with security requirements so

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
i'm asking a question

345
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
if someone says yes we have default

346
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
contract language then i'm asking for a

347
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
copy of the default

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,399
contract language and and if you think

349
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,680
about that i'm pivoting now i've heard

350
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
that this is in place so someone

351
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
answered a question

352
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
now i want the artifact i want to i want

353
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
to be able to review something

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
as much as i can to to determine myself

355
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,199
not just from an answer to a question

356
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
whether that controls in place and to

357
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,639
what extent that controls in place

358
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,240
and in terms of default contract

359
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
language i'm probably going to spend two

360
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
or three hours reviewing that

361
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,199
and most times i will make

362
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,160
a recommendation to add

363
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
five to ten different topics

364
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
into that default contract language so

365
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
you need to have that level of attention

366
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
to detail

367
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,040
also uh what's the process if a supplier

368
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
or a vendor wants to redline or cross

369
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
out security contract language what i'm

370
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,399
looking for is that

371
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,160
say the legal team or the third party

372
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,839
risk management team is going to have

373
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
somebody with a cyber security

374
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
background get involved in that and for

375
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
example a vendor may say look the

376
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
services we're providing

377
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
don't really require that control it's

378
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
really not applicable to us would like

379
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,440
to strike it that may be reasonable you

380
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
have to make sure they're not

381
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
striking

382
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
controls that really should be in place

383
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
to protect your organization then also

384
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
does the process require the security

385
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
team

386
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,639
to review contracts pertaining to i.t

387
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
services and this is especially true

388
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
when the contract isn't written by our

389
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
organization it's written by the vendor

390
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
so we want to make sure

391
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,079
that either we can just take our default

392
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,160
contract language and put it in as an

393
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
addendum

394
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
or if they're reluctant to have us do

395
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
that we may have one of our security

396
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
professionals just kind of negotiate

397
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
peppering the same language in

398
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
throughout the contract so we need the

399
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
right people doing that work we need to

400
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
check for that in our assessment

401
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
we're continuing to flash out our work

402
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,079
papers and just some examples here

403
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,399
of security monitoring

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,560
and from a to f4 really kind of

405
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
increasing in maturity so we want to

406
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,079
make sure

407
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,680
as we're doing our assessment that we

408
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
confirm

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
that security logging and events are

410
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
centralized run operating systems

411
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
commercial software and custom

412
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,600
applications

413
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
we're also going to look to make sure

414
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,199
that there's a sim in place or log

415
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,560
monitoring so that there's software that

416
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
that parses through all the logging and

417
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
events that come through

418
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,880
and alert us to suspicious activity

419
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
we're checking to see if there's a sock

420
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
operation center

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
or something similar to that where you

422
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,920
have

423
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,480
cyber security personnel monitoring and

424
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,600
responding to suspicious events 24 7.

425
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
also we're looking to see if there's

426
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
some sort of threat hunting activity

427
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
that goes on where again you have a

428
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,600
cyber security professional that's

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
leveraging the sim and they're searching

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
for adversarial activity they're

431
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
searching for indicators of compromise

432
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,959
also what we're trying to understand

433
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
does this organization have

434
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,639
user behavior analytics so software that

435
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
looks to see

436
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,360
if

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,839
the behavior of the way that

438
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
an end user typically

439
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
uses computer systems and acts accesses

440
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,919
computer resources

441
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,559
um which systems they go to what times

442
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,199
they log in is any of that really

443
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,000
radically changing and if so we might

444
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
want to have someone take a look at that

445
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,160
so we're looking to see if user behavior

446
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,199
analytics software is in place

447
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,119
then finally probably the highest level

448
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
of maturity and you don't see this often

449
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,919
is is there a cyber fusion center in

450
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
place that shares threat intelligence

451
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
information between security operations

452
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,039
it operations and our development ops

453
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,320
teams

454
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
so i'm i'm not in all of this scene

455
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
all of these things must be in place and

456
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
if they're not in place their findings

457
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
in some cases these aren't foundational

458
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
controls that you'd find

459
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,400
in the cyber security framework

460
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
or similar control framework like iso so

461
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,200
we may make recommendations so breaking

462
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
things out between

463
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,039
a clear violation of a framework or the

464
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
policies or standards of the

465
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
organization and something that may just

466
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
be common sense or a best practice that

467
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,880
would probably be a recommendation

468
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,679
we're also continuing to flesh out our

469
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,240
work paper still in that mode so you

470
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
remember there was

471
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
one of the

472
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
four types of threat actors were was

473
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
the insider or insider threat so

474
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
a great resource for you to review

475
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
as cyber security professionals

476
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
is

477
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,880
certs common sense guide to mitigating

478
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
insider threats

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
it's

480
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
a very large pdf that's online

481
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
and what you can do is

482
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
either leverage it to do

483
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
an entire insider threat vulnerability

484
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
assessment or if there's an insider

485
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
threat program

486
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
in place an insider threat program

487
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,559
assessment but in this case

488
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,799
i'm conducting we're conducting right

489
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
now we're preparing for

490
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,280
a cyber security program assessment so

491
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
we're going to just take a few controls

492
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
out of here i guess there's

493
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
five highlighted

494
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
so we're going to get with hr and we're

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
going to ask them

496
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
if you become aware

497
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
of an employee that's very upset or

498
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
disgruntled

499
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
it may be because of some sort of

500
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,679
human resources action that's being

501
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,840
taken against them maybe somebody made

502
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,600
a complaint against them

503
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,400
um

504
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,919
or

505
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
they're having a very negative

506
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
performance review like does not meet

507
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,160
does not meet and they're upset it's

508
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,919
very clear hr has realized this do they

509
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,720
have a process to reach out to the cyber

510
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
security team and just say

511
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
for this employee or for this contractor

512
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,120
can we

513
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,159
have an

514
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
enhanced period of monitoring say a

515
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
month or two so not giving any real

516
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,559
details just saying

517
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
for this process we've established for

518
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,280
the next month or two would you

519
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
monitor this this employee

520
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
that's something good to check for

521
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
also and this is kind of reinforcing

522
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
what we talked about before

523
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
what is

524
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
that the baseline of normal behavior

525
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
from employees for systems so if you've

526
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,919
got two systems that talk to each other

527
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,600
for the first time

528
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
in a year maybe somebody should go take

529
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
a look at that

530
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,679
enforcing separation of duties and lease

531
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,440
privilege

532
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
so

533
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,559
one area i look for

534
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,799
is are

535
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,520
there um access control reviews that

536
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
take place when someone switches jobs so

537
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,919
if you've got someone moving around in

538
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,919
accounting for example

539
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,320
or are you making sure that

540
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,240
their legacy accesses are being

541
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
rescinded so that the right

542
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
separation of duties

543
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
remain in place and they don't have

544
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
privileged creep right so they retain

545
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
legacy accesses and they keep moving

546
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,520
through jobs that can break down

547
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
separation of duties

548
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
and

549
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
enable them to commit fraud so need to

550
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
be mindful and make sure some of those

551
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
processes are in place

552
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,919
close the doors to unauthorized data

553
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,320
exfiltration so as cyber security

554
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,200
professionals we focus on that a lot

555
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
it's something we need to be really good

556
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,280
at to understand

557
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
modern day

558
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,679
real time threat landscape

559
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,159
how our adversaries exfiltrating data or

560
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
removing exporting data from

561
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,360
environments during data breaches

562
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,080
and we also want to make sure that

563
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
again within our work papers we're

564
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
looking for a comprehensive employee

565
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
termination procedure so systematic

566
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,080
removal of accesses for everyone

567
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
as they leave the organization last day

568
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
we're going to rescind all their

569
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,679
accesses then if someone's being

570
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,159
terminated or fired

571
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
then we probably want to have better

572
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
coordination

573
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
and as they're being asked to come into

574
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,559
an office

575
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,360
um

576
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
to be informed of that we want to make

577
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,960
sure that

578
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
all of their accesses are rescinded you

579
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,039
know that

580
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,320
so i wanted to get started with um a

581
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,799
couple of of quotes in the presentation

582
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,440
so one is from the 911 commission report

583
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
so defenses also complicate the plans of

584
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
attackers increasing the risks of

585
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,039
discovery and failure so we want to have

586
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,080
layered

587
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,880
preventive and detective controls really

588
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
following where our sensitive data and

589
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
our assets are and that's why we're

590
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,120
still flushing out work papers

591
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
so we're going to pivot a little bit and

592
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,120
we're we're going to have an attack

593
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
centric focus

594
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
so you know that

595
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
when an adversary is trying to

596
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,760
um

597
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,039
get into an organization and exfiltrate

598
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
data commit a data breach

599
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,840
they start by sending a phishing message

600
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
and they're trying to get an end user to

601
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,440
click on a malicious link and or

602
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
an attachment with malware in it so

603
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,679
we're looking to make sure that the

604
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,320
organization has

605
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
a program

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
where

607
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
test messages or send phishing test

608
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
messages go to all the

609
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,880
end users on the network and

610
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,960
not only through awareness training but

611
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
through receiving these test messages

612
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
they're learning what does a true

613
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
phishing message look like how do i

614
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,520
report it to the cyber security team and

615
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
and hopefully along the way we're

616
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,039
getting to the point where they're not

617
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
going to click on a malicious link

618
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
or a file attachment from someone they

619
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,000
shouldn't

620
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
we also want to check and see if

621
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,480
email authentication been enabled on the

622
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,960
domain to protect recipients of our

623
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
email messages uh make it harder to

624
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,760
spoof them

625
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
eventually an adversary will gain

626
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
system access

627
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,559
they're targeting that

628
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,440
in order to gain access to the data so

629
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,200
we want to make that difficult um so

630
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,080
we're going to rescind workstation admin

631
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
access from end users hopefully they

632
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,000
never get it they don't need it and that

633
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
also makes it harder

634
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,960
for malware or ransomware to execute if

635
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,799
the person that's logged in doesn't have

636
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,880
administrative access

637
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,360
we're also looking for some type of

638
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
advanced endpoint protection

639
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,799
not

640
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,720
anti-virus

641
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,440
with

642
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
that relies on signatures we're looking

643
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,440
to ensure

644
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,400
that

645
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
microsoft powershell is locked down so

646
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
increasingly adversaries

647
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,000
are avoiding bringing their own

648
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
hacking tools

649
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
binaries software

650
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,559
into their target environment they're

651
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,480
looking to

652
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
avoid detection by using the software

653
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
that's there so i'm

654
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,919
i'm sure many of you know that

655
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,360
powershell

656
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,159
is

657
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,120
um

658
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,360
software that comes with microsoft

659
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
operating systems windows admins use it

660
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,720
so what we're looking for here as has

661
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,679
our organization that we're assessing

662
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,279
have they followed microsoft's

663
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,640
recommendations

664
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,520
to

665
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,960
uh install

666
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,640
security configurations within

667
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
powershell including

668
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,480
enhanced logging for suspicious activity

669
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
we're also looking to see if two-factor

670
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,600
authentication has been enabled for

671
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
servers

672
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
it just makes it much more difficult for

673
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,840
an adversary to hop from system to

674
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,360
system and speaking of that

675
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
we all know that when the adversary

676
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,200
first gets into

677
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
the network

678
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
they're most likely not going to land on

679
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,799
the system with the sensitive data

680
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,960
they're looking for so they're going to

681
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,679
pivot and move laterally east to west

682
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,600
across the network

683
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,440
so we want to make that difficult as

684
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
well

685
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
so we're going to use network

686
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
segmentation and we're looking for that

687
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
in our assessment and looking for that

688
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,840
within our work papers

689
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
so that

690
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
there's network isolation or network

691
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
segmentation

692
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,919
where our sensitive data is so

693
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,919
the organization has

694
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,000
research and development data so

695
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
intellectual property

696
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
payment card numbers whatever the

697
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,039
sensitive information is that should be

698
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,840
isolated on a network

699
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
and and also have something like a jump

700
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,559
box so in order

701
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,080
for a user to get into that

702
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
network and to gain access to that

703
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
sensitive information they have to

704
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
authenticate to the jump box typically

705
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,799
there's two-factor authentication there

706
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,520
too just another layer of controls to

707
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
make it more difficult you don't want

708
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
everyone on the network

709
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
having a flat common use network you

710
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,919
want any end user on the network to have

711
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,880
access

712
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,399
to the systems that have sensitive data

713
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,039
also we're looking

714
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
we realize at some point an adversary

715
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,679
may get access to a system with

716
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,320
sensitive data this can be

717
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
an authorized insider

718
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
thinking in terms of insider threat

719
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
so we want to make it difficult to

720
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,399
exfiltrate data so how can we do that

721
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,159
well we can have

722
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,840
firewall rules

723
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,919
with granular source and and destination

724
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
entries in there

725
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
we can also look to resolve from

726
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,960
internal dns servers so that we don't

727
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,240
have

728
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
systems with sensitive data that have

729
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,039
something like port 53 going straight

730
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
out to the internet which an adversary

731
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,880
could use

732
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
to exfiltrate data so i think all of you

733
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
on the line right now realize that we

734
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,840
could have a whole presentation or maybe

735
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,960
three or four hours talking about

736
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
how adversaries ex-filtrate data and

737
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,679
what controls should be in place

738
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,760
fortunately we don't have that time but

739
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,840
it is good to do some research and

740
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,640
include

741
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,679
different tests and questions

742
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
within your work papers to look for the

743
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,480
necessary controls

744
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
we're also going to want to detect if an

745
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,960
adversary is in our network we're

746
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
looking for suspicious activity so we

747
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,279
covered a little bit of this earlier

748
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,880
we're going to centralize

749
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
logs uh to the sim

750
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,919
um you may also look to see if your

751
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
organization is familiar with a miter

752
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,159
attack framework and and how adversaries

753
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,320
operate and their tactics and that can

754
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
be used

755
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
to design some additional controls

756
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,399
within the network in the systems

757
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,440
also

758
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
we are from time to time going to have

759
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
incidents and we want to be very good at

760
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,600
incident response

761
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
to prevent an incident from becoming a

762
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,399
data breach so we need an incident

763
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,919
response plan

764
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,640
with scenarios and then we need to at

765
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,399
least once a year

766
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
conduct incident response exercises not

767
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
just with it

768
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,120
with lines of business senior leadership

769
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
we need to be looking for all of this

770
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,960
within our work papers

771
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,000
also our work papers need to be current

772
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
and i've kind of hit on this a little

773
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,360
bit before now so it's good to be uh

774
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,799
attending

775
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,399
um

776
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
different webinars

777
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,799
such as the the serious uh security

778
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
seminar series that that we're

779
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
participating in now

780
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
um also

781
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,200
organizations like infragard uh they

782
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,480
have good

783
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,559
um security webinars and what you're

784
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,399
looking for is

785
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,600
coverage of a recent data breach

786
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
how did how did that occur what were the

787
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
what were the tactics that the

788
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,559
adversaries used and then i

789
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,600
stole this slide from a dhs presentation

790
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,760
it's about a year old but

791
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,000
these were

792
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,360
recommendations that could have helped

793
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
prevent the data breach

794
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,880
that was presented so don't white list

795
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
network traffic with trusted partners so

796
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,640
we already talked about

797
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
firewall rules with

798
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,520
granular source and destination uh

799
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,840
important protocol network segmentation

800
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,640
so it but it's good to see what has

801
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
happened recently

802
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,880
with a threat actor and a successful

803
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
data breach and what is being

804
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,080
recommended to prevent that same

805
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,159
type of data breach those same type of

806
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,640
techniques from being successful in our

807
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,120
organization so good to watch out for

808
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
these webinars to attend them

809
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,840
and add those controls into your

810
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,799
assessment methodology

811
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,200
need to also be mindful of physical

812
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,799
security right so

813
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
um i will when i conduct an assessment

814
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,960
asked to review the id access card

815
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,519
system and yes in

816
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,760
assessments that i've done i've seen

817
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,640
ork and minion badges and the orc badge

818
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,600
believe it or not had full access to

819
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
everything

820
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
in the building and and that campus

821
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
so you can imagine um

822
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,640
the orc isn't really affiliated with any

823
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,360
person and if this badge was lost it

824
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
could be used to get in anywhere and we

825
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,840
wouldn't really be able to track it

826
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,360
so obviously that was a high risk

827
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,120
finding that was

828
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
documented in the assessment but we need

829
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
to look for this so

830
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
scan through see if you can find some

831
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,440
fictional characters and then

832
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,360
follow along the path there and see what

833
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,919
kind of accesses those illegitimate

834
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,919
cards have but you also want to see

835
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,799
which cards have access to

836
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,120
areas where sensitive data is present

837
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,559
computer rooms

838
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,279
all access to the building or the campus

839
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,360
and ideally we're looking for

840
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,519
groups and role-based access in the

841
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,720
physical security id access cards just

842
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,919
like we do with networks and systems and

843
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,159
applications we're also looking for a

844
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,519
process where

845
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,720
someone separate from operations

846
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,240
at least annually is reviewing a list of

847
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,159
the employees and the contractors and

848
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,039
comparing them to the active access

849
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,240
badges

850
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
and this helps catch if someone

851
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
resigns or is terminated from the

852
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,120
organization and somehow the process

853
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,559
broke down and

854
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,679
their

855
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
access card privileges were not

856
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,639
rescinded

857
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
we do need to be mindful too again in

858
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
physical security

859
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,600
still within our work papers

860
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960
are the right controls in place to

861
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,799
prevent use of physical breaching tools

862
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,200
so the tool on the top the c-ramp tool

863
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
the way that that is used is

864
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,080
oftentimes you'll see computer room

865
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,279
doors have a metal plate to prevent

866
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,200
someone from using a screwdriver or

867
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,559
credit card to just slide the bolts back

868
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,279
well the c-rat tool

869
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
essentially you unfold it and it's

870
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,799
almost like a jackknife but you have a

871
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,799
very long metal um almost like a ruler

872
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,039
and you can just get around that plate

873
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,760
slide it up and open the door

874
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,559
so

875
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,640
you're not looking to use any of these

876
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,880
tools because you could damage

877
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,760
the doors um within the organization

878
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,559
you're assessing but you're looking um

879
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,159
could i use a c-rant tool here or

880
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,000
are there barriers

881
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,399
uh that have been put in place

882
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,960
on top and and and the bottom

883
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
of where that

884
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,760
that bolt is so that you couldn't really

885
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,639
be successful using a c-wrap tool and

886
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,239
also you're looking

887
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,159
on your high-security doors like the

888
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
door-to-wood computer room to make sure

889
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,719
that the hinges don't face out if they

890
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,440
do

891
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,040
can use the tool at the bottom there

892
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
it's about five dollars on amazon

893
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
to pop the hinge pins and just pull the

894
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,399
door out it takes about maybe 10 or 20

895
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,520
seconds

896
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,480
and there are to defeat that tool there

897
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,839
are screws

898
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,079
that you can buy also off of amazon that

899
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,520
kind of back into the the hinge

900
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,079
and they defeat uh that vulnerability

901
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
and that bottom tool there

902
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,599
as you recall at the beginning of the

903
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,440
presentation we had

904
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
this 60-minute scoping call with the it

905
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,119
leaders

906
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,920
with

907
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,640
the business leaders and we learned from

908
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
that right what is your nightmare

909
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,200
scenario things like that so

910
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,640
we want to

911
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
continue to flesh out our work papers

912
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,960
right based on what we learned from them

913
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,400
so are there large sums of money present

914
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
are their fraud prevention controls in

915
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,000
place um is there sensitive data present

916
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
uh is are there additional layers of

917
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
controls around that internally

918
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,520
two-factor authentication to access the

919
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,320
research and development systems

920
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,800
are there administrative or super user

921
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,920
accounts

922
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
associated with this data we should know

923
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,680
about

924
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
is the sensitive data

925
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,720
on its own network segment so

926
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,119
definitely important to really take what

927
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,920
we learned from the scoping call and

928
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,440
bake that into our assessment

929
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,760
we do want to cover some bad practices

930
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
too right not just the controls that we

931
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,560
want to see in place but the controls or

932
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,320
the vulnerabilities

933
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,119
that

934
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
shouldn't be in place are so are there

935
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,280
any shared accounts in use and we may

936
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
want to cover that with you know several

937
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,160
roles as we go

938
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,760
um

939
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
do developers have access to production

940
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,119
data they probably shouldn't right um

941
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,359
are there any any firewall rules in

942
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,560
place so

943
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
we talked about having granular source

944
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,720
and destination and important protocol

945
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,839
rules if you have an any any rule that

946
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,880
allows

947
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,280
any source or destination any important

948
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
protocol we want to look for that and

949
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
maybe

950
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
have somebody walk us through the

951
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,040
firewall rule base

952
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,359
i do sometimes ask survey questions so

953
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,960
at the end of each assessment interview

954
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
um i will have already talked with the

955
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,680
cso or whoever the security leader is

956
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,480
said are there any vulnerabilities or

957
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,320
controls you're having trouble getting

958
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,839
in place

959
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,680
with your senior execs with your board

960
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,320
of directors sometimes you have

961
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,280
challenges rescinding access to things

962
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,839
like gmail the personal email so what

963
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,079
i'll do is i will go through and i'll

964
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,800
talk to the 20 or 30 people that i'm

965
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
interviewing as we're going through the

966
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
assessment and i'll ask them questions

967
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
like that do you need these accesses for

968
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
your job and then not only am i writing

969
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
up findings for for data leak

970
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,240
vulnerabilities here but i'm also saying

971
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
oh and by the way i spoke to the 20 or

972
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,680
30 people

973
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,520
listed further up in the report and they

974
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,240
all said they didn't need these accesses

975
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
so hopefully we can help influence

976
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,880
getting that rescinded

977
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
i will also ask

978
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,160
are there any security or risk concerns

979
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,720
uh that should be raised so um that's

980
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,640
kind of like the nightmare scenario

981
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,920
question

982
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
in scoping i'm asking each person

983
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,079
i've covered a lot of specific things

984
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,160
are there any security or risk concerns

985
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
that ethically

986
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,359
we should put in this report that i

987
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
haven't specifically asked about and

988
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,599
you'll get good results there

989
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,359
i will

990
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,599
ask questions and confirm

991
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
controls across roles and so should you

992
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
so some examples is

993
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,720
documentation of where the sensitive

994
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
data resides

995
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
business continuity planning you want to

996
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,599
make sure it's not just in one or two

997
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,760
business units it's in all of the

998
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
business units that

999
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,119
have critical processes or services

1000
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,119
system hardening across the different

1001
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,440
technologies just not one or two of them

1002
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,800
also access control across functions so

1003
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
we're trying to comprehensively cover

1004
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,160
these controls

1005
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,079
not just in one place

1006
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,640
finishing touches on these work papers

1007
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
we're going to sort by job function you

1008
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
remember that from the

1009
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
work paper screen that we were on so

1010
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
you may sort for example by the backup

1011
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
administrator and you only have a few

1012
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,200
controls you're checking and like wow

1013
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
even if i'm going to spend a half hour

1014
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,200
that we don't have many controls here

1015
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,640
and you know what i'm noticing now that

1016
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,079
i've filtered it this way that here's

1017
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,680
four or five other controls that we

1018
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,200
should be checking with the backup

1019
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,839
administrator would be an example

1020
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,640
you also are going to be speaking with

1021
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
people so you might reorder some of the

1022
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
controls a little bit just for a better

1023
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,599
conversation you may also notice you

1024
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,000
know what uh now that i think of it i

1025
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,079
should probably add this control to a

1026
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,160
couple of other job functions and you'll

1027
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,000
copy that across

1028
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,839
remember from the beginning of our

1029
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,359
conversation

1030
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,440
we need to make sure we're following

1031
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,079
the three assessment techniques so

1032
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
interviewing staff or asking questions

1033
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,599
where we must right but as much as we

1034
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
can we want to observe whether the

1035
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,680
control's in place so we're doing a

1036
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
factual assessment

1037
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
and we want to review documents policies

1038
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,960
standards

1039
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,240
screenshots artifacts

1040
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,599
at this point

1041
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,839
we're going to ask whoever's helping us

1042
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,800
schedule the assessment interviews

1043
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,440
um to set those meetings up so we're

1044
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
going to know

1045
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
we're going to do this assessment over

1046
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
the following couple of weeks

1047
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
and we now know from our work papers

1048
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,920
which titles or roles of people that we

1049
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,560
need time with and if you filter your

1050
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
work papers you're going to see whether

1051
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,440
you need 30 minutes 60 minutes probably

1052
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,359
going to need longer than that for the

1053
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,680
physical security tour something like

1054
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,839
120 minutes

1055
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,040
you're also going to want to have an

1056
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
assessment status call at the end of

1057
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
each week if maybe one of the people

1058
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,920
called out sick we've got to reschedule

1059
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
that interview

1060
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
if we've been asking for artifacts and

1061
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
we're not getting them

1062
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,280
and you also do need to tell the person

1063
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,359
that's going to schedule the interviews

1064
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,200
we need to meet with the people that do

1065
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,240
the work

1066
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,079
people that know whether a control's in

1067
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,880
place or not i've had some times where a

1068
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
manager will say oh this is great i can

1069
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,839
cover you know four of these roles

1070
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,079
no we need to meet with the people that

1071
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,240
do the work so we want to meet with the

1072
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,400
sysadmin the dba

1073
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
and if the manager wants to come along

1074
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,440
and they want to listen in that's fine

1075
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
but we need to speak with the people

1076
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,440
that do the work

1077
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
i've talked about artifacts before so

1078
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,560
again fact-based assessment this is a

1079
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,160
very small portion of what i'll

1080
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
typically ask for aligned to the

1081
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,079
different controls so you're going to

1082
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,920
want to ask for

1083
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
artifacts up front and you may ask for

1084
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,680
some by discovery things that occur to

1085
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,000
you in the conversations

1086
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,359
as you go along in the assessment

1087
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,839
you should be spending as much time

1088
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,319
preparing for the assessment so scoping

1089
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,200
work papers as the time

1090
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
spent conducting the assessment over a

1091
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,359
couple of weeks

1092
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,280
and then also documenting the report

1093
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,760
presenting the results

1094
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,440
the assessment report is going to have

1095
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,920
an executive summary so typically about

1096
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,119
one page

1097
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,720
and

1098
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,520
we're telling the executives at a high

1099
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,640
level the trends that we saw

1100
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,839
on areas that could use improvement

1101
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,839
and then typically will

1102
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,000
detail findings which would be a

1103
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
violation in this case of in this cyber

1104
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,680
security framework or a policy or

1105
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,599
standard of the organization and

1106
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,119
recommendations

1107
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,319
may be other best practices or in some

1108
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,119
cases just good common sense

1109
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,200
i did want to mention that as an

1110
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
assessor you should be giving the

1111
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,720
assessment report to one person

1112
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,560
initially it'll be a draft and they'll

1113
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,960
get feedback you're looking to see if

1114
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
there's any significant issues something

1115
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,680
that's just blatantly wrong

1116
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,800
perhaps miscommunicated by someone

1117
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
and then you give that person the final

1118
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,319
report and they control distribution not

1119
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,880
us so if someone asks me hey gideon can

1120
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,040
i have a copy of that report also say

1121
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,560
sure you can get it from jane

1122
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,480
you may be asked to do a presentation to

1123
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,640
executives so you could steal some of my

1124
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
slides on thread actors assessment

1125
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,119
methodology in this csf you're going to

1126
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,040
want to do a findings overview that's

1127
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,599
really what the execs are interested in

1128
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,720
perhaps

1129
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
covering the high risk findings and then

1130
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
some of the

1131
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,240
higher risk moderate findings or

1132
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,480
doing an overview of some of the trends

1133
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,200
that you're seeing in residual risk

1134
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
swot analysis is great to conclude with

1135
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,000
strengths weaknesses opportunities and

1136
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
threats

1137
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,240
relatively straightforward remember that

1138
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
you're dealing with the c-suite or

1139
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,800
senior executives and they're focused on

1140
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
operational risks we want to talk more

1141
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
about operational risk

1142
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,040
than we do cyber security and they will

1143
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,520
be looking for remediation plans which

1144
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,000
is not us the assessor you want to kind

1145
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,800
of nudge the cyber security team

1146
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200
to be maybe put a slide or two in there

1147
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
or be ready to speak to that

1148
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,359
future assessment so he who tries to

1149
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,000
defend everything defends nothing

1150
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
i'm going to ask you to accept a little

1151
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,440
risk here

1152
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,880
as you do

1153
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,440
future assessments beyond the the cyber

1154
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,079
security program assessment we spoke to

1155
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,040
it's fine to start with

1156
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
existing work papers things like missed

1157
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,359
cyber security controls but you do want

1158
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,440
to focus on the function that you're

1159
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,480
covering

1160
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,640
like a security operations center or a

1161
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,880
line of business

1162
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,040
people will ask me well what would we

1163
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,520
focus on on a line of business

1164
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,800
how do they

1165
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,640
deal with access control so they have

1166
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,200
control over sharepoint sites

1167
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,760
file shares things like that

1168
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,359
access to

1169
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,920
sas applications that are provided by

1170
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
vendors how are they dealing with access

1171
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
control they have critical processes

1172
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
where sensitive data or assets are

1173
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
involved do they have processes

1174
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,040
documented are there controls in place

1175
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,599
for insider threat or fraud

1176
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,000
do they have a call center how are they

1177
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,960
authenticating callers as as they call

1178
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,359
in and ask for information or ask for

1179
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,640
access

1180
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,760
application governance so in addition to

1181
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,599
access control if they're dealing with a

1182
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,720
vendor

1183
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
are they dealing with the vendor shared

1184
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,640
security model for example if the vendor

1185
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,480
says you know you really should

1186
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,319
implement two-factor authentication

1187
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,079
here's how you do it

1188
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,200
um

1189
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,119
and we'll keep going

1190
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,280
there are other options for future

1191
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,400
assessments

1192
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,440
beyond

1193
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,599
a line of business i think

1194
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,680
there can be good return doing business

1195
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,920
process risk assessments

1196
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,400
um failure modes and effects analysis if

1197
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,560
you're not familiar with that that's

1198
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,760
um

1199
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,960
worth orienting yourself with

1200
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,760
there's a variety of assessments here

1201
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,359
that we could discuss

1202
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,319
so

1203
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,960
with that i am a cyber security

1204
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,000
but with your permission getting i'd

1220
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
like to start us off today so you i

1221
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,760
loved your overview um on how you uh

1222
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,079
conduct some of these assessments but

1223
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,400
and their every company is different but

1224
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,520
let's say

1225
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,960
sort of your average medium size or

1226
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,440
small business how many hours

1227
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,359
is needed to be invested to do a

1228
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,680
thorough assessment what is the typical

1229
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,599
time frame for you

1230
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,640
so so end to end and obviously this was

1231
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,680
very involved right so to orient

1232
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,160
yourself to the to the organization to

1233
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,800
go through and flesh out work papers to

1234
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,920
execute on the assessment to create the

1235
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
report which 90 of it is going to be

1236
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,280
unique content and to present that can

1237
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,359
be around 160 hours so it's it's a lot

1238
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,640
of work primarily in the prep and then

1239
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,400
there's a lot of work

1240
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,359
that goes into the report so yeah

1241
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,079
give or take something like 160 hours so

1242
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,480
it's it's a lot of work

1243
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,520
so of the various types of assessments

1244
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,920
do you tend to favor one or the other

1245
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,040
and and why

1246
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,480
so

1247
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,240
my whole career i've tried to be risk

1248
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,280
opportunistic right so i i would say if

1249
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,599
you're just starting out

1250
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,520
and you've got a good cyber security

1251
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,200
program in place but you really don't

1252
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,000
have

1253
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,319
many assessments or much assessment

1254
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,200
activity it's good to start

1255
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,640
with

1256
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
a cyber security program assessment

1257
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,960
which is really kind of covering

1258
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,440
um the core controls and the controls at

1259
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,000
the enterprise level

1260
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,720
so maybe you do that year one

1261
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,559
year or two

1262
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,319
perhaps you do

1263
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,400
an assessment of the cyber security

1264
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,040
controls with the one within one of the

1265
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,359
the riskier lines of business so for

1266
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,240
example a pharmaceutical company where

1267
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,359
where are the pipeline drug formulas

1268
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,880
um

1269
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
or maybe you do

1270
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,599
finance

1271
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,920
where there's large amounts of money and

1272
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,839
make sure they have the right

1273
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,319
processes and controls in place

1274
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,040
then probably the third

1275
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,520
year you might choose some critical

1276
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,000
business processes

1277
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,040
and

1278
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,839
work like that and then

1279
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
within the deck there's a litany of

1280
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,319
other areas like i didn't really speak

1281
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,680
much as i

1282
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,920
breezed by this the security operations

1283
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,880
center is really core

1284
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,200
to the cyber security program

1285
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
so it's not just where the logs are

1286
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,800
coming in and the sim is

1287
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,000
but

1288
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,599
it's where

1289
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,760
the sock analysts are and threat hunting

1290
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,079
is going on in incident response so

1291
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,000
there's a lot there

1292
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,800
so

1293
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,920
um this might be the fourth level

1294
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,040
um i hope i answered your question joel

1295
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,280
yeah yeah you did thank you

1296

1298
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,800
means those who may not be students

1299
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,119
knows that this is technically the end

1300
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,440
