uh weekly security seminars

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,760
and this week i'm really pleased to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,719

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,759
our speaker jack daniel

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,200
uh there's a lot of things that can be

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,039
said about jack

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
obviously one of them is he definitely

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,160
is one of the great beards of security

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
you can see that yourselves uh

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,640
jack has had an interesting path to get

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,519
to

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,238
security but one that has caused him to

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,520
really appreciate

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
when it works among other things he's

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
a uh an advocate and champion

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
of security and the community at tenable

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
and is really responsible i would say

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
for a lot of the growth of the b-sides

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,239
conference

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
he's well known as a mentor a speaker

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
and a curmudgeon

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
and i'll leave it at that and i'd like

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,000

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
you spaff uh you were instrumental in me

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,960
making this

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
uh project happen but let's let's

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
dig into it so the important part

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,840
i started out as an auto mechanic and

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
stumbled into

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
management and they made me take care of

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
computers

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,400
i haven't been at this is a security

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,119
focus

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,759
as long as a lot of people think and one

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
of the things that we love

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,600
about security is that it's a challenge

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,399
many of us

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
are drawn into security because of the

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
challenges

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
although often times we find ourselves

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,600
thinking

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,079
i wanted a challenge this is a little

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
bit more than a simple challenge

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but there we are so

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
let's go in a completely different

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
direction

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
if we think about popular music of the

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
past 100 120 years

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,400
it's pretty easy to find some threads

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
and pull on them and see some history

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
one of my favorites is surf guitar

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
you can go back a century and find

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
middle eastern

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
mediterranean folk music and then find

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
in the 50s 60s

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
up until a couple of years ago dick dale

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
mining that for

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
some incredible surf music based on

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
things like havana gila

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
and miserloo the movie pulp fiction

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
years decades now ago reignited the

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
interest in that stuff but that started

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
with folk music and somebody's saying

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
let's take folk music in a completely

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
new direction

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
you know we can uh look at the migration

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
of blues from the

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,720
mississippi delta up from acoustic blues

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,959
through chicago blues

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
into electronic blues and rock

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
and roll it's easy to follow that up

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,720
uh peer of dick dale's was link ray

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
somebody asked him to improvise a song

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
once in the 50s as he and his band were

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
changing from being country to

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
this newfangled rock and roll and in a

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
single song he

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,680
gave us the world's first power chord he

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
started doing some rudimentary shredding

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,720
in that song

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,959
at the end of it he twisted the vibrato

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,120
knob up on everything and got some weird

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,760
electronic

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
effects uh and paved away between dick

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
dale and link ray

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,440
for heavy metal for uh

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
rock and roll in general but heavy metal

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,480
in particular

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
you know a few years later the sonics

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,840
who aren't that well known there was

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
this song called uh

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,959
strychnine where singing the joys of uh

103
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,360
drinking poison for fun

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
that laid a path that went through

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
punk it went through grunge long before

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,519
grunge

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
uh you know the easy one to pick on is

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
the velvet underground right it

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,879
who knows how many bands were formed by

110
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,680
the

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
velvet underground initially they

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,360
weren't a commercial success

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
except with musicians who took it in

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
different directions

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
and you go back you know you come

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
forward another decade or so from there

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
i remember

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
in the late 70s a band or a group called

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
the sugar hill gang

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
gave us the song rapper's delight which

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,199
just

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,479
launched the the public acclaim

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
and altered the path that just paved a

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,880
path for rap

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
hip hop and it goes on and on

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
um you know it just it just keeps

127
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
going and we can go all right so the

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
disclaimer here wikipedia

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
is wikipedia but sometimes it's a good

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,919
starting place for things

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,520
uh google your you know you ask

132
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,759
wikipedia for your favorite band or

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
genre

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
um they're they're documentaries the

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
documentary about muscle shoals is

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
amazing

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
uh there's one on electric guitar called

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
it might get loud

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
bbc radio 4 did a documentary on the

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,120
song

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
summertime from its original porgy and

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,479
bess

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
incarnations through the decades to

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,919
being a brazilian jazz

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
standard to janus's you know ultimate

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
blues rock cover to being a civil rights

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,919
anthem of sorts

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
uh recently smokey robinson did a thing

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
for audible words and music

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
that was was amazing to see where he had

151
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
come from and the

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
things that he was adjacent to

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
so what's your point jack

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
do that with what we do tell us

155
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
who these people are what their stories

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
are

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
so there's a question that does come up

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
obviously you know

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
why why look back

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and as it says on the passenger side of

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,479
your car um

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
you know those those things in our past

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
really aren't that far

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
back there they're a lot closer than

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
uh you might think and a lot of people

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
reinvent things that have been done

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,360
many times before so let's take a look

168
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
at why we don't know them

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,758
things were different

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
information security information

171
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,840
assurance

172
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,800
cryptography were part of what you did

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
they weren't an industry unto themselves

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,639
really um

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
for a long time you just did it it was

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,039
part of the job

177
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,199
um an obvious one is we just can't keep

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,440
up

179
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
part of the drive to do this talk was me

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,599
recognizing that

181
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
how much how little i knew and how

182
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,360
important it was that uh some of us make

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
an effort

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
to help tell these stories

185
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
um especially while some of the

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
first-person accounts are available to

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
us

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
but when you enter this field you run to

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
keep up and

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
the opportunity to stop and look back is

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,039
rare

192
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
so i try to do this as a way to make it

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
easy to look back

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
and find some things and keep us

195
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,919
aware of where we came from a lot of the

196
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,919
foundational work uh

197
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,840
isn't on the internet um if if

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
if if a paper falls in a university and

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
google doesn't index it did it get

200
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,479
written

201
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
well the truth is it did but it makes it

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
hard for us to know what came before

203
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,360
um silos unfortunately we haven't

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,479
cured this one some of it is for

205
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
um valid reasons but there are a lot of

206
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
silos a lot of things happened

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,520
in the military a lot of things happen

208
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
in the civilian side of government a lot

209
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
of things that happen in academia

210
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,639
aren't always well known in industry

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,759
and vice versa

212
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
a lot of folks are no longer active

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,120
obviously some of these people have uh

214
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
passed along before us

215
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,560
many here uh have decided to retire

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,440
um but we don't get to see these people

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
there we go

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
uh for those of us like me who do a lot

219
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,680
of conference

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
stuff a lot of folks are not on the

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
conference circuit or at least not in

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
the conferences that we're on so it's

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
easy to

224
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
just not see them and if you don't see

225
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,159
them you don't think about them

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
so we'll start out with some names that

227
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
you know and let's talk about

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
um them as as actual

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,000
people though um

230
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
so everybody knows alan turing okay no

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
all right it was a pretty good movie a

232
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,200
few literary uh

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,080
license takes but uh alan turing i'm not

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
gonna dwell here that he's well known

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
but alan turing opens the door to having

236
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
conversations about people like

237
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,279
doc keane it was called doc because he

238
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
used the leather's doctor's bag for his

239
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
engineering tools

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
touring didn't come up with an

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
engineering

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
blueprint for creating the bomba he had

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
ideas he was brilliant

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
he knew what needed to be done but it

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
took this engineer

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
to translate that into

247
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
something that could actually be built

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,519
and then supervise the construction

249
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,040
and it took people nuts and bolts and

250
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
solder to make that actually happen

251
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
so not to take away from touring but it

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
took a lot of people to make that stuff

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
happen and some of them are

254
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
are forgotten the history of bletchley

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
park is full of overlooked people

256
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,920
um henrik zykowski

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,560
jersey riziki marion rajewski

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,959
this was a trio of

259
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,920
polish mathematicians and cryptologists

260
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
and they came up with this perforated

261
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,399
sheet called the zagalski sheet

262
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,640
before world war ii this was able to

263
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,519
uh speed breaking the original or the

264
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
earlier enigma ciphers

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,959
this required um

266
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,839
the upgrade to the enigma that required

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
the bomba to break that it required

268
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
touring and crew to to do what they did

269
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
these people are

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,800
unless you're a crypto nerd um or into

271
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,279
history

272
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,640
these are these are not people whose

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
stories are known but these people

274
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
did amazing things beforehand

275
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
sticking with world war ii um

276
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,720
julianna mikwits born julianne

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,839
charlotte ernestine von miquitz uh

278
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
that probably tells you there's an

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
interesting story right

280
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,399
talk about her a little bit because

281
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
she's not well known she was born in

282
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
1889

283
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
to finnish and russian parents tutored

284
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
at home in russian german

285
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,640
and english before she went to school

286
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
she and the family escaped from the

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
bolsheviks in 1919

288
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,839
uh went to poland uh joined the u.s

289
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
military attache office

290
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
escaped the nazis in 1939 eventually

291
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
arrived in the u.s

292
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
joined the army security agency the

293
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
precursor to the nsa

294
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
she is described on the nsa website as

295
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,760
being an innovative linguist who is

296
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
a prime advocate of new ways of

297
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
exploiting language materials

298
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
and developed highly invaluable

299
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
intelligence information at a time when

300
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,360
the u.s

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,600
lacked other sources so um

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
there's somebody that you wouldn't have

303
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
expected but there's uh

304
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
it took a lot of people to do what uh

305
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
what happened

306
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,880
we come forward this is one that um

307
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,519
is a story that i wish more people knew

308
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
being someone who hangs out in the

309
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
hacker crowd

310
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,720
as well as the more professional crowd

311
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
there's a lot of conversation about

312
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
ethical hacking

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
there's a lot of conversation about

314
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
hacktivism

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
and things like that if you don't know

316
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
his story um renee carmel was

317
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
a punch card expert he was

318
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
a worked in the french census bureau

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,560
before the

320
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
um before the war and

321
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,160
during the war after uh the germans

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
overran france and established the vichy

323
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,800
government

324
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,079
rene carmel um cooperated with the vichy

325
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,720
government

326
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,839
at least that was the initial appearance

327
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
he knew more about punch card systems

328
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
than almost anyone probably knew more

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,519
about

330
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
manipulating the systems than even the

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
people in ibm

332
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,519
through manipulation of the census

333
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,120
we can't know how many lives he saved

334
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,079
we know that he saved a lot of jewish

335
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
lives

336
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,279
undoubtedly saved some eastern european

337
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,920
slav

338
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,600
roma lives um

339
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,480
and he did it at a great personal risk

340
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
this one i am sorry to tell you doesn't

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
have a happy ending

342
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
this one ends with his capture

343
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
imprisonment and death at dachau

344
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,639
so um sometimes

345
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
people break things for valid reasons so

346
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
he's he's one of those heroes that i

347
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
wish more people knew about

348
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,639
uh let's move forward elizabeth friedman

349
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,680
so

350
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,160
i have to say i'm conflicted about uh

351
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,959
elizabeth

352
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,240
um she developed her

353
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
linguistic and uh code breaking skills

354
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
during prohibition

355
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
and as someone who likes to occasionally

356
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,440
enjoy a fine glass of rum or

357
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,079
uh whiskey this frustrates me but she

358
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,279
was doing what she was doing and

359
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
enforcing the law but the great thing

360
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,480
was that a lot of that

361
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
illegal liquor was coming in from the

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
caribbean central and latin america

363
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,079
when the war began

364
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,079
she was the best resource we had

365
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
she came from the coast guard and she

366
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
was transferred to the navy

367
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
and she knew how people communicated she

368
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
knew the networks and the communication

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
lines

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
she led to the u.s being able to

371
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,199
intercept and compromise the contents of

372
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,800
an enormous amount of

373
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
german correspondence that was coming

374
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
through latin america

375
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
it was incredible due to her earlier

376
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,399
work

377
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
friedman's team she built the team which

378
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
decoded at least 4 000

379
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,519
messages sent on over almost 50 radio

380
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,560
circuits

381
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
so she is another one who came from that

382
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,600
she and her husband

383
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
went on to do a lot more uh crypto nerd

384
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
stuff but she's one that we we don't

385
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
hear about too much

386
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
so let's talk about some better known

387
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,800
people uh diffie-hellman

388
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,920
right everybody knows whit and

389
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,839
marty new directions and cryptography

390
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,720
changed

391
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
the way we communicate on the internet

392
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
the idea of exchanging

393
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
keys securely in an insecure environment

394
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,959
was a

395
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600
was a stunning problem um the

396
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
diffie-hellman key exchange continues to

397
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,320
secure

398
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
our internet um was it sun forever

399
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
and his motivation was and you know he

400
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,680
cares about individual

401
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,240
rights and privacy thus the interest in

402
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,759
cryptography

403
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
marty is also interested in physical

404
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
security he continues

405
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
to talk about the dangers of nuclear war

406
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,279
he's been a

407
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
it was an early advocate of the beyond

408
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
war movement and to this day runs the

409
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,240
website nuclear risk.org

410
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
these are actual people with actual

411
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
passions they're not just names that you

412
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,199
have to

413
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,600
memorize to take a test now this is an

414
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,240
interesting picture though

415
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,800
because somebody's missing

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,800
um ralph merkel was a computer scientist

417
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,839
one of the co-inventors of public key

418
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,160
cryptography

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
the inventor of cryptographic hashing

420
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,160
he's later got interested in molecular

421
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,720
nanotechnology

422
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
and cryonics he is a foundational figure

423
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
that is often overlooked

424
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,639
but was a key part of that as you can

425
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
see from this uh

426
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
this dashing trio here

427
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,519
here's another one you know these names

428
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
they're not in order here but in case

429
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
you need a hint

430
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,599
they're in order here and uh

431
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,240
these are folks again it's not just an

432
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,959
acronym

433
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,559
it's not just a company ron rivest

434
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,839
invented several symmetric key

435
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
algorithms

436
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
uh authored md hashes

437
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,520
um interestingly long ago

438
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
he was concerned about this

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
integrity of voting can you imagine that

440
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,640
glad we solved that one huh um he

441
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
created something called the three

442
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
ballot voting system which doesn't rely

443
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
on cryptography because ron rivest says

444
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,600
i don't think we can trust crypto with

445
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
voting it's too important

446
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
our democracy is too important um it

447
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,960
allows for

448
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
anonymity but also uh verifying that

449
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
your vote has been counted

450
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
adi is one of the inventors of

451
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
differential cryptanalysis

452
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
um lynn besides his theoretical

453
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
computing science

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
and crypto has worked on uh

455
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
dna computing using biologics instead of

456
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
silicon

457
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,840
these are amazing people that

458
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
we're working on they're not just an

459
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,640
acronym they're not just that

460
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,880
but here's a question um

461
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,160
how about this guy james ellis

462
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,880
in 1970 so that would be before

463
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
rsa and diffie-hellman um

464
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
he was at gchq he was at gchq for a very

465
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
long time for those i assume most know

466
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,320
but that's

467
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
more or less the british version of nsa

468
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,320
um

469
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
and he had some thoughts and he put him

470
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
down on a paper internally and he called

471
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,280
the paper

472
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
um uh it was written about non-secret

473
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,640
encryption it was this idea

474
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,640
that you could um have encryption

475
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
in a non-encrypted space you could trust

476
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
things in public

477
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
um spaces

478
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,640
crazy idea a year later

479
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
two three years later couple years later

480
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
uh clifford cox

481
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,720
uh joined gchq brilliant mathematician

482
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
fresh out of university they weren't

483
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
sure what to do with them

484
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
one of the first things they did was say

485
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,880
here's

486
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
james ellis's paper what do you think of

487
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
this

488
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
well he came up with some stuff he

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
discovered some things and

490
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
created a few things

491
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
symmetric keys and some ways to do

492
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
things securely

493
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,600
and we now refer to everything

494
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
not everything we now refer to a lot of

495
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
what clifford cox

496
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
discovered and created after reading

497
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
ellis paper

498
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,760
as uh rsa

499
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
he went on to invent identity-based

500
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
cryptography

501
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
he i believe retired from gchq

502
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
he eventually held the title of chief

503
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
mathematician at gchq

504
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
which meant he probably could figure out

505
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
the tip at the pub without

506
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,280
a calculator a university mate of his

507
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
was malcolm williamson he joined

508
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,960
just after clifford cox

509
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
another brilliant mathematician uh

510
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
same thing what do we do with the new

511
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
guy yeah give him give him ellis's paper

512
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,000
in 1974 he thought about the challenge

513
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
of starting with an insecure environment

514
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
and came up with a way to securely

515
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
exchange cryptographic keys on an

516
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
untrusted network

517
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,400
a couple years later whit and marty

518
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
figured that out and it became and has

519
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
ever since been known as the

520
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,000
diffie-hellman key exchange

521
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,799
obligatory dog appearing in there so uh

522
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,679
none of this was declassified until 1997

523
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
and i really like to tell this story for

524
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
a couple of reasons

525
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,960
one um

526
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
there are a lot of really smart people

527
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
that pre-date us that have thought of a

528
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
lot of stuff that

529
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
we haven't thought of and maybe we

530
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,000
should think about it

531
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
but the flip side is what really matters

532
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
is what we do

533
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
with what we've done this stuff stayed

534
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
inside gchq and got

535
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,960
very little practical use at all ever

536
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,799
what the better known names did

537
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,679
was work out how to make it work and

538
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,080
change

539
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
the internet and the way we communicate

540
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,200
forever

541
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
so a little bit of humility but you know

542
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,120
what what you accomplish matters

543
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
a little humility um

544
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
tidbit james ellis passed away before

545
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
this was declassified

546
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
so it was one of those interesting

547
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
stories of

548
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
earlier construction but it couldn't be

549
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
shared

550
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,919
so let's let's now travel back in time

551
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,880
this is not

552
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,039
francois or louis blanc but it's a

553
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,880
french semaphore tower it's a recreation

554
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
of the symbol for tower

555
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
system that france used for

556
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,960
government only communications these

557
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
towers were all across france

558
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
back and forth up and down and they were

559
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,320
used

560
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
for government and military

561
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
communication only

562
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,120
uh francois and louis figured a way to

563
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,440
put

564
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,320
messages on

565
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
and get their messages across the

566
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
country and

567
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,880
it basically required bribing an

568
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,760
operator

569
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
to throw a message on and then

570
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
back off so there was a basically a typo

571
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,640
key you could

572
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
send a signal and then say disregard the

573
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
last letter

574
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
but what they would do is one would

575
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
place themselves at say a port city the

576
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,559
other one would be in paris at the banks

577
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,679
or exchanges get a message about the

578
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,240
state

579
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,039
of shipping about ships about battles

580
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
whatever they were trying to get

581
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
and they would game the stock market

582
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,919
they would game the systems

583
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,440
um and so they were subverting networks

584
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,280
uh and because these are clear these are

585
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
open in the air

586
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
you didn't have to necessarily

587
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
compromise both ends you just had to get

588
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,760
the

589
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
the message on the wire and then maybe a

590
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,080
pair of binoculars or telescope you

591
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
could see it yourself

592
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,039
or you could bribe somebody at each end

593
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,679
to subvert the network

594
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,400
they were arrested and this is for those

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
of you who have followed or

596
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
into the hacker history they were

597
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
arrested they got in a little trouble

598
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,240
but

599
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
then it turned out there were no actual

600
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
laws against what they did

601
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,480
they did choose to leave france wisely

602
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
but there were no laws against it so

603
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
they did not in their lives in prison

604
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
so our adversaries are have been with us

605
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
for a while

606
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
another one often seen as the first

607
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
modern hacker although i would say the

608
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
the blanc's probably ours is this

609
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,360
dashing gentleman

610
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
neville masklin

611
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,720
he was a victorian area english stage

612
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
magician

613
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
inventor of the pay toilet but he's here

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,679
because of

615
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
hacking marconi's allegedly a secure

616
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
wireless system

617
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
neville maskelin was

618
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,400
didn't believe marconi's claims of

619
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,200
security

620
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,039
and uh set up something marconi was in a

621
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,320
far-flung place and had his

622
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
an assistant of his in a parlor in

623
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
london with a group of investors and

624
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
interested parties

625
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
and marconi sent a wireless telegraph

626
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
message across the wire

627
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
masculine figured out how to do a

628
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
man-in-the-middle attack

629
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,600
and sent his message ahead of

630
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
marconi's the associate had read

631
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,600
most of an obscene limerick ridiculing

632
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,279
marconi

633
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,360
well before he realized what he was

634
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
doing for anyone who's done

635
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
morse code or other things you sort of

636
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,039
become a conduit and don't realize what

637
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,240
you're saying

638
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,720
and so unfortunately for marconi's

639
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,159
associate he read

640
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
an obscene limerick about his boss um

641
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
didn't go well so wireless man in the

642
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
middle attacks

643
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,200
in 1903 so some of these challenges

644
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,360
we've been working on for a while

645
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,120
uh here we go you expected this one

646
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
and you get homework i'm not going to

647
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,720
tell you anything

648
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
about grace hopper

649
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
which is amazing you got to know about

650
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,679
it here's your homework i'm going to

651
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
give you one piece of homework

652
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
you must have heard the stories if not

653
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
she was famous for giving people a

654
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
nanosecond it was how she explained why

655
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
it took so long for messages to get

656
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
to satellites and back to ships at sea

657
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
as an admiral

658
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,159
ask around figure out who you know

659
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,279
that has a nanosecond or had one because

660
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,559
they're pretty easy to lose

661
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,559
i've discovered i've never had one but

662
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
and ask how they got them and ask for

663
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
their stories

664
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
because the people that have these are

665
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
interesting people and the stories of

666
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,120
interacting with her interesting

667
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,279
there's if you want to see something

668
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,120
decades ago she was on the letterman

669
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
show and there's a great clip of her

670
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,320
the the internet has that um so that's

671
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
that so let's skip forward

672
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
here's one that i like to include in

673
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
these talks because

674
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,159
people know one thing about robert

675
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,159
tappen morris

676
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
people know that

677
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,360
um the morris worm

678
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,279
he was at school he created a worm it

679
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,760
blew up

680
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,320
uh and that's all a lot of people know

681
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,960
about him

682
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
so let's tell you a little bit more do

683
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
you know that

684
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
spaff did the forensic work on it how

685
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,399
did this do what it did

686
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,080
when he was just playing around you know

687
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,000
he had no malicious intent that didn't

688
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,080
keep it from doing

689
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
fun things on the internet but he didn't

690
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,679
have malicious intent

691
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,840
uh that proved that we needed some sort

692
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,799
of uh

693
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,520
computer emergency response thing like

694
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,200
say assert which came out of this

695
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
first person convicted under the

696
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,640
computer fraud and abuse act

697
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
he was charged in 89 sentenced to three

698
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,479
years probation in 90.

699
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
um but to me that's the boring part of

700
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,360
the story

701
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,320
he then went on to co-found two

702
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,919
companies

703
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,440
via web and the other one is y

704
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
combinator one of the companies he

705
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,000
co-founded continues to be an incubator

706
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
in the technology field all these years

707
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
later

708
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
the other thing that is not known about

709
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
him by many people is

710
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,520
that although he was not granted tenure

711
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
track at purdue he had to settle for mit

712
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,039
robert tappan morris has been a tenured

713
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,159
professor

714
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,919
of electrical engineering and computer

715
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,880
science at mit since 2006

716
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,120
so if all you know about him was the

717
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,919
worm

718
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,600
you should know that generations of

719
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
people that couldn't

720
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,720
get into sirius are doing pretty well

721
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,480
with him as their professor at mit

722
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
of course we can't talk about him

723
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,399
without mentioning his dad

724
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,679
um brilliant man was it

725
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
was at bell labs

726
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
for many many years worked on multics

727
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,960
and

728
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,720
later was involved in the development of

729
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,200
that newfangled eunuch stuff

730
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,399
uh he spent about a decade at nsa and he

731
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,640
was at nsa when

732
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,600
um his son got rolled up and the fbi

733
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,320
went in

734
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
to tell them that they were rolling his

735
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,919
kid up at school

736
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,159
and

737
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,000
the fbi normally comes in all fbi like

738
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,320
but

739
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
from folks that were there i've heard

740
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,039
that you don't go in fbi like

741
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,600
to fort meade so that was one thing he

742
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
also he's done some things there are a

743
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,480
variety of people

744
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,799
um one of the he's one of the people

745
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,480
that had this idea that we have phone

746
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
lines

747
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,640
wouldn't it be cool if we could send

748
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,760
data on a phone line by maybe modulating

749
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
and demodulating that

750
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
something that we got later abbreviated

751
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
to mo dem

752
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
he had three rules of um

753
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,360
cryptanalysis or he had a rule for

754
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
cryptanalysis three rules for computer

755
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,880
security

756
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,559
uh one of the things for anybody that's

757
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
ever done a capture of the flags

758
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,799
particularly with

759
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,720
with crypto challenges um

760
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,200
one of his famous quotes is never uh i

761
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
mean uh number one rule of cryptanalysis

762
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,440
check for plain text

763
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
if you've ever tried one of those

764
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
challenges and not look to read if you

765
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
can read the thing that's really

766
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,760
check for plain text

767
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
one of his things from bell end later at

768
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
nsa never underestimate the attention

769
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,559
risk money and time that an opponent

770
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,600
will put into reading traffic

771
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,440
he had three golden rules to ensure

772
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,039
computer security

773
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,679
for those who are as old as jaded as i

774
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,399
am i'm

775
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,760
you might agree with these uh one

776
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,279
do not own a computer two

777
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,480
should you fail there don't turn it on

778
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,279
three if you failed the first two please

779
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,559
don't use it

780
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,080
um so he was uh

781
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,320
he was that he was also famous for uh

782
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,399
chain smoking outside of his office and

783
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,720
uh burning up shrubberies at

784
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,799
the joint so let's uh come a little

785
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
forward did you know math and uh

786
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
security kind of

787
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,760
weave together uh dorothy denning

788
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,279
probably best known

789
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,519
for a lattice model of secure

790
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,960
information flow

791
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
which established a mathematical basis

792
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
for enforcing

793
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,559
information assurance information

794
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
security on a computer system

795
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,440
for those that are into hacker history

796
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
or part of that community

797
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
she was known for being originally quite

798
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
sympathetic

799
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,600
in her perspective on early hackers

800
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
later changed

801
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,159
her position on them she worked on the

802
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,080
skipjack block cipher

803
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,200
in defense of the clipper chip

804
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,039
i won't call her the nickname that she

805
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,760
earned but some people opposed that

806
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
she was at purdue for a while as a

807
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
professor then sri

808
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,760
uh then georgetown and eventually at the

809
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,080
naval postgraduate school

810
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,200
as was her husband um she's just

811
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
a brilliant character in our field so

812
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,480
now

813
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,360
we're going to

814
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,679
talk about a futurist i don't claim to

815
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,559
be a futurist

816
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,559
it's a lot easier to look back at what

817
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,200
other people

818
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,519
have done because that i can figure out

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,240
so there are people that we live with

820
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,120
today

821
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,799
if you said these things to them they

822
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
wouldn't believe you

823
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
the computer will touch men everywhere

824
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,480
and in every way almost on a minute to

825
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
minute basis

826
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
everyone will communicate through a

827
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
computer whatever he does

828
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,360
it will force and force change reshape

829
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
life modify career

830
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,199
accept the life of continuous change

831
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,120
in 1966 willis ware warned us of this

832
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,399
um it was quite a prediction he uh

833
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,640
his career started out uh working on

834
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
classified radar systems during world

835
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
war ii

836
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,799
worked on um iff identify friend foe

837
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,679
radar electronic systems in world war ii

838
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,320
he spent

839
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,200
40 years at rand from 52 to 92

840
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,080
he is the lead author of

841
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
it's got a boring title but he's a lead

842
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
author of what most of us know is the

843
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,960
where report

844
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,080
initially issued in 1967 i think the

845
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,720
final

846
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,960
iteration was 71

847
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,600
obviously it's completely obsolete

848
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
except that if you read that paper

849
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,919
you change a few words you change some

850
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,399
labels on a picture or two

851
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
and abstract it back to a higher level

852
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
it's

853
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,679
still highly valuable and very prescient

854
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,679
one of the important things that willis

855
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,799
ware understood

856
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,760
understanding all of these things was he

857
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
was concerned about the reliance on

858
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
computers

859
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
and that that would pose um

860
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,039
serious privacy issues he led a bunch of

861
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,159
committees

862
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,399
aimed at safeguarding computer user

863
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,440
privacy rights

864
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
um led the commission that was set up by

865
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,040
president ford

866
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,839
led to the first uh privacy act back in

867
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,000
1974

868
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
i wish we had voices like his that

869
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
people listen to instead of the

870
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,159
government doing what they do but that's

871
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,918
enough of me being political

872
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,079
uh just amazing if you i assume most uh

873
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,280
but if you have not read the where

874
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,320
report

875
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,399
um grab it it's easy to find on the

876
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
internet read through it abstract

877
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,040
yourself

878
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,239
back just a little bit and think wow

879
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,000
uh that's some fundamental stuff

880
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,119
speaking of fundamental things

881
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,760
bob abbott

882
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,200
did a whole bunch of stuff bob led

883
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,919
the first

884
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,400
red team um at nsa he created and led

885
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,040
the first

886
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,480
team at nsa to look at internal security

887
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
by poking at it

888
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,160
by today's standards it wasn't as

889
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
aggressive a red team as we've got now

890
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,720
but it was

891
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,280
it was where that started it was poking

892
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,680
at things at nsa to secure our stuff

893
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,640
before others violated it

894
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,079
he led a project called the research

895
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,920
into secure operating systems

896
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,640
the study ran early to mid 70s

897
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,040
[Music]

898
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
the guy the goal was to aid in

899
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
understanding security issues and

900
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
operating systems

901
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,599
and try to figure out what it would take

902
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,079
to enhance them this report hasn't aged

903
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,720
as well

904
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,040
unless you're into the history of it

905
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
however

906
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,280
there are some um there are some good

907
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,800
tidbits to be learned if you're really

908
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
into this stuff

909
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
one of the interesting things that came

910
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,839
out of the rice report was they

911
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,040
determined seven key things that were

912
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
real problems in operating system

913
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,560
security and the first two are

914
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
incomplete and

915
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,079
inconsistent parameter validation

916
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,000
implicit sharing of privileges and

917
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,320
confidential data

918
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
asynchronous validation and inadequate

919
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
serialization so yeah

920
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,839
race conditions in time of use time you

921
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,240
know time of checkout versus time of use

922
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
we were worried about these he was

923
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
telling us to worry about them in the

924
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,440
early 70s

925
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,480
one that we still maybe have some ground

926
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
to cover before we solve

927
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
inadequate identification authentication

928
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
authorization

929
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,720
um exploitable logic errors viable

930
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880
project prohibitions and limits

931
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
and yes it's a lot easier to define a

932
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,640
problem than it is to fix it but the

933
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,720
first step is defining them

934
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,960
and it's easy to read to see these and

935
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
get disgusted but honestly we've

936
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,520
the industry has made progress in the os

937
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,800
level

938
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
operating systems are imperfect but they

939
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,400
have gotten better

940
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
unfortunately the commoditization of

941
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,960
hardware and software and

942
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,760
commoditization of software creation has

943
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,800
allowed us to push

944
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,440
all of these and many more up into the

945
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
application layer and that's what

946
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,359
that's the challenge that most of us

947
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,880
face now

948
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
he was the author of the first set of

949
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
data and privacy confidentiality

950
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
policies for healthcare developed the

951
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
first multi-user multitasking os for

952
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,320
crate class

953
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
supercomputers that ran uh 24x7

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,079
uh he led a project that produced the

955
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,040
first uh

956
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,760
monitoring systems for open-heart

957
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,839
surgery

958
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,560
patients and one of my favorites

959
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,880
is i mentioned that team at nsa the red

960
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,119
team

961
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,640
the movie sneakers was

962
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
he was an advisor to the movie the core

963
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,000
team and that was

964
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,440
based on bob's team at nsa um

965
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,760
the james earl jones character was named

966
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,119
bernard abbott

967
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,240
as a nod to bob and so uh bob

968
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
uh was that also arguable he

969
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,960
was arguably the first person to leave

970
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,079
those sort of big brand bell labs

971
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,200
government jobs

972
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,440
and do information assurance information

973
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,000
security what we now call cyber security

974
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,359
as a consultant arguably the founder of

975
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,520
the industry that many of us

976
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:32,400
live and breathe in

977
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
another one fernando corby corbato

978
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
we uh we recently uh lost him but

979
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,680
he's interesting because he's the guy

980
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,119
that came up with the idea of using a

981
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,599
password for security

982
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,920
um

983
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,599
and more interesting was he knew that we

984
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,320
had outgrown the use of passwords

985
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,720
um

986
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,440
he um

987
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
that's an important thing sometimes

988
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
we're protective of our babies

989
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,839
uh if you have a great idea and

990
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,359
technology marches past

991
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
time march has passed let it go

992
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
and you thought it was better than

993
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
post-its although

994
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,640
um there weren't post-its back then

995
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,480
from mits uh it is tributed to mit's

996
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
csail site

997
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
it's no overstatement to say corby's

998
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
work on time sharing fundamentally

999
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,119
transformed computers as we know them

1000
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:33,920
today

1001
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,000
from pcs to smartphones the digital

1002
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,480
revolution can directly trace its roots

1003
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
back to the work he led at that other

1004
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,920
school uh mit 60 years ago

1005
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,320
um another one that's not as well known

1006
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,040
and it's

1007
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,720
it's not just to throw stones at kevin

1008
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
even though

1009
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,920
tsutsumo uh shimomura best known for

1010
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,760
helping take down kevin mitnick

1011
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
studied under feynman at caltech worked

1012
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,000
at los alamos than ucsd

1013
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,560
then nsa and son testified before

1014
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,359
congress on cell phone privacy issues

1015
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,280
in 1992. um the

1016
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,680
tracking and take down in 95 he's

1017
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
founded companies

1018
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,079
uh labs um his

1019
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,480
father got a you know tangent but his

1020
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,200
father

1021
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,319
earned a nobel in chemistry in 2008

1022
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,599
so an interesting family to say the

1023
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,280
least

1024
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,839
loving the commentary here so a

1025
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,040
sentimental favorite

1026
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
um not enough people know her those that

1027
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,480
do um

1028
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,640
i apologize hopefully of a handkerchief

1029
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
or kleenex or handy

1030
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,598
uh becky bass info mom

1031
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,280
i gave a talk about her

1032
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,760
and kelly you're out there somewhere and

1033
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
referred to her as the nickname that she

1034
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
got decades ago denmother of intrusion

1035
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,160
detection

1036
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,040
she ratted me out to becky becky made it

1037
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
very clear that i was no longer allowed

1038
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
to call her the den mother of intrusion

1039
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,599
detection

1040
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,319
she wished to be called the cranky broad

1041
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,880
and i continue to honor that to this day

1042
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,040
even though we lost her a couple years

1043
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,480
ago

1044
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
if you think about the names that we

1045
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,760
know in

1046
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
early network analysis intrusion

1047
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,380
detection

1048
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,469
[Music]

1049
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,200
my friend and former employer ron goula

1050
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,560
marty rash

1051
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,359
marcus that the number of people that

1052
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
she took under her wing when she was at

1053
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
nsa

1054
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
and helped advance the people she

1055
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,720
connected and found ways to advance

1056
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,920
the network analysis

1057
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,200
was just incredible and then after nsa

1058
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,480
she went into consulting and did some

1059
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
amazing things

1060
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,400
she grew up in south alabama

1061
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,359
as she told it when she went north to

1062
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,720
marry a yankee

1063
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,200
her dad made her promise that when she

1064
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
was done with all that nonsense she'd

1065
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,240
come home

1066
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,960
and she did she ended her career

1067
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,560
teaching at the university of south

1068
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,079
alabama

1069
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,680
fulfilling a promise that she made to

1070
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,160
her father uh when she left alabama

1071
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,520
when she was much younger so um also

1072
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,560
you know yep voices cranking amazing

1073
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,200
hugs

1074
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,040
so let's move on before i get really

1075
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,599
weepy uh she was just incredible and the

1076
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,119
number of lives she touched is

1077
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,680
incredible

1078
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,680
so um we're closing in on a point where

1079
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
it's time for questions but this

1080
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,160
project came about because

1081
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,119
i wanted to uh share some things and i

1082
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,240
started thinking about what to share

1083
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,800
and i thought about this i dug into that

1084
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
quote if i've seen further it's by

1085
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,200
standing on the shoulders of giants

1086
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,640
and newton who changed the way we view

1087
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,880
our world

1088
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,280
said that and he actually was

1089
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
paraphrasing one of his mentors

1090
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,760
this was uh not even an original

1091
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
statement which i think is really

1092
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
impressive that he

1093
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,599
took that um for a while this was

1094
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,480
actually on the

1095
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,640
rim of the british pound coin as i

1096
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,879
believe

1097
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,799
the important thing about this

1098
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,240
though is that it um

1099
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
its shoulders of infosec and the project

1100
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,960
shoulders intersect.it goes to an ugly

1101
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,920
wiki

1102
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,880
yes it's horrible no there's no padlock

1103
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,280
the

1104
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,839
like software stockholm syndrome i need

1105
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,359
to move it but anyway there are a lot of

1106
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,839
names there

1107
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,520
um but the project is called the

1108
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
shoulders of infosec

1109
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,920
not the giants of infosec

1110
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,119
newton talked about standing on the

1111
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,200
shoulders of giants but um

1112
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,119
giants is kind of a challenge uh we

1113
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,000
can't all be giants

1114
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,119
but we can all

1115
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,839
in ways large and small offer shoulder

1116
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,880
for others to stand

1117
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,040
on and um if you'll forgive a little bit

1118
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,800
of idealism

1119
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
i believe that by providing shoulders

1120
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,200
for others to stand on

1121
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,400
that's the way we become giants

1122
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,560
and so with that um

1123
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,240
before we throw it wide open and i have

1124
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,160
to find things a lot of people

1125
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,839
contributed to this project i mentioned

1126
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,880
many of them

1127
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,000
becky um marcus random ron goula gunner

1128

peterson

1129
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,200
spaff has been instrumental in

1130
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,520
pointing the resources and being a

1131
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,000
sounding board for many things

1132
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,480
and you know with that if you want to

1133

1135
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
i do a podcast everybody does a podcast

1136
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
don't pay any attention

1137
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,040
we don't have sponsors though at least

1138
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
i'm on twitter if your life

1139
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,920
is too shallow uh you can ping me at

work anytime i'm easy to find on that

1141
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,839
internet

1142
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
thing

1143
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,640
and with that i i realized years ago

1144
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,400
people say things like the end on

1145
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,960
presentations that's dumb my

1146
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,359
presentation is winding down

1147
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,560
but hopefully this has inspired you if

1148
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,880
you

1149
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
know of people or stories that should be

1150
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,720
part of this project

1151
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,920
let me know reach out join the wiki if

1152
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,119
you want to add some people yourself

1153
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,680
it's pretty simple

1154
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,720
learn share find out who you know uh

1155
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,920
that's got a nanosecond find out the

1156
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,480
story

1157
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,240
they may have just met her briefly at a

1158
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
conference they may have

1159
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,640
had good conversations um

1160
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
but then you know this is a beginning

1161
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
every end is a beginning

1162
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,800
and with that i will uh i will i will

1163
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,200
find

1164
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
glasses and try to read and see if there

1165
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,960
are comments or questions i should

1166
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,160
answer

1167
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,599
uh yes uh we

1168
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,800
we do all love and miss uh

1169
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,240
becky um and like i said

1170
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,640
one thing i would really like to um

1171
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,400
[Music]

1172
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,720
do is get more personal stories so if

1173
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
anybody wants to share stories in any

1174
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,119
way

1175
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,119
about any of the people that we've got

1176
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,440
on there anybody that's missing i'm

1177
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,119
teetering on the brink of trying to put

1178
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,560
the next generation in here

1179
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,400
in the wiki i'm struggling with the

1180
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
hacker crowd because that's probably

1181
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,160
better for

1182
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,400
people like jeff moss and people that

1183
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,319
are part of that culture to do that

1184
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,359
maybe someday when i no longer need to

1185
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,280
be employable or have friends

1186
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,760
i will write a book called how hackers

1187
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
ruined infosec and how infosec ruined

1188
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
hackers

1189
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,640
but that's a later project so i'm not

1190
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,400
sure about the how much hacker culture

1191
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,119
but there is a

1192
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,160
decided um inter

1193
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,400
um there's a decided interplay and

1194
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
a lot of us straddle that line between

1195
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,720
defcon and and black hat and rsa

1196
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
and so you know it's good when we break

1197
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,480
down barriers as i mentioned earlier

1198
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,160
there are a lot of silos in our world

1199
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,240
and any of those that we can knock out

1200
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,280
um

1201
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,800
there's um we're all better off for it

1202
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,760
and yes there's a

1203
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,000
mention the babbage institute has some

1204
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,680
great resources i link to those

1205
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,240
at the top of the shoulders wiki there

1206
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,079
are links to a variety of resources the

1207
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,599
multician's

1208
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,720
babbage there's some great papers at uc

1209
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,880
davis as i believe variety links

1210
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,200
anything that can be done uh it is a big

1211
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,119
ugly wiki and i'm sure the link rod is

1212
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,559
ugly because it's been a couple of years

1213
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,079
since i've crawled it but

1214
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,839
there's that um yeah

1215
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,920
so i really appreciate the opportunity

1216
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,680
to share this with you

1217
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,399
dig through here

1218
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,839
i'll uh volunteer jack

1219
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,319
i met admiral hopper but it was at a

1220
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,920
time when she was giving out picoseconds

1221
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,520
rather than nanoseconds so it gotten

1222
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,720
along to that point

1223
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,000
and unfortunately

1224
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,200
at some point in a move they disappeared

1225
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,520
i i have heard that i asked on twitter

1226
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,119
who had one to make sure i wasn't

1227
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,920
asking an impossible question and uh i i

1228
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,119
got the

1229
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,359
uh you know a small piece of wire is

1230
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,480
really easy to lose

1231
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,160
yeah um well the pico seconds were

1232
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,079
little packets of pepper she had gotten

1233
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,040
right from the navy

1234
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,640
and um so they were had u.s navy on them

1235
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,319
little packets of pepper and she said

1236
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,720
each was was a pico second

1237
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,400
and um they disappeared and i i often

1238
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,680
wonder if

1239
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,760
a roommate somewhere along the line

1240
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,880
decided that that was a condiment to use

1241
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,599
yeah that went on their burger or

1242
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,160
something yeah

1243
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
i would encourage the people who are

1244
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
listening who are interested in

1245
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
cyber security do to check out some of

1246
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,119
these resources

1247
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,599
that we do have a rich history as a

1248
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,559
field and as

1249
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,559
as jack said we're often too busy trying

1250
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,800
to keep up to really gain some of the

1251
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,400
perspective

1252
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,880
but when you look at some of the other

1253
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
sciences like chemistry or physics or

1254
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,079
mathematics

1255
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,240
there are a lot of interesting people we

1256
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,800
can point to

1257
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,079
we need to do a better job of

1258
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,079
understanding that in

1259
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,839
in cyber security

1260
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,598
so any questions for jack

1261
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,640
good i've loaded them all to sleep so uh

1262
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,240
yeah i think they're stunned or they're

1263
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,880
all checking out the wiki

1264
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,160
so there's a question what are you up to

1265
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,720
these days jack so i

1266
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,720
um i am at tenable i've been at tenable

1267
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,240
almost a decade

1268
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,960
ron brought me in i have a phenomenal

1269
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,599
job

1270
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,839
tenable is not a little engineering

1271
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:30,960
startup uh

1272
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,400
full of people that are out in the

1273
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,720
community but we know where we came from

1274
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,359
and

1275
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,359
i am the community advocate for tenable

1276
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,960
not the corporate community but the

1277
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
greater community and

1278
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,200
so working on the shoulders of infosec

1279
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,480
project supporting

1280
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,040
security b-sides globally and some

1281
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,800
specific events

1282
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,599
doing some uh work with stress and

1283
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,520
burnout and coping skills

1284
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,400
in our world which past years added to

1285
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,119
all of us

1286
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,920
a little bit of stuff on career studies

1287
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,880
and what makes jobs great and whatnot

1288
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
and uh just being out i always tell

1289
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,359
people what i do at tenable is

1290
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,760
i'm a little too candid for a publicly

1291
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,200
traded company to be an official

1292
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,319
spokesman

1293
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,920
so i don't really speak for the company

1294
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,280
but one of the things i always do is

1295
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,680
listen for the company and

1296
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,880
our ceo iran is a

1297
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,720
understands the value of connecting with

1298
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,000
community and so

1299
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,720
he and a few others there want me to do

1300
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,760
things like

1301
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,240
talk to people listen to people share

1302
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,200
what

1303
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,440
what i've discovered and put in some

1304
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,280
sweat equity and making conferences

1305
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,400
happen and building community

1306
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,079
jack there's a question in the q a

1307
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,760
which i can read to you or you can read

1308
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,839
it

1309
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,119
um no this is not obs i was going to try

1310
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,040
open broadcast studio but it gets really

1311
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,839
temperamental feeding obs to zoom

1312
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,119
this is actually a beta feature of zoom

1313
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,760
if you go into screen sharing advanced

1314
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,880
you can

1315
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,680
grab a powerpoint deck and use that as

1316
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,280
your virtual background

1317
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,720
and so that's what i've done here there

1318
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,280
is a green screen behind me

1319
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,720
there are banks of leds and other things

1320
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,079
because we all live here but that's uh

1321
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,200
that's one of the beta features of zoom

1322
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,400
is there they've made it easier

1323
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
obs does cool stuff but sometimes when

1324
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,000
you pipe it to something that it doesn't

1325
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,640
have a native integration with it

1326
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,400
it degrades the video quality pretty

1327
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,319
heavily and i think that's on zooms in

1328
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,440
they just don't know what to do with the

1329
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,599
virtual camera but anyway there's a

1330
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,160
zoom that if you are on zoom all the

1331
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,880
time

1332
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
they've made some advancements the they

1333
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,800
hide them

1334
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,640
uh but things like uh original audio

1335
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,839
which is what i'm using because i'm

1336
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,079
running through a solid mic and

1337
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,160
mixer and things like that they've made

1338
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,359
it better um

1339
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,040
so but you have to play first to get

1340
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,599
anything to work because technology

1341
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,200
all right well i don't see any other

1342
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,839
questions

1343
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,839
popping up um

1344
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,920
again i would encourage people to check

1345
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,680
out some of these resources

1346
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,880
for some of you uh i i

1347
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,559
typed in the link there of the babbage

1348
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,920
institute

1349
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,040
um they

1350
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,240
had a grant from nsf and they visited

1351
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,720
and interviewed a lot of these people

1352
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,480
about their backgrounds

1353
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,559
the one with willis ware was captured

1354
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,359
just about a year before he passed away

1355
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,640
and there's also one of becky um

1356
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,720
so there are a number of individuals who

1357
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,160
are interviewed there that

1358
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,160
you may never get a chance or will never

1359
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,839
get a chance to meet

1360
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,440
that you can hear some very interesting

1361
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,960
stories from them along the way

1362
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,559
but uh yeah there's a lot of history

1363
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,440
there that's worth worth following up on

1364
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,720
so jack thank you so much oops wait a

1365
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,240
second yep there we go

1366
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,920
thank you for an enjoyable hour jack um

1367
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,720
i i if any of you are at a conference at

1368
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,280
a con

1369
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,480
at a meeting and you see jack he may

1370
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,599
have a top hat on

1371
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,000
he sometimes wears a top hat which

1372
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,319
extends him to about seven feet tall

1373
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,640
but uh i'm sure he would be happy to uh

1374
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,800
to say hello if you were to if you were

1375
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,880
to meet him well one question popped up

1376
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,240
why don't you answer that and then we'll

1377
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,720
conclude

1378
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,400
so jack will system vulnerabilities live

1379
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,680
with us

1380
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,280
uh or do you think they're gonna end i

1381
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,720
think um

1382
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,799
i think we have some opportunities to

1383
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,960
improve

1384
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,240
things as whether we like it or not

1385
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,520
moving to cloud means that we

1386
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,079
have to work closer with developers so

1387
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,359
that we can

1388
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,200
work earlier in the pipeline to secure

1389
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
software better

1390
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
but we're never going to make

1391
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,599
vulnerabilities disappear

1392
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,040
and i don't say that because i work at a

1393
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,960
vulnerability management vendor um

1394
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
the built-in vulnerabilities are one

1395
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,590
class of vulnerabilities

1396
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,839
[Music]

1397
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,440
the making systems vulnerable by

1398
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,880
misconfiguration

1399
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,599
is is another class and it's really hard

1400
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,160
to make

1401
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,440
systems uh so

1402
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,319
that you can't uh that you can so that

1403
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,599
you can actually use them the way you

1404
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,160
want

1405
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,920
but can't screw them up and make them

1406
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,280
insecure

1407
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,920
um i think it was douglas adams that

1408
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,319
said

1409
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,480
uh anytime anyone who tries to make

1410
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,599
something idiot proof

1411
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,440
uh is underestimating the quality of

1412
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,119
idiots these days

1413
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,200
or something like that um and i don't

1414
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,160
like to

1415
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,319
call people idiots but you know the

1416
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,000
people are trying to do their jobs and

1417
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,200
if we don't make it

1418
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,000
really easy to do it the right way

1419
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,880
securely

1420
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,319
it won't be done securely

1421
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,240
thank you again jack and thank you

1422
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,640
everyone for being here we'll see you

1423
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:31,839
next week enjoy your afternoon

1424
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,440
you
