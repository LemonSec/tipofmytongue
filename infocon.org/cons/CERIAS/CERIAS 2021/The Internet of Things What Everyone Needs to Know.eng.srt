31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
pleasure guys um i wish of course that

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
we could do this

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
in person but i love the chance that we

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
get to do it it virtually and i

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,240
i look forward to what i'm sure is going

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
to be a great discussion what i have

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
queued up here for us is a little bit of

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,119
content as faf kindly mentioned from a

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
recent book

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,400
that i wrote on the internet of things

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
this is part of oxford press's what

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
everyone needs to know series

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
so it's very much meant for more of a

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,920
lay audience frankly

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
um and there's chapters there digging

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
into prevailing governance issues

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,240
security

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
privacy even looking at some analogies

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
including public health that we can talk

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,759
a little bit about

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,320
for for most of it my guess is for this

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
crowd it's very well trodden ground so

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
i'm going to go through some of that

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
material a little on the quicker side

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
i'd welcome any questions as we go or

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
any clarifications though of course

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,320
we'll have time

58
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
um at the end for discussion too but

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
anything i can clarify don't hesitate

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,799
for the second half i'm going to split

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
and do a little bit of a focus on a

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
recent report because i think that might

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
be even more useful and topical for us

64
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,319
this is coming from a report for the

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
executive council on cyber security that

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,280
the governor

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
organized here in indiana a couple years

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
ago it's called state of hoosier cyber

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
security 2020.

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
in just a couple minutes when we get to

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
that i'll go ahead and put up a link in

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
the chat box but if you did a search for

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
it of course it would come up as well

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
i think it's hosted on the attorney

75
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
general's site and the indiana business

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,959
research center's site

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
um uh correct me if i'm wrong about that

78
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
if anybody sees it

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
but i'll walk through a little bit about

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
that we did a survey that went out to

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
pretty much every level of government so

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
lots of local governments responded lots

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
of small utilities small businesses

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
and we found you know some interesting

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
results with regards to

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,519
cyber security best practices or lack

87
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,560
thereof frankly

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,760
um as well as uh uptake of new

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
trends like insurance and how that's

90
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
being utilized and understood and

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
sometimes misunderstood about

92
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
what it does and doesn't cover so we'll

93
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,599
talk a little bit about that too in case

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,440
that ends up any interesting discussion

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
or questions

96
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
um just a little bit of bookkeeping up

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
front um i am coming at this topic

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
even though i've tried to educate myself

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
more on the technical aspects of cyber

100
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
security over the years

101
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
i guilty as charged in a liberal arts

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,519
guy from way back

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
my i did a jd of course but my phd is

104
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
actually international relations

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
so a lot of my research is focused more

106
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
on comparative

107
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
cyber security law and policy critical

108
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,040
infrastructure protection you know iot

109
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
governance etc um so just know that

110
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
going into this discussion i would love

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
to win as i'm able

112
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
on any more technical questions but my

113
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
core kind of baileywick here is more law

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
policy governance issues

115
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
and this is the program that i chair at

116
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,040
iu that's built off of this and this is

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
a combination of our computer science

118
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
the letty's school as well as

119
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
uh business and law coming together to

120
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,959
offer this

121
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
the other thing i wanted to mention up

122
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
front is i have the the honor right now

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,239
of being the executive director

124
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,360
of the ostrom workshop um down at iu

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
and some of you might have heard of of

126
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,799
lynn ostrom and the ostrom workshop

127
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,080
perhaps some haven't

128
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
lynn is you know famous in some circles

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,439
at least for winning the nobel prize in

130
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,480
economics

131
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
back in 2009 and you know the the

132
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,358
workshop itself that she and her husband

133
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,680
vincent founded is almost 50 years old

134
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,238
now

135
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,000
and it's gone through lots of iterations

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
over the years their core

137
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
work was on addressing issues of commons

138
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
governance and how communities can

139
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
self-organize to address collective

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
action problems

141
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
whether that's related to natural

142
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
resource use such as a fishery

143
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
or toward the end of her career issues

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
of climate governance and climate change

145
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
these days i just wanted to mention that

146
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
we have several programs

147
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
running on data governance including

148
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
lots of work right now happening in

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
blockchain governance and ai governance

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
as well as a program that i head up on

151
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
cyber security and

152
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
internet governance and we've done a

153
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
variety of

154
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
research projects under this program

155
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
over the years

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
um a year ago the topic was the theme of

157
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
the year really was election security

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
right now in this current year we're

159
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
starting this new project on cyber peace

160
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
and we just had a cyber peace forum this

161
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
last week as part of a virtual davos

162
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,000
event

163
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
which is really interesting it's an

164
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
effort to bring together lots of efforts

165
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
around cyber norm building

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
i mean think you know about what's

167
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
really the goal here right what's the

168
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
best we can hope for in terms of peace

169
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,280
on the internet

170
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
and how through this multi-stakeholder

171
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
process learning from other analogies

172
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,199
even

173
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
including climate how can we get there

174
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
so it's an interesting discussion

175
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
um it's a timely time frankly to have it

176
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
with the incoming binary administration

177
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
now in power and some new

178
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
new interest on these types of

179
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
multilateral and multi-stakeholder

180
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
dialogue so

181
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
if anybody's interested in some of those

182
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
topics as well i just encourage you you

183
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
can there's a link on the top here but

184
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
just do a search for ostrom workshop

185
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
there's more than a dozen working groups

186
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
there's these active programs underway

187
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
and we'd love to have you um in the mix

188
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
a lot of cool speakers coming through

189
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
this last year actually we were able to

190
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
welcome bruce schneier ticket of our

191
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,840
memorial lecture on cyber security and

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
internet governance

193
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
okay and then lastly this is as i said

194
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
the internet of things book this is

195
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
where that's coming from some of this

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,280
content i also just last year wrote this

197
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
other book on governing new frontiers

198
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
and the information age this is a very

199
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
different frankly kind of book much more

200
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,479
of an academic tome so be warned frankly

201
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
but it looks at all of all these

202
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
different frontiers in the international

203
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,440
system

204
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
including classic global common spaces

205
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
tries to distill

206
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
frankly governance best practices that

207
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
have emerged across those arenas and

208
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
applies it to cyber

209
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
right that's kind of the crux of it in

210
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
the last chapter in particular so

211
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
it was an interesting exercise if

212
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
anybody is similarly kind of keen on

213
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
exploring some of those analogies

214
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
looking at lessons from other global

215
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,919
common spaces

216
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,520
you know what does cyber have to do with

217
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
space right or the atmosphere or even

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
antarctica et cetera happy to explore

219
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,280
some of those topics too because

220
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
it's a lot of fun and there's more

221
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
synergies than you might think

222
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,599
okay and as i said this is very well

223
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
trotted material so i'm going to skate

224
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
through some of these initial slides

225
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
here very quickly just to make sure we

226
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
have plenty of time

227
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
um for discussion and kind of the more

228
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
interesting stuff frankly toward the end

229
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,479
as spaf can attest um and as many of you

230
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
are very much aware too

231
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,800
cyber security is is by no means a new

232
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
issue

233
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
it's been around for decades at this

234
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
point right i'm thinking backspath in

235
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
particular to

236
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
you know even the morris form in the

237
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
late 80s right um

238
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
but you know what's interesting these

239
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,360
days is how

240
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
quickly cyber attacks have proliferated

241
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
um and number is sophistication and

242
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,639
severity

243
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,080
and the fact that they're targeting

244
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,599
companies and countries alike i mean

245
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,960
look at solar winds

246
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
um alone and all the different nuances

247
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
and and complexities to that particular

248
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
um exploit as it got into the wild and

249
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,800
all the damages caused

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
and we'll talk a little bit about that

251
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
at the end when we get to the insurance

252
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,039
context because that's already playing

253
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
out there in some interesting ways

254
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
um one of the big issues as many of you

255
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
know is we don't have a really

256
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
solid handle on the problem in part

257
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
because we don't have a really nice

258
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
authoritative data set to build from

259
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
which is a tough starting point for

260
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,120
policy makers

261
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
we have the starts of these of these

262
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,160
data sets

263
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
in terms of for example breaches being

264
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,440
reported to

265
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
state's attorney general we have that

266
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
here in indiana um in fact i've had

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
they're they're very forthcoming there

268
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
if anybody's interested you can actually

269
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,400
request and download

270
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
all the data breaches that have been

271
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
reported um here in indiana over the

272
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
last few years there's thousands of them

273
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,919
right

274
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,440
but it's only one piece of a very

275
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
complex puzzle which means that we have

276
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
to rely on you know secondary sources of

277
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,240
information

278
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
we have to take those with a grain of

279
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,519
salt of course as we do that

280
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,200
some interesting trends to keep track of

281
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
there uh especially internationally

282
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,679
with gdpr now in forests and a new

283
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
version it looks like now in the works

284
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
that could create some more authority

285
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
authoritative public data sets for these

286
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
types of exploits but so far

287
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
you know it's quite fractured so that's

288
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
a tough starting point

289
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
it's only getting more complex of course

290
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
because of this internet of things

291
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
concept

292
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
iot itself you know this is an idea

293
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
that's been around

294
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
similarly for quite some time um you

295
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
know there there's different

296
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
ideas about exactly you know where it

297
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
began um oftentimes we point to a

298
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
presentation by

299
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
kevin ashton in the late 90s and it was

300
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
more in reference to rfit dags at that

301
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,200
point

302
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
and how we can use technology to track

303
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,399
products um

304
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,920
but you know these days of course it has

305
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
a much more expansive meaning though

306
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
certainly there's no consensus on it

307
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
there's even this phrase out there the

308
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
internet of everything right is that

309
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
something that's even possible

310
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
um especially in an era which we can

311
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
talk more about from internet governance

312
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,920
perspectives where we're seeing

313
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
you know more and more efforts at data

314
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
localization

315
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
um banning tick tock right like india

316
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,480
did last year as well

317
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
so more of these walls going up making

318
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
making data governance harder

319
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
at a time when we need more information

320
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,279
sharing to get a better handle

321
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,800
on this cyber threat that we're all

322
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
facing in various ways

323
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
um iot itself of course has really taken

324
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,600
off

325
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
recently um in part because of a

326
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
convergence of several forces that have

327
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
been underway

328
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
um for decades really right of course

329
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,279
incredibly

330
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
um in a rapid uptake in the and and the

331
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
speed of broadband access itself that

332
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,839
that was really holding back some of

333
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
these technologies in the 80s and 90s

334
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
we're there at this point right

335
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
um the cost of course of connecting as

336
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
well is going down dramatically in terms

337
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,360
of the actual hardware

338
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
used just as a quick aside you know i

339
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
had the experience not too long ago

340
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
where we had to replace our washer and

341
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,600
dryer

342
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
and you know if it was pretty much the

343
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
case that you could not

344
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
find a washer and dryer that was not

345
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
connected to the internet that wasn't

346
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
rated you know at all highly on the

347
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
likes of consumer reports

348
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
so we've quickly entered into this world

349
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
of that especially for major appliances

350
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
but it's filtering down as you guys know

351
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
that really is the norm right that's the

352
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,959
norm in some really interesting and

353
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,000
profound ways and we've

354
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
seen that we've seen that play out in

355
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
terms of the security problems already

356
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
um often in class i like to show that

357
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,200
little clip

358
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,959
from andy greenberg you know breaking

359
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
into the the chrysler jeep

360
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
a couple years ago and how easy that was

361
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,000
in that

362
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
case uh for that uh for that to happen

363
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
and the aftermath of it

364
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
it's it's it's not a new problem again

365
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
but because we're at this scale a bit of

366
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
a tipping point of this hyper-connected

367
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
um society that we have to start

368
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
thinking long and hard about how in the

369
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
world we're going to manage all of the

370
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
security complexities the privacy

371
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,360
challenges

372
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
and what we can learn from other

373
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
contexts right and trying to get a

374
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
handle on this and so far

375
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
it's been very much on a jurisdiction by

376
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
jurisdiction basis which i'll turn to in

377
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,160
just a moment

378
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
which is also you know frankly

379
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
handicapping us to an extent

380
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
um this is just one example you know for

381
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
how this uh

382
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
how seemingly well-intentioned policies

383
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
can have some negative security impacts

384
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
and some of you might be familiar with

385
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
this as well this was a couple years ago

386
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,440
now

387
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
um when there was a defense department

388
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,519
policy to encourage the use

389
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,279
of soldiers to to have you know

390
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
basically fitbits to have fitness

391
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,760
monitors

392
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
and the thinking was oh this is going to

393
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,959
help with workforce readiness

394
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
we're gonna have a fit fighting force

395
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
this is this is great and

396
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
obviously lots of soldiers bought these

397
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
right this was fantastic

398
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
not thinking about well at the end of

399
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
the day these data

400
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
were being uploaded to a publicly

401
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
available cloud format

402
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
in shreva here and as a result anybody

403
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
could download the resulting heat maps

404
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
and you had you know what were supposed

405
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
to have been

406
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
you know uh quite secret military

407
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,639
installations around the world

408
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
uh being disclosed you know in some

409
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
cases uh

410
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
even for the first time really not a

411
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
great day uh for the for the pentagon

412
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
there were some problems even with some

413
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,279
navy vessels back then

414
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
so this just goes to show about the kind

415
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,720
of two-pronged approach here there's a

416
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
lot of benefits for iot

417
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
but we have to be mindful of what other

418
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
vulnerabilities we're opening up by

419
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
using it

420
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
especially in the workplace all of this

421
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
is getting more acute of course because

422
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
of the incredibly crowded playing field

423
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
as many of you can attest i mean just

424
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
look at solar winds there's a wide

425
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
variety of both

426
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,800
nation states as well as private firms

427
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,360
and

428
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
for that matter other organizations i'm

429
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
thinking of pretty advanced cyber crime

430
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,079
networks now

431
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,279
that are using a lot of the

432
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,120
vulnerabilities here to

433
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
launch attacks um whether that ours you

434
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
know whether that's more for espionage

435
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
you know as we saw with solar winds or

436
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,560
actual attacks like has played out in

437
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,360
ukraine

438
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
for the last five plus years now with

439
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
with regards to their you know for

440
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,040
example power grid being impacted

441
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
of course information warfare itself

442
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
being rapid

443
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
um in that context andy greenberg again

444
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,920
great book count

445
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
um that came out not too long ago

446
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
sanborn which i'd recommend if anybody

447
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,279
wanted to dig into that in a bit more

448
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,079
detail

449
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,079
but it's it's a tough time to think

450
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
about how to do deterrence more

451
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,959
effectively because

452
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
clearly you know in some cases we just

453
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
haven't been doing it very well we were

454
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
patting ourselves in the back a little

455
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
bit after the elections you know what

456
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
was that just two months ago because of

457
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,680
how

458
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
looked it looked to be the most secure

459
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
in history right and

460
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
by all testaments indeed it was then not

461
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
you know a matter of weeks later we had

462
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
the first echoes of you know solar winds

463
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,320
coming out

464
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
so that was a you know indeed a bit of a

465
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,360
wake-up call um

466
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
that uh that there's just a lot more

467
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
frankly than that we need to do

468
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,639
uh both here and nationally of course as

469
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
well as internationally to do a better

470
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
job at both you know

471
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
deterrence by denial so ensuring an

472
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,079
appropriate level of due diligence in

473
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
our own systems to protect our critical

474
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,720
infrastructure

475
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
and potentially this idea of persistent

476
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,560
engagement which has been dod

477
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
policy since 2018 this idea of kind of

478
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
active defense

479
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
um and it's going to be really

480
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
interesting to see what the biden

481
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,880
administration does with that

482
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,760
right because there were a lot of

483
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
criticisms back in 2016 that the obama

484
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
administration should have done more

485
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
we've seen that pivot some people think

486
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
it's you know it's it's working

487
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,839
relatively well but

488
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
now at the same time other countries and

489
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,440
not just nato allies are

490
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
using these same tactics right um and

491
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
taking up a bit of a bit of this

492
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,000
emerging norm

493
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,199
and so we have to be comfortable with

494
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,720
the results of that too so that's

495
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
another discussion of course that we can

496
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,560
have

497
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,680
as you know so much of this is

498
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
interrelated which is one reason i find

499
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
it so fascinating

500
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,480
so what can we do about this problem

501
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
again i'm skating through this pretty

502
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,440
quick because i assume

503
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
i'm preaching to the choir here we know

504
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
we're not going to eliminate it this is

505
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,199
an exercise and managing risk just like

506
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,160
we do across

507
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
lots of different contexts right we've

508
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
tried various ways to do that

509
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
um in the cyber context including by

510
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
frankly just spinning a boatload

511
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
on the problem itself you know there's

512
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
varying schools of thought about what

513
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
the appropriate level of investment is

514
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
the the stat you see at the bottom of

515
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,959
the screen there that came from a study

516
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
by larry gordon at the university of

517
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
maryland a couple years ago

518
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,839
i just find it fitting because it's just

519
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
so specific right

520
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,839
which is interesting but it does point

521
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,440
to this bigger issue of whether or not

522
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
we're seeing a market failure you know

523
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
when it comes to cyber security

524
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,360
markets after all very good at producing

525
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,720
private goods um

526
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,199
your your your iphone your laptop etc

527
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,880
not so good at producing public goods

528
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,480
like a healthy environment national

529
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
security should cyber security just be

530
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
considered a component

531
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
of national security if so should the

532
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,120
government have a bigger role

533
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
in guaranteeing it and if that's the

534
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
case how right where's that line between

535
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
dhs for example and cisa protecting our

536
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,519
critical infrastructure since

537
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,839
you know 85 plus percent is in private

538
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,920
hands and when should the you know cyber

539
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,519
command and the dod step in

540
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,120
how should that work in practice and

541
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
those are some of the tough challenges

542
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
we're facing

543
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
you know across all of these different

544
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
sectors but now it's been playing out in

545
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
some interesting ways in iot

546
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,000
in particular which i'll turn to in just

547
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
a minute um just quickly another way

548
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,360
that you know

549
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
sometimes this is thought about these

550
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
days and i see benefits and drawbacks

551
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,519
frankly

552
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,519
in this approach is not only treating

553
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,639
cyber security

554
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,320
as a cost center or ideally a

555
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
competitive advantage right but even as

556
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
a corporate social responsibility to get

557
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,759
back to um you know some of the spaff's

558
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,839
fantastic work in this domain

559
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,639
and you know i see this playing out a

560
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,759
number of ways right

561
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,120
on the one hand and i've written a

562
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
couple articles on this one on

563
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,720
sustainable cyber security and there's

564
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
one on climate change and cyber attacks

565
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
it features in that 2020 book on

566
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
governing new frontiers that i mentioned

567
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,519
earlier too

568
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
there's a lot of tools that have been

569
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,120
developed in the sustainability movement

570
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,839
that could

571
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,839
have some utility in helping us think

572
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,079
about conceptualize

573
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,880
cyber risk these integrated reporting

574
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
frameworks can be useful

575
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
um basically if you're a publicly traded

576
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,839
firm these days

577
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,079
you have to issue basically an annual

578
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,439
sustainability report

579
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,880
which measures the impact of your

580
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
operations you know not only on the

581
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,919
economy um but really on on the

582
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
environment on society on your community

583
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,799
writ large

584
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
there's this movement of esg plus t that

585
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,640
some of you might have heard of

586
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
to include technology within this effort

587
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
and we've seen some companies now

588
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
do that eli lilly actually is an example

589
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
they now include information on privacy

590
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
and cyber security in their integrated

591
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
sustainability

592
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
report which is interesting that doesn't

593
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,559
compel different decision making at the

594
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,840
board level to be clear

595
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
but the idea is it better informs boards

596
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
about the risks they face

597
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
so as you know measuring risk measuring

598
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
potential costs in the cyber context is

599
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
no easy feat there what's the timeline

600
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
right are you worried about identity

601
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
theft 10 years from now how can you hope

602
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
to quantify that today

603
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
there's certificate programs out there

604
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
as well the eu frankly is far ahead of

605
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,840
us

606
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
on that when you think about the iot

607
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,520
context in particular which i'll

608
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
once again say more about in just a

609
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
second we've seen some efforts in the

610
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
in the eu with their ce trust mark uh

611
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
which is you know basically a you know a

612
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
stamp on a box think about energy star

613
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
here in the u.s right and the idea is

614
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
can you distill

615
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
something about cyber security and

616
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
privacy best practices that would

617
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
resonate with a consumer um in a

618
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
meaningful way right would that be color

619
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
coded how could that work

620
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,559
um the uk actually has a cyber

621
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,320
essentials plus certificate that they've

622
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
rolled out that businesses can

623
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
apply to and get and actually put on the

624
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,280
box here in the u.s

625
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
you know frankly it's been more civil

626
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
society driven consumer reports

627
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
does have that in terms of their digital

628
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
standard they've started to rank for

629
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
example smart televisions with regards

630
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,520
to their

631
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
uh their digital standard we were

632
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,799
involved with the capstone project with

633
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
them a couple years ago so that's why i

634
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
know a little bit about that

635
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
um it's it's a wonderful first step

636
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,799
right

637
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,720
but clearly there needs to be a lot more

638
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
coordination not even necessarily from

639
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,120
the government

640
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,559
some of these systems are you know

641
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
frankly pretty private sector driven but

642
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
i think it's an interesting

643
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,000
exercising question that we can grapple

644
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
with as well about

645
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039
could you even design a trust mark for

646
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
iot devices that really would be

647
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
meaningful for consumers

648
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
in in some way right the us chamber was

649
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,919
interested in this idea about a year ago

650
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,360
i haven't heard what's happened with it

651
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,080
since

652
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
but that's another thing that um that

653
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
i'm interested in at least i would love

654
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
to hear your thoughts on

655
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
in terms of managing all these

656
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
vulnerabilities from the bottom up

657
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
again talk about appreciation of the

658
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
choir most of what i'm talking about

659
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
here are eight nine and ten

660
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,919
uh this is borrowing from peter schweier

661
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
um from he's a professor at georgia tech

662
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,799
these days

663
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,960
so you know if you if you use the osi

664
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
stack metaphor that that's kind of what

665
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
what's sitting on top of the stack that

666
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
i'm focusing on now just to help provide

667
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
a little bit of context

668
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
so what can we do at all of these levels

669
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
you know supply chain risk in the iot

670
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
context is just so

671
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,720
tough right um putting aside even solar

672
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
winds i mean this is just such a

673
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
multi-faceted

674
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,919
uh an expensive proposition to really

675
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,679
have a high degree of confidence

676
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
you know for example that your vendor

677
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
network is actually using the nif cyber

678
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
security framework like you say they

679
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,360
should

680
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,240
etc that requires third-party vetting it

681
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
requires actually going out and checking

682
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
potentially

683
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,120
that's tough a lot of companies aren't

684
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
in a good position to actually do that

685
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,159
because we don't do a good job frankly

686
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:22,720
of even

687
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
rewarding security in the iot context at

688
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,200
least so far right and that's starting

689
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,799
to change in some jurisdictions as we'll

690
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,760
turn to

691
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
but you know that that's a core piece of

692
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,679
the problem um you know the protocols

693
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,720
themselves of course

694
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
built on trust that trust can be

695
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
misplaced

696
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
some partial fixes like dns sec you know

697
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
not haven't been

698
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
taken up to the extent that i know a lot

699
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
of us would like to have seen

700
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
interesting about the liability piece um

701
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
we'll talk about this

702
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
in in the context of france in just a

703
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
couple minutes but they've made a pivot

704
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,080
in

705
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
and not not too long ago i think about

706
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
six months ago to start treating

707
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
internet connected devices

708
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
under their products liability law so

709
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
it's a strict liability regime

710
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
and it's early days and i haven't seen

711
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,559
any data about what

712
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
impact that's actually had so far in

713
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
france but if more

714
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
eu member states you know follow

715
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,520
france's lead there

716
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,799
you have to think that's going to have a

717
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,679
pretty big impact um on how uh

718
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
how companies producing internet

719
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
connected devices are going to be

720
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
thinking about security issues in

721
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,640
particular

722
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,720
sure it could impact cost the rate of

723
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,159
innovation but also

724
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,120
you know security at the end of the day

725
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,520
um

726
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
and you know again basic stuff guys we

727
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
got to be proactive building in cyber

728
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
security from the start not bolting it

729
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,840
on after the fact

730
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,600
just one interesting note looking ahead

731
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,039
to the state of who's your cyber

732
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
security 2020 report that i'll turn to

733
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,679
um in just a couple minutes here

734
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,760
corporate governance is all over the map

735
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
at least here in indiana with regards to

736
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,600
organizing for cyber security i was

737
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
frankly hoping that we were going to see

738
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
some consensus about you know a best

739
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,159
practice for how to organize our efforts

740
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
with cyber security in mind basically

741
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,240
how can we not be like equifax

742
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,679
but we haven't gotten that message at

743
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,120
least for you know small and

744
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,039
medium-sized businesses um here in

745
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,600
indiana

746
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
it's really all over the map we saw

747
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
about you know 15 or so percent

748
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
that designated their ceo as in charge

749
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,600
of cyber security another 14

750
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,159
15 percent that designated their ciso

751
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,120
about 12

752
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,679
their chief privacy officer and for a

753
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
sizable percentage there wasn't nobody

754
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
they didn't have

755
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
a an idea a clue about who should be

756
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
responsible at the end of the day so

757
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
if that organization isn't in place it's

758
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
really tough to respond

759
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
appropriately to these so now let's

760
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
focus with a little bit of that context

761
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,760
in mind

762
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
on iot in particular the list that you

763
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
guys see on the screen right here this

764
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,039
came

765
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,600
from a couple of earlier articles

766
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,640
actually

767
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
i did one called win toasters attack

768
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
which came out from

769
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,000
i think that was illinois law review

770
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
back in 2017. i wrote that with

771
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
steve myers along with a couple of the

772
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
co-authors who used to head up

773
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
our secure computing group i'm here at

774
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
uh at iu at the luddy school now it's

775
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,520
called

776
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,679
uh before leaving for apple a couple

777
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,880
years ago

778
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
and you know as part of that project we

779
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
got asked by the senate commerce

780
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
committee to

781
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
to write up you know from a policy

782
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,559
perspective what we thought

783
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
of as some of the more useful takeaways

784
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
um and again this is this is dated right

785
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,640
this was a couple years ago but these

786
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
are some of the takeaways that we had

787
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,360
suggested

788
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,720
you know at the time um and you know you

789
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
could take a glance of them um some some

790
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,600
we've made progress

791
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
on in the in the intervening couple

792
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,799
years here right um nist

793
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,200
clearly this is on their radar um a lot

794
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
of groups including the us chamber are

795
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
pushing you know this to come up with uh

796
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,080
with an iot specific uh framework both

797
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,400
for

798
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
security and privacy and frankly these

799
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,400
days even supply chain it doesn't make a

800
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
lot of sense to have all these

801
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
artificial barriers you could argue

802
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,679
um and also there's been some efforts on

803
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,799
number four there

804
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
so there was a there was a reform

805
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,120
proposal this was the cyber security

806
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
and internet of things act of um i think

807
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
it was 20

808
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
2017 because there was a new version in

809
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
2019 and it basically would have done

810
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
number four all right and it would have

811
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,400
even included under government

812
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,960
procurement for kind of main best

813
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,039
practices and it was simple stuff so

814
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,000
basically like

815
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
uh the government wouldn't be allowed to

816
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
buy products that had hard-coded

817
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,000
passwords or that couldn't be updated

818
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
things like that um as many of you know

819
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,679
government government procurement this

820
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,880
is this is a good way

821
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
to help start the conversation but by no

822
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,559
means

823
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,640
does the federal government have the the

824
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
overwhelming purchasing power

825
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
um as it did you know 25 years ago for

826
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,559
example in this space so

827
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,480
it would be you know to an extent a shot

828
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
across the bow a useful shot

829
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
um but it would only be a kind of the

830
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,640
first step in a longer marathon there

831
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,039
we haven't seen number five as much yet

832
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,400
we have seen the federal trade

833
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,159
commission get involved in

834
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
data breaches with regards to you could

835
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,960
kind of classify them loosely as iot

836
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
companies or companies producing

837
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,320
internet connected devices

838
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
particularly that's the case when they

839
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
advertise themselves as

840
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
at having something like in class cyber

841
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,799
security

842
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
looking at you like lifelock those kind

843
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
of companies if you advertise it and you

844
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
don't have it they're going to come

845
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,320
after you

846
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
um and there's other there's other

847
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,679
avenues where they're more likely

848
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,799
including if you're in a critical

849
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,320
infrastructure context and there's a lot

850
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
of overlap here right

851
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
like we know in healthcare a lot of

852
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
medical devices these days are

853
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,679
internet connected so so there's so

854
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,360
there's been some efforts there and it's

855
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,799
going to be interesting to see with the

856
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,400
new biden administration

857
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,279
what happens next right is ftc i'm going

858
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,679
to get you know for example more

859
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
more authority or more resources um to

860
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
go after this in a more meaningful way

861
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
those type of perpetrators um so

862
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
expanding just ever so briefly these are

863
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
some of those efforts and and some

864
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
greater detail i mentioned

865
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
um the top couple there already there is

866
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
i haven't heard of him introducing it

867
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
again uh in this current congress yet

868
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,360
but there is this congressman from

869
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,000
georgia

870
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,559
um named graves is the surname and he's

871
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,159
been introducing this bill the last

872
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,120
couple of cycles

873
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
that would basically legalize active

874
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,279
defense so kind of private sector

875
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
hackback frankly

876
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,120
so long as the companies did so under

877
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
fbi supervision

878
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
really bad idea in my opinion on a lot

879
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,159
of levels um

880
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,159
dealing with attribution escalation

881
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,520
concerns etc

882
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,440
but the last time it was introduced it

883
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
did have a bipartisan co-sponsor and

884
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
there have been some states where this

885
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,279
has gotten close to passing including

886
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,159
georgia

887
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,760
the former governor of georgia actually

888
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
had to veto it but

889
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,600
it got to his desk right so what used to

890
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,960
be frankly a

891
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,279
kind of a fringe concept is still is

892
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,320
still there

893
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,559
um and it's it's interesting to see what

894
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,520
if anything is gonna

895
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,240
gonna happen with that um going forward

896
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
a lot is more interesting those

897
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
state-level initiatives

898
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,720
that i would like to talk just kind of

899
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
briefly about including not only what's

900
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,279
happening in california but also ohio

901
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,799
right in a number of states which are

902
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,400
experimenting with a variety of

903
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
provisions around safe harbor

904
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
protections as well as just defining for

905
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,520
kind of quote unquote reasonable cyber

906
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
security and what that looks like

907
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,200
but quickly at the federal level the ftc

908
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,039
they got under some pressure a couple

909
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,039
years ago after a circuit court

910
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,720
decision involving this company named

911
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
labmd to be more specific

912
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,279
about what they mean when they talk

913
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,279
about things like industry-leading cyber

914
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
security they were they were using some

915
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,360
ambiguous language for a while there so

916
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
this is the ftc's effort to do exactly

917
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
that it's a bit of a david letterman

918
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,000
style

919
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
top 10 list so they put out this kind of

920
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
guide for business

921
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
on cyber security matters a couple years

922
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,840
ago with the thinking that

923
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
if you follow these including iot

924
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
companies

925
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
that doesn't guarantee that the ftc

926
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,640
won't come knocking

927
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
following a data breach but the idea is

928
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
that it would at least make it less

929
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,159
likely

930
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,840
then of course the nist cyber security

931
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
framework is still playing out here this

932
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,480
is now

933
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,200
gosh um seven years old we have version

934
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
1.1

935
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
out it's done a lot to define you know

936
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,840
or at least help

937
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,520
help a lot of businesses think about

938
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,760
cyber security due diligence in some new

939
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,240
ways

940
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,880
including in the iot context and i would

941
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
just mention that more now more than 25

942
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,320
countries around the world are

943
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
implementing versions

944
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
of the nist cyber security framework

945
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
even the eu now has something called the

946
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,240
nis

947
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,399
platform the network information

948
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,240
security platform which uses the same

949
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,880
language

950
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
so we seem to be coming together at

951
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,039
least on some core concepts of cyber

952
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,120
security risk management even as we're

953
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,399
frankly diverging

954
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
with regards to bigger questions of data

955
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
governance and privacy protections

956
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,679
even though you think those would just

957
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,760
be the two sides of the same coin and

958
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,200
this is just an example of what i just

959
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,080
mentioned with

960
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,919
countries um this came from an article

961
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,279
we did a couple years ago for a

962
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,039
symposium i think it was called bottoms

963
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,679
up

964
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,760
um i can find that i can i'll try to

965
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
post some links in the chat box here

966
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,120
when we get to that point um and this

967
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,559
just goes through some of the country we

968
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,320
looked at in some detail to show how

969
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
that overlap

970
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,880
is playing out which is good news to an

971
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
extent for businesses doing business

972
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
across all these jurisdictions

973
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
of course with gdpr this comes into play

974
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,320
um

975
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
we're i'm doing an article with scott

976
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,440
bradner who some of you folks may know

977
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,320
um and the uh we did we've done two now

978
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
actually but this this one

979
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,080
is is focused on iot security issues and

980
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,720
particularly comparing the us in the eu

981
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,919
right um so even under gdpr there are

982
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,120
some provisions

983
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
um that kind of resonate with the iot

984
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
context in particular it of course

985
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,159
wasn't written

986
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,399
you know with iot specifically in mind

987
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
these regulations take a long time to

988
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,799
come together

989
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
you know but some of these concepts such

990
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
as around you know data portability

991
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
um vendor management do have a lot of

992
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,720
implications of thinking about

993
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,799
iot security and you know can provide

994
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,159
something of a foundation

995
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
uh for businesses as they think about

996
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
deploying these services globally

997
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
really interesting time to have for how

998
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
to do that right um lily you know for

999
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,159
example because i use that

1000
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
that uh reference earlier they're now

1001
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
using gdpr globally right for all their

1002
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,120
operations

1003
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
um lots of lots of businesses are others

1004
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,919
like microsoft are using you know ccpa

1005
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,080
uh california's approach so even though

1006
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,679
we're not seeing action at the federal

1007
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,240
level

1008
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
that doesn't mean that these decisions

1009
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
and you know discussions aren't taking

1010
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,559
place

1011
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,559
um it's just that we're pretty late to

1012
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,919
the game so it's going to be some

1013
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,919
combination of the eu's approach as

1014
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,919
a global baseline with some companies

1015
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,200
and countries following

1016
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
the more transparency focused california

1017
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
approach and others of course

1018
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,799
following a you know approach of cyber

1019
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,720
sovereignty not to you know put you find

1020
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,600
a point on it

1021
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
so you know whether that's going to lead

1022
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
to a bifurcation of this internet of

1023
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,159
things concept or not

1024
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,240
um we'll see right it definitely seems

1025
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,480
to be heading that direction

1026
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,559
so in terms of approaches to iot

1027
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,320
security and governance writ large

1028
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
here are just some of the main concepts

1029
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,600
that we've

1030
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
distilled especially that last article

1031
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,039
that i mentioned with scott bradner

1032
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,799
we we have a section at the end of it

1033
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,080
where we talk about each of these in

1034
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,120
some detail

1035
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,919
as i said you know some states like ohio

1036
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,520
indiana tried to do this for what it's

1037
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,919
worth

1038
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,279
last year the the previous ag proposed

1039
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:55,840
it

1040
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
the governor nixed it didn't go anywhere

1041
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
but they proposed an idea of a safe

1042
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,000
harbor

1043
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,760
but the indiana version from last year

1044
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,440
would have only used the nist cyber

1045
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,279
security framework whereas the ohio

1046
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,840
version

1047
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
has a couple of other options as well

1048
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
that's one idea that's out there

1049
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,279
reasonableness standards are out there

1050
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
california for example defines

1051
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
reasonable cyber security for internet

1052
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,399
connected devices

1053
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,720
in terms of the top 20 cis security

1054
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
controls

1055
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
um so that's one way to go about it and

1056
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
that's now a requirement as of

1057
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,679
last january and it started being

1058
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,880
enforced last summer

1059
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,279
in california there's disclosure

1060
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,799
requirements that's another way to get

1061
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,120
at this problem codes of conduct that's

1062
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
kind of interesting

1063
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
in terms of industry groups working

1064
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,399
together to develop these types of iot

1065
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,559
security codes

1066
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,240
that there's actually an affirmative

1067
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,720
defense written into gdpr

1068
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
to encourage companies to do that so

1069
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
basically if you get hit

1070
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
with a fine from the european commission

1071
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
but you can show that you were a good

1072
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,279
citizen you helped develop some of these

1073
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,320
codes of conduct

1074
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
then you can have those potentially you

1075
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
know quite massive fines

1076
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,080
reduced talked about trust marks that's

1077
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
happening to an extent

1078
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
products liability is kind of if you put

1079
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
this on a spectrum kind of the most

1080
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,960
extreme example there

1081
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,640
and it would have you know obviously

1082
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
profound implications if that was taken

1083
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
up more broadly it'll be interesting to

1084
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,000
see what happens in france in particular

1085
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,399
as that gets rolled out and there is

1086
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,679
just a bit of a spectrum

1087
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
um that i just that i just referenced

1088
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,919
there just in the interest of time i

1089
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,880
won't get into

1090
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
this in any detail but this is the idea

1091
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,960
of how

1092
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,679
how to think about our success to date

1093
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,200
at governing this space

1094
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
and um the lynn ostrom tradition here at

1095
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,240
the

1096
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,320
at the workshop at iu we've they've

1097
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
developed lots of different governance

1098
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,480
frameworks

1099
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,799
over the years which looks to see um

1100
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,919
basically

1101
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,120
at the appearance and to the degree to

1102
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,880
which each of these design principles

1103
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,440
used to be

1104
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,519
lifted listed i'm sorry at the left of

1105
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,640
the screen are

1106
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,200
present in a particular resource domain

1107
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,799
and if you can show that more and more

1108
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
of these are indeed present then there's

1109
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,360
basically

1110
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,919
a greater likelihood for meeting various

1111
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,840
you know collective action goals

1112
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
um it's you can't draw a direct line

1113
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
there it's a correlation at best but

1114
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,440
we did do that as part of this project

1115
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,799
as well so happy to talk to about that

1116
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,000
more if anybody's interested

1117
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,360
too uh but just in the interest of time

1118
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,799
because i think if i remember right i'm

1119
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,159
supposed to cut off

1120
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,440
in five minutes is that right

1121
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,080
potentially

1122
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,039
maybe hearing no objections i'm going to

1123
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,610
assume

1124
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,880
[Laughter]

1125
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
a little longer it's it's more a matter

1126
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
of just being sure that there's some

1127
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,360
time

1128
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
to answer questions if they come up but

1129
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
you've got to look still half past the

1130
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,240
hour

1131
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
okay okay so we got technically the

1132
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,279
class runs till

1133
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,200
5 20. okay 420 joe oh 5

1134
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
20. okay great thanks for watching yeah

1135
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,320
i i doubt anybody's going to walk out

1136
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,480
oh that's no way i get it no it's okay

1137
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,679
it's tough when it's in the evenings

1138
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,559
like this there's family

1139
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,640
responsibilities et cetera

1140
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
i'm happy to pause there for a second

1141
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
too if anybody had you know questions or

1142
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
comments on the more of the iot stuff

1143
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,080
because i'd like to pivot if that's okay

1144
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,919
and just spend the next kind of ten or

1145
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,519
five five or ten minutes giving you a

1146
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,600
few highlights um from the state of

1147
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
hoosier cyber security report

1148
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,199
um and then of course reserve the last

1149
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,560
five ten minutes just for any other

1150
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,159
questions but

1151
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
any questions so far guys or any

1152
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,520
comments that i can help with

1153
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
i know that was basically a fire hose so

1154
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,800
it's okay it's okay if not

1155
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
okay here hearing nothing so far um i

1156
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,960
will just keep persevering here feel

1157
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,639
free of course to use the chat box or

1158
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,399
the q a i just see as well which is

1159
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,520
great

1160
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,159
um oh george okay great yeah let me just

1161
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
check this out really quick

1162
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,760
can everybody see i forget if everybody

1163
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,199
can see the questions or not

1164
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,359
but just in case if not as as fedramp

1165
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
standardizes an approach to enable

1166
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,119
agencies to adapt

1167
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,000
um to cloud services under the general

1168
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
services administration and is governed

1169
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,359
by omb dhsamb

1170
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,440
would iot be well placed in this

1171
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,640
government's body

1172
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
interesting question potentially

1173
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,920
potentially so

1174
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,520
um iot itself is such a broad

1175
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,560
concept you know frankly i worry about

1176
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,160
it being placed anywhere and having much

1177
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,960
in fact

1178
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
you know it's kind of like the idea of

1179
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
critical infrastructure right i mean

1180
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
gosh the way we've we've parsed that in

1181
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,560
terms of these you know 16

1182
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,680
uh sectors under dhs plus at this point

1183
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
i mean it's basically the mass the vast

1184
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
majority of the us economy is now

1185
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,880
critical right

1186
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
and that begs the question if everything

1187
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
is critical is anything critical and i

1188
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,240
think we run the risk of maybe doing

1189
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
something similar in the iot context

1190
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,359
because

1191
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
as i said earlier we're really hurtling

1192
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
toward this world in some ways we're

1193
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
already there

1194
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,680
of by default having so many of our

1195
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
products and services connected to the

1196
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
internet that

1197
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,960
i i just i'd be shocked that there was a

1198
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,680
a

1199
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
a regulator frankly anywhere who could

1200
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
wrap their arms around all of these

1201
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,480
interlinking

1202
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
issues right so what do you do you could

1203
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,520
parse

1204
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
and i'd love to hear your thoughts on

1205
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,560
this anybody including usepath you could

1206
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,079
parse it out the kind of the way we did

1207
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,079
in the critical infrastructure context

1208
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,240
um you know a lot of these iot

1209
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,920
applications are already being used and

1210
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
those various kind of critical

1211
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,480
infrastructure silos

1212
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,000
if you want to break down some of those

1213
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520
barriers maybe you could do more of an

1214
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,240
iso

1215
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,280
approach for iot in particular

1216
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,880
that could be that could be one way

1217
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,200
forward you know cisa has obviously

1218
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,800
done some great work for critical

1219
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
infrastructure protection and election

1220
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,040
security

1221
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
maybe there could be a task force more

1222
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960
focused on iot concerns

1223
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
i don't see any of that happening

1224
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,480
quickly a lot of it um is just being

1225
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
rolled out frankly at the

1226
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,920
at the state level which is why i wanted

1227
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
to turn to this you know this example

1228
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
now but it's such a great question so

1229
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,880
thanks and i'm happy to return to that

1230
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
and if anybody has other better ideas

1231
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
i'd love to hear them frankly

1232
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
i would say as well that there are if

1233
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,920
you guys haven't seen it in the

1234
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
cyberspace solarium commission report

1235
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,160
there are several you know iot

1236
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
uh both discussions and suggestions for

1237
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
reform efforts some of which you've

1238
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
already discussed during government

1239
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,920
procurement

1240
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
et cetera but there are some other good

1241
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,720
ideas in there and i think those will

1242
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,160
get some new attention

1243
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,000
um now with the new administration it

1244
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
was really unfortunate timing because

1245
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
that was rolled out to my recollection

1246
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,320
last march

1247
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,359
and there were a few other things

1248
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,040
happening last march so they kind of got

1249
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
lost in the noise

1250
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
um but guys in terms of this this report

1251
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,240
itself um

1252
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,280
i will just so folks can

1253
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
uh can check it out if you're interested

1254
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,240
i'll put this in the

1255
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,560
in the chat box really quick for you

1256
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
here is state of hoosier

1257
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,520
cyber security 2020 okay and this is

1258
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
the version that ibrc hosts so here we

1259
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,240
go

1260
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,640
here we go i love it here it is

1261
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,760
hopefully that worked okay

1262
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,960
i'd love any comments critiques etc

1263
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
um you know the report itself has only

1264
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,960
been out a little over a month at this

1265
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,520
point

1266
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,160
um so and it's just a first effort right

1267
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,200
would love to do

1268
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
something similar to compare other

1269
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
states one of my collaborators on this

1270
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,960
is uh from the university of arizona so

1271
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
we're hoping to do something similar in

1272
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,040
arizona

1273
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
and even of course it'd be great to go

1274
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,400
back in a couple years and see how we're

1275
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,359
doing

1276
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,880
along some of these various metrics okay

1277
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,440
so plenty of caveats et cetera plenty of

1278
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,720
things to keep in mind

1279
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,520
um so you know uh first off we should

1280
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,839
put

1281
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,000
just just a quick note of context we

1282
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,920
this was sent out because we did it

1283
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,839
in partnership with the indiana attorney

1284
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,920
general's office uh we got help from the

1285
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
secretary of state's office

1286
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
help from ibrc so it went out to a

1287
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
couple thousand organizations across

1288
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,880
indiana at the end of the day

1289
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
gosh i can't remember the specific

1290
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
number i'm so sorry i think we had

1291
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,640
something around

1292
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
300 or 400 responses so by no means you

1293
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,520
know did we have a

1294
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,320
you know 90 response rate we did have

1295
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,800
you know

1296
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,240
we didn't have a one percent response

1297
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
rate either so you know take these

1298
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
results in other words with a grain of

1299
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,240
salt

1300
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
uh but it does you know at least

1301
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
highlight some important takeaways and

1302
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,599
we're in the process now of

1303
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,440
parsing some of these data a bit more

1304
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
carefully including critical

1305
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
infrastructure non-critical

1306
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,040
infrastructure small

1307
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,520
medium-sized businesses etc so that'll

1308
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,720
be coming

1309
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,960
um but so some some good news some bad

1310
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
news as is classic right on the good

1311
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
news side of the ledger

1312
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,839
95 of organizations across indiana are

1313
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,760
either somewhat or very concerned about

1314
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
cyber risk i'm not sure if that's good

1315
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,520
news or bad news per se but at least

1316
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
at least the word was getting out right

1317
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,000
and as we see here compared to other

1318
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,720
types

1319
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,200
of potential harms um it's it's kind of

1320
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,160
in a category

1321
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,640
all of its own in terms of likelihood um

1322
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,440
of occurring

1323
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
and the degree of harm if it did right

1324
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,200
which is again

1325
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,880
it's good news that at least people are

1326
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
aware of this problem

1327
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,520
and um and taking it seriously in terms

1328
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,000
of which

1329
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
types of incidents that uh organizations

1330
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,040
across indiana were most concerned about

1331
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
you can take a look at the list there i

1332
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,160
think you know some

1333
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,400
semi surprises but a lot of usual

1334
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,880
suspects especially given the news

1335
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
and how much you know ransomware for

1336
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
example has dominated that even even

1337
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,599
before the pandemic though of course

1338
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,160
we've seen

1339
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,320
quite a few incidents since then as well

1340
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,599
um fishing of course

1341
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,960
fraud um not really much awareness of

1342
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
the problem of insider threats

1343
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,319
right which should again for many of us

1344
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,520
come as no surprise

1345
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
necessarily but they really did play out

1346
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,119
in uh in these data as well

1347
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,560
in terms of consequences um this is what

1348
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
was listed you guys can see the chart

1349
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,720
there

1350
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,560
uh in terms of what organizations were

1351
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
most concerned about particularly

1352
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,680
information loss

1353
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,520
you know identity theft system downtime

1354
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,760
was quite high interestingly

1355
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
and again this was done before so most

1356
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
of these data were collected

1357
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,920
another exercise of unfortunate timing

1358
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,760
right around the time the pandemic was

1359
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,520
really taking off kind of

1360
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,560
late last spring um disinformation

1361
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,079
wasn't as high up there i'd be

1362
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,119
interesting now

1363
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,280
right given all the events of the last

1364
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,200
six months how that might play out

1365
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,000
differently but back

1366
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,440
then it wasn't as high as those other

1367
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,599
categories

1368
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
another bit of good news most

1369
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,599
organizations had not reported at least

1370
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,520
experiencing a cyber attack in the past

1371
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,800
three years of course you remember the

1372
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
terrible joke

1373
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,160
about how many of these you know

1374
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
actually had and weren't aware of that

1375
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,400
fact

1376
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
um but you know at least a little bit of

1377
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,720
good news uh in terms of you know no uh

1378
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
but some you know no response as well

1379
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,160
was was was kind of dominant there

1380
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,400
and then uh it's interesting as well in

1381
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,920
terms of how that broke down between

1382
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,280
critical infrastructure

1383
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
and non-critical infrastructure right so

1384
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,319
lower percentage there about half

1385
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,000
for critical infrastructure sectors

1386
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,079
which again something of a success story

1387
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,240
perhaps thanks to the isacs who knows

1388
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,839
more of the focus from cisa on that

1389
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,960
particular problem

1390
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,480
interesting follow-up questions there to

1391
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
ask but the word seems to be getting out

1392
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,520
a little bit more

1393
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,240
in that context we did not ask about iot

1394
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,880
in particular

1395
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,960
probably should have in this survey at

1396
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
least to my recollection i think we

1397
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,760
asked about some byod

1398
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,839
policies but that would be another you

1399
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,280
know great follow-up if anybody's

1400
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,560
interested

1401
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,800
so types of cyber attack actually

1402
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,880
experience so instead of the concern

1403
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
these are actually what has been

1404
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,119
happening

1405
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,880
as reported by these organizations you

1406
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,040
guys can see the breakdown up there

1407
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
all these charts are in that report as

1408
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,640
well that the link again is in the chat

1409
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,359
box so

1410
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,480
if you missed something and want to

1411
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
refer back to it or you want more detail

1412
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,640
about

1413
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,160
how each of these is actually working i

1414
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,440
just encourage you to you know take a

1415
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,319
look at that

1416
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
these are just some highlights after all

1417
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
um consequences of the attack uh

1418
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,359
that you know was reported obviously

1419
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,119
data being actually exposed

1420
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,280
unfortunately was the highest percentage

1421
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,920
there

1422
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
um again on the lower side

1423
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
disinformation

1424
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,599
uh credit monitoring of course this kind

1425
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
of plays out with what you often see

1426
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,640
that very few people

1427
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
um actually wind up purchasing credit

1428
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,720
monitoring even when it is offered

1429
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,839
system downtime up there identity theft

1430
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,480
you know and fraud uh both both there as

1431
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
well

1432
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
um another bit of good news the vast

1433
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,960
majority of the organizations we

1434
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
surveyed reported taking

1435
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,280
some affirmative steps to manage the

1436
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
cyber risks that they face

1437
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,839
94 their critical infrastructure

1438
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,240
classified organizations so health care

1439
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,280
finance etc reported taking um

1440
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
these cyber incident reprevention steps

1441
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,319
and 88

1442
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,160
so not too much different but still not

1443
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,680
quite as high of non-critical

1444
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,040
infrastructure sectors so

1445
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,280
maybe that designation is having some

1446
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
some impact perhaps the word is getting

1447
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
out to some extent

1448
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,359
what types of steps were taken um this

1449
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,200
is how the findings broke down there in

1450
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,079
terms of

1451
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,240
antivirus of course software being quite

1452
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
high update and patching

1453
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
we did ask some questions about whether

1454
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,880
patching was done automatically or not

1455
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,800
of course that plays into this

1456
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,079
so there's some information there in the

1457
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,000
report too uh

1458
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,480
password changing interesting you see up

1459
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,119
there

1460
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,200
steps taken to prevent more than half

1461
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,240
talked about the

1462
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,400
the either either purchasing or being in

1463
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,640
the process of purchasing cyber risk

1464
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,440
insurance

1465
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,200
for better or worse so we'll turn to

1466
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,280
that in just a moment too

1467
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,839
why didn't they do more look at that the

1468
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,760
number one reason is they were frankly

1469
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,280
unsure

1470
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,520
about what preventative steps should be

1471
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,319
taken right

1472
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,000
with a lot fewer saying it was too

1473
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,079
expensive or too difficult or just not

1474
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:06,720
being aware

1475
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
right that their organization was at

1476
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,240
risk so i mean that just tells me that

1477
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,440
despite the progress

1478
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,319
we've made um about screaming this is

1479
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,359
really a problem

1480
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,200
we really need to do more especially for

1481
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
those small and medium-sized businesses

1482
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,119
across indiana here in the midwest you

1483
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,560
could argue but of course

1484
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
nationally and indeed even globally

1485
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,079
about really what those

1486
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,079
easy preventative steps are thinking

1487
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,680
back to that you know ftc guide for

1488
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,440
business for example how can we distill

1489
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,400
that down

1490
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,319
and not just have it be a message during

1491
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,920
cyber security awareness month in

1492
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,560
october

1493
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,640
but year round oh okay

1494
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,079
i apparently forgot to include

1495
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,839
information on the other cyber risk

1496
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,200
insurance component part in the deck

1497
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,680
guys

1498
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,079
but as i said just in brief 50 plus

1499
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,960
percent

1500
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,560
did purchase insurance another 15 to 20

1501
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,880
percent of my recollection were

1502
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
in the process of purchasing or

1503
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,000
considering

1504
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,400
purchasing cyber risk insurance one key

1505
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,480
finding on the insurance side was

1506
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
very few organizations were aware of

1507
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,720
what types of coverage they had

1508
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,920
in those policies and especially what

1509
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,359
exclusions might

1510
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,359
apply and i'm just in the process right

1511
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,280
now on that last piece of finishing up

1512
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,160
an article

1513
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,720
called war games and it's all about the

1514
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,680
act of war

1515
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,160
and hostile acts exclusion in the cyber

1516
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,079
risk insurance policies because

1517
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,240
of the prevalence of nation state you

1518
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,760
know sponsored attacks

1519
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,599
um and espionage campaigns for that

1520
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
matter like solar winds

1521
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,079
it it it can happen uh we just not not

1522
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,680
pet you a lot in this specific example

1523
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,880
it can happen that

1524
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,040
you can be denied coverage from your

1525
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,640
insurance provider even if you do have a

1526
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,319
policy in place that you think

1527
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,839
would cover a particular incident

1528
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,920
because of a public attribution for

1529
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,680
example from the u.s government back to

1530
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,880
russia

1531
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,359
in that case of not that yet so it's

1532
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,720
worth that issue is working its way

1533
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,839
through the courts now

1534
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,280
there are some interesting ways in which

1535
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
the insurance industry is trying to

1536
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,560
adjust and use some different language

1537
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,079
and terminology

1538
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,920
to kind of get around this problem but

1539
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,440
it does make it it

1540
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,880
we're seeing the process play out

1541
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
whereas even though more and more

1542
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,480
organizations are buying cyber risk

1543
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,119
insurance

1544
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,599
what's being covered is frankly

1545
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,480
shrinking

1546
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,800
and the cost especially frankly because

1547
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,960
of solar winds and the pandemic is is

1548
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,599
going up

1549
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,000
right so obviously only only a piece of

1550
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,720
this puzzle

1551
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
really tough to get insurance coverage

1552
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,000
even in the best of times

1553
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,839
for things that's tougher to quantify

1554
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,440
like intellectual property

1555
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
um or of course impact on brand uh you

1556
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,440
can get it for more things like

1557
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,839
um you know system downtime credit

1558
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
monitoring services stuff like that

1559
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
so happy it looks like we have only a

1560
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,240
couple minutes which i really apologize

1561
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,000
for i'll turn to these questions in the

1562
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,400
chat box happy to take any others too

1563
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,720
i'm looking at lauren's first here about

1564
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,480
how difficult is it to balance between

1565
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
having public information about the

1566
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,440
security of companies

1567
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,359
and having that information available to

1568
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,599
hackers does making the public

1569
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,359
make things more vulnerable great

1570
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,599
question we see that play out

1571
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,359
especially in this idea of the

1572
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,680
vulnerabilities equities process which

1573
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,160
is

1574
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,920
basically the process by which you know

1575
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,440
governments way

1576
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,560
whether or not to let everybody know or

1577
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,000
let vendors know

1578
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,920
about uh vulnerabilities when they're

1579
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,480
made aware and when they basically get

1580
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,520
withheld

1581
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,599
for use frankly as cyber weapons and we

1582
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,800
see some of the results

1583
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,559
of that with the shadow brokers you know

1584
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,720
for example breach a few years ago

1585
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,480
um there's differing schools of thought

1586
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,079
about the best way to do that obviously

1587
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,599
the vendors the industry

1588
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,000
wants to have a just a norm of 100

1589
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,920
disclosure let the public know

1590
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,359
let the vendors know they'd like to

1591
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,200
first of course then let the public know

1592
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,880
as you point out there the difficulty is

1593
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,640
well that lets the criminals know too

1594
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,160
so best practice there would be a

1595
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,400
coordinated disclosure so let the vendor

1596
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
know have a timeline for remediation

1597
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,599
getting a patch out

1598
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,800
and then you know potentially let the

1599
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,960
public know um after that the best

1600
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
online resource resources for the most

1601
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,240
up-to-date information

1602
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,520
on manufacturing okay um so

1603
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,319
i did a whole separate we did a report

1604
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,240
at our manufacturing initiative

1605
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,960
um down here at uh iu i'm getting the

1606
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,839
exact name

1607
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,280
of the of that i think it's the

1608
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
institute at the um o'neill school

1609
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,520
um but it was uh i did an article that

1610
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,720
came from that report

1611
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,160
on securing um the

1612
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
an internet of industrial things that's

1613
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,160
what it was basically a smart factory's

1614
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,720
article

1615
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,559
and we went and we briefed the house

1616
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,400
manufacturing caucus on that a couple

1617
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,280
years ago

1618
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,400
um so i i would i'll just put that in

1619
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,760
the chat box here if you're

1620
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,359
there's not a ton written at least from

1621
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,880
the academic side in that

1622
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,800
so the industrial internet

1623
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,559
of things if you just do a search for

1624
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,400
that that should come up

1625
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,480
and give you some information i know our

1626
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,520
local

1627
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,040
manufacturers association here in

1628
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,119
indiana i gave a talk for them on some

1629
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,960
of that but i know they're really active

1630
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,960
so if you or somebody else is interested

1631
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,319
i would be happy to find

1632
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,000
whoever that contact person is and get

1633
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,040
you in touch because they're going to

1634
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,920
have more and

1635
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,000
a useful on-the-ground perspective for

1636
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
uh how that's playing out

1637
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,040
and then let's see krasimir's question

1638
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,319
here as well have you considered that

1639
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,760
getting insurance as an equivalent to

1640
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,880
improving yeah

1641
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,240
specifically showing breaches are

1642
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
acceptable as a cost of doing business

1643
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,760
and the insurance is just a way to

1644
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,480
offset the expanse and amortize it over

1645
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:16,800
time

1646
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,040
absolutely right and that's like that's

1647
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,559
a key problem with this whole

1648
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,800
whole domain especially if you try to

1649
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,920
incentivize

1650
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,839
you know the purchase of an insurance

1651
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,000
from a policy perspective right

1652
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,480
and um there's been some efforts at you

1653
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,400
know trying to do that uh because a lot

1654
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,040
of businesses

1655
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,559
just can't get insurance they have too

1656
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,240
many uh vulnerabilities they have too

1657
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
many holes in their system

1658
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,559
so um you're right that could lead to

1659
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,319
the classic moral hazard you know

1660
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,280
dilemma so

1661
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,119
you think you're covered you purchase

1662
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,520
the policy and you don't put in a place

1663
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
in the proactive cyber security best

1664
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,280
practices that we all know

1665
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,160
are absolutely essential for not only

1666
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,200
protecting your own

1667
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,800
networks and your employees and your

1668
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,240
customers but frankly

1669
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,720
the wider internet-connected ecosystem

1670
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,920
that we've been talking about

1671
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,640
a little bit together this afternoon so

1672
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,119
yes

1673
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,559
in short um i i also am leery

1674
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,280
about this i think it's it's a useful

1675
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,839
tool

1676
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,160
especially for small businesses which

1677
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,760
you know even in the best of times might

1678
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,319
only be

1679
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,559
one fraudulent wire transfer away from

1680
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,760
going out of business

1681
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,920
but it cannot be a substitute you're

1682
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
absolutely right um crasmere for

1683
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,839
for those other types of more proactive

1684
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,440
actions that that need to happen to

1685
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,079

1686
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,520
