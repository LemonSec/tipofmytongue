1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
and so let me start by welcoming our our

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,679
audience

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,399
to the final security seminar of the

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,600
semester

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,320
we'll be taking a break after this

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,799
and resuming in mid-january

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,360
so you can check out the webpage for

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,080
uh who the next speakers are going to be

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,119
of course

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,600
all these talks are archived through our

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
website and on youtube

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
our speakers will

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
entertain questions in the q a section

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,519
so please don't enter them in a chat if

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,320
you

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
if you have an issue with uh being able

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,920
to hear or or see some of the talk you

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
can you can type in the chat we'll be

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
monitoring that but questions for the

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
speaker should be in the q a

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
and speaking of speakers

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
uh absolutely delighted that for the end

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
of the semester we have not one but two

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
experts here to tell you about a really

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
fascinating report that they have done

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,920
uh

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,719
the

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,719
title here integrating cyber capacity

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,438
into the digital development agenda is

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,920
is something that has global impact

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
and importance for developing economies

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
and developed economies globally

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
our two speakers melissa hathaway

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
somebody i've had the pleasure of

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
knowing for about 20 years now

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
who's been doing innovative work in in

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,840
security and information systems in

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
longer than that

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
uh and francesca spedalia who uh helped

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,720
her with this report and the two of them

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,439
will

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,680
present to you this afternoon so

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
uh please take it away and our thanks

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
for being here

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
great well thank you so much dr stafford

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
gene it's good to see you and uh and

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
we're really excited to be able to

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
present um

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
this report uh

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
here at purdue um

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
and uh we uh francesca and i had the

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
opportunity and were asked to work on

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
this report by the world bank and the

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
global forum on cyber expertise and

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
those two institutions came together

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
back in june of 2021

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
identifying the need to bridge these two

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
communities the cyber security community

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
thinking about more digital resilience

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
as we're spending so much money under

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
digital development and how can we start

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
to incorporate the benefits

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
of de-risking our cyber security into

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
the projects and the initiatives in

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
order to achieve more resilient outcomes

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
we had the opportunity to launch this

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
report last week on the 30th of november

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
and um and we're going to highlight some

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,760
of the key uh aspects the findings the

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,720
recommendations where we think things

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
are going to head over the next

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
hopefully year or more or longer

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
and um

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
and it would be remiss if we didn't

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
thank the world bank in the global forum

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
on cyber expertise that foundation for

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
asking us to do this because we think

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
it's going to have global impact uh and

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,239
help build stronger communities

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
in each of the recipient countries but

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
and hopefully bridge the two communities

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
cyber security community with the

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,440
digital development uh community

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
and the multilateral development banks

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
so the project objective was

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
could we really look at pathways to

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
better align digital development with

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
cyber security

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
into the broader digital development

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
agenda

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
what are their best practices or

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
effective methods to bridge those gaps

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
can we start to talk about digital

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
development digital resiliency cyber

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
security capacity building writ large

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
um what is stopping these two

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
communities from working together uh

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,239
are there successful programs or public

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,080
goods digital public goods is what we

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
identify in the report and we identify a

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
number of digital public goods that

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
could be repurposed and used by the

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
broader community

104
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
we also identified some um projects

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,439
where cyber security uh and digital

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,560
resilience were already embedded so

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
sort of the narrative of or you could

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,599
look at this one as something that would

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
be a great example for

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
uh looking up for when you do it in your

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
country or when another multilateral

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,759
development bank or

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,279
a funding institution comes along

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,400
and then um uh finally we looked at you

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
know again how do you achieve more

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
resilient outcomes the mechanisms to

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
embed cybersecurity incorporating

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
cybersecurity into digital development

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
so when you start to look at the united

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,479
nations estimated that there's a funding

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
gap for building out these digital

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
infrastructures is more than one

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
trillion dollars a year

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
and today we're spending about 170

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
billion dollars on digital development

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
and um and

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
what was really interesting through the

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
course of our interviews and discussions

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
with so many

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
uh international institutions around the

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
world is that really better cooperation

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
and coordination is immediate needed

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,520
among these donor communities we need to

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
create trusted digital connectivity um

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
and uh and really get more power for our

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,199
dollars and our financing of these uh of

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
these projects in these developing

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,320
countries

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
and we really must address the fact that

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
digital development is and cyber

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
security are two sides of this of a coin

142
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
and they must be um incorporated and

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
will work together

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
when you look at the united nations

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
sustainable development goals and there

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
are 17 of them

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
that digitization can accelerate all of

148
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
those sustainable development goals and

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
the tools and the ict are important

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,199
tools for for enabling that we in the

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
report we identify that digital is part

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
of all 17 of the sustainable development

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
goals

154
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
and when you start to think about that

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
the digital technologies they um

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,080
they can optimize the use

157
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
for an inclusive digital economy for an

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
inclusive society to enable skills

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
development participation in the digital

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
economy

161
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,759
that were funding development of human

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
and institutional capacity and that's

163
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
really important that we actually

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
develop indigenous capacity in these

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,319
countries not just export the knowledge

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,639
from the northern hemisphere the western

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
hemisphere from the developed world into

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
the developing world that we have to

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,120
build

170
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
to indigenous capacity

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,600
that we need to think about online

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
rights as we do offline rights and that

173
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
human rights and human agency and how

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
the technologies are enabling

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
participation

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,199
in

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,919
society but also how the technologies

178
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
could hinder your participation in

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,360
society

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
this sdgs the sustainable development

181
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
goals talk about digital trust security

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
stability and um it's very clear that

183
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
these ict's misuse of icts can cause

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
mistrust can cause insecurity and

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,880
instability in countries and in

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
provinces or in towns and we have to

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
address those things

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,960
and then finally um fostering digital

189
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
cooperation we need more digital

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
cooperation as we're funding more and

191
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
more digital development and we need to

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
create these mentor protege

193
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,400
systems and this broader incorporation

194
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,039
of again the cyber security community

195
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,039
along with the digital development

196
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
community

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
and it's important to note that

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
secretary gutierrez for the last four or

199
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,280
five years un secretary general has been

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,639
talking about the dark side of

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,360
innovation the cyber security threats

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
and um and the misuse of icts that they

203
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,919
can become tools of cyber crime of

204
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
surveillance of uh

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,560
enabling disinformation

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,800
enabling espionage uh and exploitation

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,639
of data and even worse enabling digital

208
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,440
authoritarianism where it's actually

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
limiting our human rights online um as

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,960
we experience uh as we hope to have and

211
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,520
so we offline and we need to you know

212
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
really look at this technology and

213
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
safeguarding it and then understanding

214
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,240
the unintended consequences of the

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
misuse and again this is one of the

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
findings that came out um across the

217
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,199
board through the interviews is there's

218
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,560
so many people who think about the

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
technology of what it's bringing from a

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
good perspective the digital economy

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
digital literacy participation

222
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
of being connected to the internet and

223
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,400
there are not many people who are really

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
witting of all of the misuse of and the

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
downside or the negatives the negative

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
externalities of the misuse of the

227
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
information communication technologies

228
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
so the report identifies the pathways to

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
bridge these two communities to bring

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
that like really the power of both and

231
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
how do we extraordinarily bring capacity

232
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
to these countries and right now it

233
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
can't be capacity of just we export it

234
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
it's got it has to be that we build

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
capacity indigenous capacity on the

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
ground so it's sustainable on the ground

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
in these recipient countries

238
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
so the power of both

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
we in the report francesca and i did a

240
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
really good history lesson i think of

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,399
how did the development community grow

242
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,399
up and then how did the cyber security

243
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
community grow up and um in the

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
international development community it

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,240
spans both national so united states

246
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,279
united kingdom australia italy france

247
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
germany the national countries that are

248
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
giving uh bilateral aid and the

249
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
international development agencies are

250
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
multilateral development banks like the

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
european bank of reconstruction or the

252
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
world bank or the

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
um the asia infrastructure bank

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
and then also to the large philanthropic

255
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
foundations like the gates foundation or

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
the ford foundation these private

257
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
foundations they didn't start using the

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
term building capacity until the 1990s

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
and

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
and they really did not see that their

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,880
projects were digital until really the

262
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,640
last five years or so and so it's it was

263
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
an evolution and we're and we're hoping

264
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
to spark and accelerate the digital

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
development community understanding why

266
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
they need to de-risk their investments

267
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,959
on the other hand the cyber security

268
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,560
community

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
as you all know um through the the

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
classes that you're having with with uh

271
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,040
with dr spafford is and and at purdue is

272
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,959
that the cyber security community grew

273
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,640
up from really very different

274
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
disciplines whether it was law

275
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
enforcement of looking at forensic

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
analysis or it's the technical community

277
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,640
the computer emergency response teams

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
the areas that you're studying in

279
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
computer science or foreign policy

280
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,279
of thinking about rules of engagement

281
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
responsible state behavior or human

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
rights

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
and cyber capacity building emerged

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
in this policy discussion really just

285
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
recently in the last decade uh and um

286
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
and and some countries are starting to

287
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
include a more holistic view in their

288
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
national strategies but as as a

289
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
community the cyber security community

290
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
still really embraces

291
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
it from their individual disciplines not

292
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
as a holistic perspective and this was

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
one of the areas that we identified in

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
the report

295
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
is that we need to come as a cyber

296
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
security community come together more

297
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
broadly and open up our aperture on how

298
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
we're talking about digital risks

299
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
and and digital resilience

300
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
we identified the benefits of bridging

301
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,519
and you know so

302
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
why do we need to think about bringing

303
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
these two communities together well

304
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
first of all the decision makers whether

305
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
it's the decision makers at the banks

306
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,839
and the loan institutions they need to

307
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,440
understand that when they're fielding

308
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
and funding digital that it needs to be

309
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
de-risked and that there's problems with

310
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
the misuse of icts but we also need

311
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,720
decision-makers in the recipient

312
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
countries to understand that when they

313
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
get a loan to build a hospital or to

314
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,839
build an energy grid or to implement a

315
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,480
national identity system that they too

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
have to think about when and how could

317
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
these technologies be

318
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
misused and understanding that is

319
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
important for again getting sustainable

320
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,639
and more resilient outcomes

321
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
and then secondarily we looked at how do

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
you integrate cyber security into these

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
development programs from the beginning

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
of the project through the end in the

325
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
full life cycle of the project

326
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
and so that we can start to think about

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
better

328
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
processes eliminating duplication of

329
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
effort that you don't want to be fixing

330
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
something after the fact you want to

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,279
have thought through it at the very

332
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,600
beginning that how do you maximize the

333
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
resources and build again

334
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,279
stronger resilience safety security

335
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,440
trust into the technologies that are

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
going to be deployed to enable these key

337
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
critical services infrastructures

338
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
processes and procedures in these

339
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,760
countries

340
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
so these infrastructure investments

341
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
really need to consider digital

342
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,880
um that all of the every part of the 17

343
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,120
sustainable development goals and every

344
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
infrastructure build out has a digital

345
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
component and so the leaders who can

346
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
think about are more informed and

347
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,880
engaged and can ask the right questions

348
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
then they can start to think about risk

349
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
management so how will my national

350
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
identity system how could it be misused

351
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
how should i be protecting the data how

352
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
should i be transmitting the data how

353
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,959
should i store the data and things along

354
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,440
those lines from my energy grid um how

355
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
should i be thinking about its

356
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
resilience in the face of um an attack

357
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
or a malicious software or something

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
along those lines like we've seen in the

359
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,680
past against other

360
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
entities uh whether it be ukraine or

361
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,639
even here in the united states

362
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,079
and so we need to think about risk

363
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,000
management from the design again the

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
very beginning of the project discussion

365
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
through its implementation

366
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,880
and ensuring that we're going to

367
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
uh embed the right uh funding from each

368
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
of those levels whether it be in the

369
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
loan and financing or to into the

370
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
national budget of the recipient country

371
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,040
for the continuity of effort so

372
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
one of the key findings that we had is

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
that honestly we have to update the

374
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
playbook we the developed countries um

375
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
and uh are who are telling these

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
countries what we think they need to do

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,040
whether that is develop a cyber security

378
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
strategy implement a computer emergency

379
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
response team or a service

380
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
update their laws create an information

381
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
sharing regime

382
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
and the like that we really need to

383
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,199
start to think about

384
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
how do we up level the conversation

385
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
about cyber security and digital

386
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
resilience

387
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
into the country's real economic

388
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,639
aspirations what makes the country

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,519
strong

390
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,040
what is is is building their their gdp

391
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,639
what are their exports what are their

392
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
imports what are their key national

393
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,839
industries um and that all has to be up

394
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
leveled into their digital strategy into

395
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,920
their economic strategy and then the

396
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,079
development priorities of the recipient

397
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
countries the playbook of 20 years ago

398
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
of develop a cyber security strategy

399
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
update your laws are insufficient for

400
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,279
going forward over the next two 10 to 20

401
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
years we need to really think about how

402
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,519
we're going to

403
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,160
accelerate the digitization and do it

404
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,519
safely with trusted technology and that

405
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
requires us to really think about

406
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
de-risking our investments from the very

407
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
beginning both at the recipient country

408
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
and from the loan financing operations

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
that are coming from these multilateral

410
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
or private foundations um

411
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,040
so we need to think about the funding

412
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
for continuity and sustainment of the

413
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
project into the national budget and

414
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
unfortunately we're not really thinking

415
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
about those things so i have a five-year

416
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
loan or financing operation to build out

417
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
something that's digital and i'm not

418
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
considering the things that need to be

419
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
replaced at five or seven years hardware

420
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
software or the training that needs to

421
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
happen of my personnel or replacement of

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,399
personnel and so these things have to be

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
embedded again from start to finish to

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,959
get to the total cost of ownership and

425
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
sustainability

426
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
of these digital projects

427
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,519
second we need to be thinking about what

428
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
does the country need not what do we

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
think they should have but what do they

430
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
absolutely need

431
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
they need uh they need water they need

432
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,279
they need uh power they need uh a school

433
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,000
system or an update to their education

434
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
system they need the these different

435
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,519
capacities so uh we as we're looking at

436
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,079
these uh these development initiatives

437
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,079
we have to think about the need of the

438
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,040
country

439
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
not what we think they should have and

440
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,920
tailor it to the individual national

441
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
cultural circumstances uh what is

442
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,119
available there what is then has to be

443
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,599
also part of the of the funding

444
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
operations

445
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,679
i'm going to hand it over to uh

446
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
francesca now and she's going to talk

447
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
about some of the other findings in the

448
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
report francesca thank you melissa and

449
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
thank you professor stafford for having

450
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,199
me um so some of the other really

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
interesting findings as we

452
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
interviewed over 40 multilateral

453
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,240
development banks international national

454
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,679
development agencies and other

455
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
international organizations it's

456
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
certainly that there is an awareness of

457
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
the importance of cyber security and

458
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
digital capacity building and certainly

459
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,240
cyber security is becoming a growing

460
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
priority for all of those countries they

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,679
are seeking assistance

462
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
both for their economic development as

463
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
well as their security needs but one of

464
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,320
the most striking finding was that even

465
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
if there is this growing understanding

466
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,960
and we talk about cyber capacity

467
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,720
building digital capacity building there

468
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
is actually no common definition of what

469
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,600
these terms entails or what should be

470
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,919
included or who should be responsible

471
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,559
for capacity building efforts in fact of

472
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,880
all the organizations we interviewed

473
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
some define

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
as defined as building institution

475
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
computer emergency response team or

476
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,400
other competent authority at the

477
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
national level others as reforming the

478
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
legal system to better address cyber

479
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,600
crime others are developing very

480
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
specific technical operational capacity

481
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
um some others just talk about strictly

482
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
training programs but very few of those

483
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
organizations or donor countries

484
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
actually see capacity building as the

485
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
whole picture which involves

486
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
institutional governance legal technical

487
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
and operational capacity development

488
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
again a lot of those organizations we

489
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
interviewed use this term as overarching

490
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
term but then lay out different and

491
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
sometimes overlapping

492
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
cyber capacity building themes topics

493
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
pillars dimension or other activities

494
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,240
that they include in these buckets of

495
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
capacity and because we don't have a

496
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
common definition of what capacity

497
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
building is or how it should be

498
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
developed often we end up talking past

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
each other

500
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
next slide

501
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
another um finding is that cyber

502
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
security and digital resilience are not

503
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
yet seen as a strategic cross-cutting

504
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
issue and necessary components of

505
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
digital development in fact as we've

506
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
heard digital development community has

507
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,039
definitely embraced digital technology

508
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
and icds as a way to accelerate the

509
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
achievement of the united nations

510
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
sustainable development goals promoting

511
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
inclusion another of their overarching

512
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
goals and objectives but they still

513
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
consider cyber security as outside of

514
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,280
the development uh community development

515
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
goals and one of the problem is that

516
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
there is a way there is a problem with

517
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
the way we frame the narrative around

518
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,679
cyber security cyber security is still

519
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,000
generally perceived as a national

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,799
security issues as a national defense or

521
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,120
military problems as a law enforcement

522
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,840
issue or intelligence problem and this

523
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
perception often also means a cyber

524
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
security scene as best delivered by

525
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
professionals only in those specific

526
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
communities so what we argue in the

527
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
report is that in order to mainstream

528
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,760
cyber security and digital resilience

529
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,679
into the development thinking which

530
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,600
should refrain the cybersecurity

531
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
narrative in terms of digital resilience

532
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,600
safety trust sustainability risk

533
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
management rather than just security

534
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
um another uh problem or uh issue

535
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,799
related to this perception issue is the

536
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
fact that cyber security is not part of

537
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
the official development assistance

538
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
criteria established by the oecd for

539
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,080
those of you who are not familiar the

540
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,799
organization for economic uh cooperation

541
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,159
and development

542
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
that was established in the early 60s

543
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,799
developed this concept of official

544
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
development assistance to identify

545
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
specifically

546
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,880
the kind of funding that government

547
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
agencies would provide to developing

548
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
countries and to monitor lateral

549
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
development institutions to promote

550
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
economic growth and sustainability and

551
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
these sets of rules and criterias for

552
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
eligible funding is still today the gold

553
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
standard of foreign government

554
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,000
assistance and is still the main source

555
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,960
of financing for development aid today

556
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
but these criteria specifically exclude

557
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,679
for example military aid the promotion

558
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
of donor security interest

559
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,919
and cyber security is often perceived as

560
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,120
part of those

561
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
issues and therefore becomes often a

562
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,080
constraint for those donor countries

563
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
that want to fund cyber security

564
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
projects but they're not allowed to and

565
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
they have to either find different

566
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
pathways to fund those cybersecurity

567
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,960
efforts so they call them spatial items

568
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
of development as part of digital

569
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,520
transformation or reform to the legal

570
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,240
system or they have to fund them as

571
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,039
completely outside the scope of this uh

572
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,679
development assistance criteria so what

573
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
we are arguing in the report

574
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,679
is that the development assistance

575
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,840
committee of the oecd

576
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
should update this criteria just like

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
they update the list of countries that

578
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,760
are eligible for this type of

579
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
development funding and they should

580
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,200
include digital resilience to those

581
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,159
criteria for eligible assistance and as

582
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,679
part of their specific peace and

583
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,520
security activities and this would help

584
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
enable

585
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,799
those cyber security related assistance

586
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,120
and programs

587
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
next slide so again another of the

588
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,360
findings as we talk to all these

589
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
different organizations is that even

590
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
when we're able to fund cyber security

591
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
initiatives in cyber capacity building

592
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,159
or digital development projects that

593
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
have a cyber security component

594
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
unfortunately most donors implementers

595
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,880
and even the recipient countries as

596
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
melissa said before still see um

597
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
technology digital technology

598
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
information and communication

599
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
technologies as a long-term capital

600
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
asset as a one-time only expense instead

601
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
of commodities

602
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
and we all know that hardware and

603
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,360
software will need to be updated and

604
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
replaced at least every five to ten

605
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
years and if it's not

606
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,679
this will make those development program

607
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,000
or even cyber security capacity building

608
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,640
activities unsustainable um because the

609
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,000
technology will no longer be used safely

610
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,799
and many developed countries can't even

611
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,240
afford the long-term cost to sustain the

612
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
technology the institution the workforce

613
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
that they originally

614
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
started developed with the fund with the

615
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,240
funds that they received from developed

616
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
countries and multilateral development

617
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,559
banks so that's something that we all

618
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,919
need to address

619
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,279
by including the total cost of ownership

620
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,640
from ict support to system upgrades and

621
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
repairs and maintenance into the project

622
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
formulation it has to be programmed into

623
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,720
those assistance package and the

624
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
recipient country itself

625
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,480
must embed the ict commodity refresh

626
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,400
ict support upgrades workforce training

627
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,840
retention into its own national budget

628
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,640
so that it can be sustainable

629
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,039
now the rest of the reports as melissa

630
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,120
also briefly mentioned highlights the

631
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,919
benefits of incorporating cyber security

632
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,480
digital resilience in cyber capacity

633
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
building into the broader development

634
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
agenda and we also highlighted some not

635
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,760
worth the efforts to develop these

636
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,559
so-called digital public goods these are

637
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,640
universal tools and instruments they can

638
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
be shared repurposed and applied

639
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,039
globally

640
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,120
even the united nations wrote map for

641
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,200
digital cooperation that was published

642
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,080
in 2020 uh pushed for the creation of

643
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,480
these digital public goods as a way to

644
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
help support and also accelerate the

645
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
sustainable development goals and uh

646
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,559
secretary gutierrez even in september to

647
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,880
a new report called our common agenda

648
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
again encouraged

649
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,320
the fact that we need to improve digital

650
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
cooperation and create these digital

651
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
public goods

652
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,320
in the reports we highlight several um

653
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,760
of these tools programs project

654
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,159
there are available and they should be

655
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,880
used more broadly i'll mention a couple

656
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
but i encourage you again to read more

657
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
in our report and to go check out this

658
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
organization um crest for example this

659
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,279
institution in the uk has developed a

660
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,760
cyber security maturity model that is

661
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,320
freely accessible and affordable and can

662
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
help measure the maturity and the

663
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
financial inclusion of the cyber

664
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
ecosystem of a country so when you have

665
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,200
this type of assessment then you can

666
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,520
compare country sector organization you

667
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,679
can identify good practices

668
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
you can highlight gaps and better

669
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,520
address them

670
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,440
another important tool and that's where

671
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
you'll find our report is the global

672
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
forum on cyber expertise simple portal

673
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,799
which already captures many of these

674
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
digital public goods

675
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
but is also today the largest database

676
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
of existing cyber capacity building

677
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,080
projects methodology frameworks tools

678
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,799
other resources papers such as ours

679
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,520
and the gfc is also serving as a

680
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
clearinghouse

681
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
since this role

682
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,520
and helps better direct various requests

683
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
for support for cyber capacity building

684
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
and connect the requesting countries

685
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,080
with possible donors and implementers

686
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
another one that i absolutely recommend

687
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
to go check out is the

688
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,919
us iit cyber security primer which

689
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,360
really shows why and how to incorporate

690
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,600
cyber security and digital resilience

691
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,880
safeguards throughout an entire program

692
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
life cycle whether it's a development

693
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,840
project or cyber security specific

694
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
what all of these efforts have in common

695
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
anyway is that they can serve multiple

696
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,480
communities and they can be shared and

697
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,640
applied globally they can help start

698
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
bridging that development in cyber

699
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
capacity building thinking and mostly

700
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,159
they can help better fund um the

701
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,000
specific needs of a country and let

702
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,559
those funding be more focused and

703
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,760
based on a demand-driven

704
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
approach rather than a supply-driven

705
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
approach

706
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
other key recommendations throughout the

707
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,520
report that really emphasized the need

708
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,840
to cultivate the local cyber security

709
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,640
workforce to develop indigenous capacity

710
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,279
as melissa was saying earlier but doing

711
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
that requires addressing some of the

712
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
challenges first

713
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
such as affordability of cyber

714
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
certification again here i go back to

715
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
some of the digital public goods we

716
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,679
identified crest for example has been

717
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,520
doing a lot to provide affordable

718
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
professional level certification

719
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
accreditation career pathways for

720
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,039
individuals

721
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,600
we also need to develop better curricula

722
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,320
they're tailored to the specific country

723
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
um and they are developed with the

724
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,559
school and university in mind which is

725
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,000
for example something a japan

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
international cooperation agency has

727
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,480
been doing in partnership with local

728
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,240
universities

729
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
another challenges we need to address is

730
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
that again we need to identify and grow

731
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,559
local talent

732
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,440
and

733
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
develop uh programs that are suited for

734
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,360
the specific community country that

735
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,480
identify the risk and the challenges of

736
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,159
that country without

737
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,240
necessarily exporting our way of

738
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
thinking or our tools our knowledge and

739
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,480
our people

740
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,240
closely related to that is the need to

741
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,159
generate local buying of the local

742
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,039
leaders but in order to design more

743
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
tailored programs develop indigenous

744
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,760
capacity and generate that local buy-in

745
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
first we need to better understand the

746
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
local ecosystem the context the digital

747
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,559
risk to society and we can't do that if

748
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,799
we don't have local data trends

749
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,039
statistics field research one of the

750
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,880
thing we found is that even in

751
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,039
developing countries they're often still

752
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
using western sources and western

753
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,120
results of um to address cyber threats

754
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
and instead we need to have better local

755
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
data local statistics we need to engage

756
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
all the different local stakeholders

757
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,080
including government civil society and

758
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,799
academia so they can gather

759
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,000
data

760
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
they can analyze and this will help us

761
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,399
better develop those digital development

762
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,760
projects

763
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
they are tailored to those specific

764
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,080
needs of that recipient country and can

765
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
also help making a more compelling

766
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,039
argument as to why cyber security is

767
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,640
important to that country and that

768
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,039
community and this awfully will help

769
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,000
generate that local buy-in by framing

770
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,080
those activities in terms of economic

771
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,200
development digital resilience see

772
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,840
safety trust sustainability risk

773
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
management where we said that we need to

774
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
reframe the narrative of cyber security

775
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,960
and so in order to do all of this we

776
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
need to allocate fundings to the local

777
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,279
universities students researchers so

778
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,279
that they can gather the local evidence

779
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,080
they can conduct trend analysis in that

780
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,640
country or region and they can help

781
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,919
better characterize the threat within um

782
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,640
that again society community country or

783
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,120
region and we need to include the local

784
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
private sector which is a crucial

785
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,000
partner in developing again

786
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,480
a cyber security ecosystem in building

787
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
capacity um and he has a vetted interest

788
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
willing the economic and social societal

789
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
growth of that country um and last but

790
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,559
not least um go to the next slide we

791
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
need to help raise awareness and

792
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,919
increase practical collaboration between

793
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,679
the organization that already present in

794
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,399
the community uh and to do that we

795
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,840
should use local development

796
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,799
organization in civil society who might

797
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
have not prioritized cyber security

798
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
until now but they have a better

799
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
understanding of the local challenges

800
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,480
the connection

801
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
within the local community and they have

802
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,399
valuable relationship but also with the

803
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,440
local implementer so those organizations

804
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
can actually help raise the local

805
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,679
cybersecurity awareness they can help

806
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
build cybersecurity capacity and this

807
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
can be also a great opportunity for the

808
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
cybersecurity community and the

809
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,799
development community to work together

810
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,640
again the development community brings

811
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,440
that on the ground experience networks

812
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,919
uh relationship while the cyber security

813
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,399
capacity building community can bring

814
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
that extensive expertise awfully

815
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
together with local expert and local

816
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,799
buy-in

817
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,039
and develop successful programs so

818
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
melissa i'll pass it on to you but i

819
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
look forward to questions

820
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,600
so the the next part is is that when you

821
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,720
look at what's going on of the 170

822
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
billion dollars in digital development

823
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,159
projects

824
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,120
um there is what are as noted in the

825
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,039
development community there are darling

826
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,519
countries and then there are countries

827
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,039
um that are are not necessarily have

828
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,200
been prioritized for digital development

829
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
or for development at large the darling

830
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,440
countries um

831
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
are those where many banks or

832
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,440
international institutions are trying to

833
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
bring digital development

834
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
uh and um and so we identified that we

835
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,799
really have to avoid the duplication of

836
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,559
effort there needs to be much better

837
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,399
stronger coordination among the

838
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,519
developing

839
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,919
uh the development institutions of how

840
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,240
can they do a better handoff of i'm

841
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,399
going to start this project and then you

842
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,000
can do the next project and so that

843
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
we're getting more holistic development

844
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,519
and sustainable development in the

845
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
recipient countries and then focus on

846
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,799
broader approaches and solutions and

847
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,600
then if we de-duplicate our efforts then

848
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,519
in theory we should have more money

849
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
available for those countries that are

850
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
not receiving the development um

851
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,279
funding

852
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,720
or the orphans we did identify some

853
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
some really interesting best practices

854
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
for example in kenya where kenya had

855
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
received

856
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,799
the development of funding and had

857
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,200
developed some capacity and then had

858
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
developed enough capacity to start to be

859
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
a regional expert and pass on its

860
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,640
capacity and development into the

861
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,039
broader region and we look at that as

862
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,720
maybe a best practice or something that

863
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,559
could be replicated in other parts to

864
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
the world of the developing

865
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
the development loan and financing

866
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,200
helped one country and then that country

867
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,279
was able to help others

868
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,679
again that starts to get to optimizing

869
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,840
our resources for more resilient

870
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
outcomes

871
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
finally in the report we identified the

872
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,600
importance of networking the networks

873
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,840
during the course of this uh the all of

874
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
the different interviews and the

875
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
meetings that francesca and i had we

876
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,679
ended up actually already becoming the

877
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
bridge of connecting development

878
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,399
communities to development communities

879
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,559
developing and connecting some of the

880
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,320
digital public goods that nobody was

881
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,279
aware of to these communities and just

882
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,840
starting the conversation and making

883
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,519
those connections almost like the one

884
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,840
degree network of i'm going to connect

885
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
this person and then they become the

886
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
next connection and then the next

887
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,239
connection so we identified in the um

888
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,560
the very toward the end of the report

889
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,399
the venues for bringing this

890
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,918
international development community

891
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,520
together with the cyber security

892
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,639
community that doesn't normally happen

893
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,119
and how you can start to help spark that

894
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
conversation and build those

895
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,280
relationships on the margins of meetings

896
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
or and you know through the coffee

897
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,760
houses or on the ground in the recipient

898
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
countries so some bridging venues that

899
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,000
we identified

900
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,679
that we've already participated in the

901
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,679
global reform and cyber expertise had a

902
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,960
meeting with the organization of

903
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
american states and earlier in november

904
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
we had the launch of our report last

905
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,639
week

906
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
we're here today with you at purdue and

907
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
hopefully speaking to you many people

908
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
all around the world that you can be

909
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
part of this community and start to

910
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
communicate the importance of bridging

911
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,639
these communities there's the democracy

912
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,160
summit this week in the united states

913
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,280
there is uh the un is having a

914
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
conference with the least developed

915
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,800
countries in doha uh in january

916
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
indonesia assumes the presidency of the

917
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
g20 that's made digital development a

918
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,680
high priority which will be followed by

919
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,520
india's presidency of the g20 and 2023

920
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,920
and and we invite everybody to and help

921
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
us understand where are other bridging

922
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,160
venues that could happen

923
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,480
in any geography that it is because we

924
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,320
think this is so important that if we

925
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,720
bring these communities together we can

926
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,040
in fact see sustainable development

927
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,599
resilient development that's digitally

928
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,640
based so we invite your questions um

929

i noted in the chat that we put a link

949
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,280
to the report itself

950
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,119
on the page with the abstract and bios

951
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,400
and that will be available for anyone

952
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,839
who wants to

953
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,720
click through to look at it

954
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,720
so i'll i'll ask here

955
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,240
in in the interim while we're waiting to

956
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
see if somebody has a question

957
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,480
suppose

958
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,040
some of our students for instance

959
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
wanted to find a way to get directly

960
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,560
involved in this

961
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,520
we have a policy institute here we

962
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,680
involve some of our political science

963
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
faculty and

964
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,839
liberal arts students in the cyber

965
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,440
security program

966
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,320
so

967
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,839
do you have some

968
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,520
really specific

969
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,200
suggestions as to things that they can

970
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
do if they're interested in following up

971
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,800
on this

972
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
well i'll start and then i'll hand it

973
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,720
over to francesca i i think that one of

974
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
the most important things

975
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
especially is for students who are

976
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
working on a thesis or

977
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,119
or even undergrad students

978
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,440
um is when you go if you were to do a

979
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
study abroad or you were working in one

980
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,720
of these countries

981
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,760
um it's it's really understanding what

982
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,480
is going on there and collecting that

983
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,800
local data helping and working with the

984
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,520
students or in that community

985
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
of um

986
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,400
you know what's the level of crime and

987
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,760
fraud what is the primary use of ict in

988
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,359
in the country uh you know do most most

989
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
of the developing countries they don't

990
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,400
the people don't have computers they

991
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,079
have cell phones

992
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,240
how are they using that technology is it

993
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,480
for everything is it social media is it

994
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
for banking and finance is it for paying

995
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
for your groceries which is also the

996
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,560
true in most of the developing world and

997
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,720
then what if anything is happening from

998
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,480
a misuse of the ict i'm tracking um you

999
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,000
know there's a high degree of um

1000
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,440
of either child exploitation or bullying

1001
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
online which is at a different level

1002
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,960
than what we see here in the united

1003
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
states so being able to communicate that

1004
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
of here's some of the challenges of

1005
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,320
misuse of ict

1006
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,760
um even understanding just the the the

1007
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
the date

1008
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,599
um

1009
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,480
or the the version of what's the

1010
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,880
technology they're using um you know are

1011
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,240
they using windows 97 uh you know and or

1012
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,960
the you know not updated not updatable

1013
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
software is also really interesting

1014
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
because then you know they're 100

1015
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
vulnerable 100 percent of the time

1016
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,880
um and and those i think are really

1017
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
those are some really important things

1018
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,599
that i think

1019
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,000
from just a practical on the ground of

1020
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
under situation awareness and being able

1021
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,320
to communicate that back or document it

1022
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,560
in an academic way that can be used for

1023
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,359
decision makers francesca

1024
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,520
yeah and to follow up on that regardless

1025
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,040
of what the students are studying i

1026
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,960
would encourage them to understand the

1027
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,440
interconnection and interdependencies

1028
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
because one of the main issues we wrote

1029
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
this report is that we wanted to use the

1030
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,560
proper terminology the spoke in this

1031
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
case to the development community but

1032
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
students should understand the cyber

1033
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,520
risk to of increased digitization and

1034
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,839
whether they're focusing on policy

1035
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,960
governance institution computer science

1036
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,440
they need to learn how to make those

1037
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,359
connections so that one day when they

1038
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,359
are the ones talking to the policy

1039
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
makers to the national leaders to the

1040
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,920
head of a bank or a school or a hospital

1041
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
they know how to make these arguments in

1042
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
the terminology that speaks to that

1043
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,119
national leaders and so that takes time

1044
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,440
to refine that narrative to refine that

1045
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,520
language so one of our recommendations

1046
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
in the report was to reframe the

1047
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,599
narrative of cyber security in terms of

1048
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,000
trust resiliency digital

1049
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,839
because we're talking to the development

1050
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,280
community and we need to speak their

1051
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,240
language in order for them to embed

1052
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,920
cyber security and digital resilience in

1053
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,839
their program but no matter what your

1054
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,480
students are studying they will have to

1055
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,640
bring that cyber security that digital

1056
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,119
resilience into their organization into

1057
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,520
the field of study so learn how to

1058
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,240
reframe that narrative so that it speaks

1059
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
to the leaders that you will be

1060
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,319
informing and educating

1061
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,760
and you know

1062
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,440
build on that um

1063
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
is that you could even look at it here

1064
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
in the united states that we just passed

1065
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,240
a one trillion dollar bill back better

1066
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,440
infrastructure bill and it does not talk

1067
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
about digital resilience and security

1068
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
there's a whole separate line item of

1069
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,640
1.7 billion for cyber security to go to

1070
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,119
csa or to different agencies but it's

1071
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,359
not talking about integral that

1072
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,680
infrastructure development and fielding

1073
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,359
and the build back better has to be

1074
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,480
secure resilient safe and trusted and so

1075
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
we have the same problem here in the

1076
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,000
developed world that we need to blend

1077
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
these two communities and that requires

1078
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,200
people

1079
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,520
in your programs to be able to translate

1080
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
those things because we can't keep on

1081
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,920
making these same mistakes

1082
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,560
right and in fact we didn't even get in

1083
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,000
uh basic elements of incident reporting

1084
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,040
in in the ndaa uh because of

1085
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,000
quibbles

1086
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,119
um

1087
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,640
so i i

1088
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,880
i think this is really uh important

1089
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,640
point and one that we've tried to stress

1090
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,560
here in some of our classes

1091
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,359
is

1092
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,640
that

1093
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,520
our students generally are going to go

1094
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,960
into positions where they have to talk

1095
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
to people who don't have cyberis

1096
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
background i mean

1097
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,480
and it isn't even necessarily understood

1098
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,720
as as a priority they need to speak in

1099
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,839
terms of risk and cost benefit and

1100
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,640
safety and economic potential and so

1101
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,839
learning

1102
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,599
learning how to talk about those issues

1103
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,880
is really critically important

1104
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,920
i have

1105
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,319
something else i'll ask but i will defer

1106
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,839
here to the fact that we have somebody

1107
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,520
in the q a who

1108
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
uh has uh

1109
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,960
has a question so

1110
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,720
i'll let you answer that first and then

1111
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
if there's time i'll i'll pose my second

1112
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,800
question

1113
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,920
so do you

1114
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,200
uh do you have it there or would you

1115
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
like me to read it

1116
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,200
i can see it um it basically says uh in

1117
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,040
deciding which countries nations support

1118
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
or ally with regarding economic digital

1119
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,119
development many are the opinion that

1120
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,280
security is one of the primary

1121
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,960
determinant or value of such nations

1122
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,200
and

1123
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,119
is for and and then looking at the

1124
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,280
security building trust and trusted

1125
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,839
efforts so um if you go back to

1126
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,760
uh all of our countries

1127
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,160
and the oecd countries um from a

1128
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,240
bilateral perspective

1129
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,040
are

1130
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,720
from a digital development perspective

1131
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,200
are bound by the oecd

1132
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
requirements or criteria and so um each

1133
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,400
of our regions or each of our countries

1134
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,480
have different priorities based on our

1135
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,560
own economic interests but the

1136
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,520
development as right now precludes or

1137
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,920
excludes cyber security it's it's

1138
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,240
digital development and nation building

1139
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,599
or

1140
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,760
infrastructure building and along those

1141
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,440
lines so i'll just give you some

1142
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
perspectives from

1143
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,520
a europe perspective

1144
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,400
many of the european um one part of the

1145
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,040
european um investment infrastructures

1146
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,839
are all about eastern europe and um and

1147
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,560
making sure that those uh those

1148
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,920
countries are

1149
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,839
rece in the eastern neighborhood which

1150
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,240
would include ukraine and georgia and

1151
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,480
some of the the um

1152
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,440
uh

1153
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,560
uh like serbia montenegro etc that they

1154
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,319
actually get infrastructure build out

1155
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,480
that's important to europe for europe

1156
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,800
security interests but also for your

1157
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,640
economic interests

1158
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
whereas other countries um bilaterally

1159
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,680
uh like australia is looking at the in

1160
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,119
the asia-pacific realm um and uh for the

1161
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,079
united states uh we have a we're focused

1162
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:18,880
on

1163
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,480
uh various uh countries um

1164
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,640
for development canada is focused on

1165
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
organization of american states and

1166
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
south america so each of our countries

1167
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,480
are focused on different areas um we

1168
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,560
don't always coordinate which is why we

1169
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
have darlings and orphans

1170
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,880
but the the development criteria is

1171
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
really based on development it's not

1172
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
based on security but it absolutely has

1173
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,240
an economic intersection to it and in

1174
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
fact i would say that majority of our

1175
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,000
countries are thinking about this as an

1176
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,359
export strategy of export our talent

1177
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,640
our knowledge

1178
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,040
our people right our

1179
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,440
our industries and we have as a

1180
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,760
developed world have not focused enough

1181
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
on developing indigenous capacity in any

1182
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,400
of these countries from a security

1183
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,599
perspective

1184
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,960
we did it was not uh something that

1185
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,960
came out as a focal point just because

1186
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,720
of the from the development community

1187
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
and the oecd criteria that is actually

1188
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
excluded or precluded i'm not saying

1189
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
it's not done um but because i do

1190
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,440
observe that around the world from

1191
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,599
different um from different countries

1192
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,520
it's just not a focus of this report

1193
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,560
based on the oecd criteria

1194
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,480
fran do you have anything to add

1195
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
no that's absolutely correct and by the

1196
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,319
way keep in mind that only 38 countries

1197
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,440
are part of the oecd so the oecd despite

1198
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,520
establishing the criteria for

1199
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,480
development aid um it's made up of the

1200
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,839
38 most you know economically and

1201
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,760
technologically developed countries in

1202
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,640
the world um so i'm you know not trying

1203
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,599
to

1204
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,920
say anything against the usd having this

1205
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,200
role but this it's another reason why

1206
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,359
they should review and update those

1207
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,680
criteria and include and incorporate

1208
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
other real needs of those countries

1209
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,680
they're on the receiving end and not

1210
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,640
part of the oecd

1211
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,880
well that

1212
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,240
really sort of in part

1213
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
a little on what i was going to ask and

1214
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,200
that is that

1215
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,920
we

1216
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,599
speak of in many places a sort of

1217
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,680
digital divide

1218
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,040
between the haves the half star

1219
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,839
within populations and within countries

1220
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,400
and so part of the question they're uh

1221
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,000
pointing to africa but not limited to

1222
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
africa certainly other parts of the

1223
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,319
world

1224
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,760
we have exploited their resources

1225
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,240
of those countries

1226
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,319
by leveraging the fact that very often

1227
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,839
they don't have they need that they need

1228
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,440
the cash infusion

1229
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,599
they don't have the technical prowess

1230
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,240
locally to take advantage of it

1231
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,880
and it seems to me that some of what

1232
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,680
we would worry about as a security issue

1233
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,319
is that those countries

1234
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,079
could still be ripe for that kind of

1235
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,760
exploitation if they don't have the

1236
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,599
protections in place

1237
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,560
that

1238
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,359
we know of examples for instance where

1239
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,640
bids for

1240
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,359
extraction of minerals have been skewed

1241
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,240
by

1242
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,520
being viewed by some of the parties uh

1243
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,119
despite being

1244
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
supposed to be confidential until being

1245
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,880
opened officially um and

1246
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
certain amounts of corruption uh which

1247
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,720
were alluded to in the question as well

1248
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,119
that we know in many countries that the

1249
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,839
money has resulted in corruption of

1250
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,800
leadership um if we don't have the

1251
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,319
transparency

1252
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,480
and the security of some of the

1253
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,920
the computing that's being used for

1254
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,200
communication

1255
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
it may perpetuate that

1256
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,079
so

1257
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,960
um are these issues that you touched on

1258
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
in any depth or

1259
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,720
uh are these

1260
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,000
more

1261
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,480
secondary characteristics after some of

1262
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,599
the more pressing initial uh elements

1263
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,599
one quick point in addition to what you

1264
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,599
just said is that we did highlight in

1265
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,040
the report is that many of those

1266
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,680
developing countries are leap frogging

1267
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,440
in their use of technology and so

1268
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,800
because they're going so fast in their

1269
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,280
digitization process without necessarily

1270
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,880
taking the time to learn how to use

1271
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,160
those technology securely uh learn about

1272
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,640
cyber hygiene and awareness they're

1273
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,839
actually also becoming now a threat to

1274
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,400
developed countries because they now

1275
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,800
become the place from where a lot of the

1276
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,480
attacks are originating

1277
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,160
and it's because those countries are

1278
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,480
digitizing super fast they might be

1279
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,400
harboring some of the criminals because

1280
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,119
maybe they don't have the legal regime

1281
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,440
in place yet or they have all these

1282
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,520
vulnerable devices that they've adopted

1283
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,040
so fast you know in most developing

1284
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,240
countries they're doing their online

1285
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,760
banking from their phone but they don't

1286
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,839
necessarily secure their phone so that

1287
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,720
device can become part of a botnet or uh

1288
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,760
be the originator of other attacks so

1289
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,079
the developed world should pay even more

1290
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,800
attention because it can be actually in

1291
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,040
a worse place if we don't help those

1292
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,520
countries learn about cyber security and

1293
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,880
resilience as they continue very fast to

1294
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,559
digitize and take advantage of

1295
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,800
digital technology to advance their

1296
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,599
growth and their um you know societal

1297
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,720
development

1298
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,880
and i would just add to one last point

1299
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,720
to everything i agree with everything

1300
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,280
that francesca said and one other point

1301
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,400
is that one of the things that we

1302
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,960
discovered in doing this research

1303
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,920
is is that when we do an infusion of

1304
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,599
capital into these any of these

1305
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
development countries and we start to

1306
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
develop that talent

1307
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,760
that talent may go into industry and do

1308
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,920
things that are great but they may also

1309
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,319
also go into criminal syndicates and

1310
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,160
actually start to conduct the crime and

1311
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,400
fraud now knowing what could be done

1312
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,920
with the skill sets that we have

1313
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,079
actually transferred to them and so

1314
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,960
there are many challenges going forward

1315
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,000
um and that have to be addressed but

1316
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,839
aligning the digital development

1317
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,839
community or and

1318
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,079
it with the cyber security community can

1319
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,640
only lead to good things versus

1320
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,240
continuing to perpetuate basically cyber

1321
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,720
insecurity by not de-risking or not

1322
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,200
embedding the resilient safety trust

1323
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,720
into these loans and financing

1324
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,240
operations

1325
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,920
yeah that sort of echoes what happens

1326
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,079
back in the 80s when uh

1327
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,640
the soviet union fell and we had all

1328
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
these talented programmers

1329
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,119
who couldn't make a living uh in their

1330
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,000
country bulgaria notably was one and

1331
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,440
they started writing a lot of computer

1332
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,079
viruses and various kinds of

1333
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,720
theft wear at the time

1334
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,119
as you remember i know we discussed that

1335
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,480
in the past

1336
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
uh there's another question in the

1337
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
question in the q a if you care to

1338
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
address

1339
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,160
sure i think briefly we follow the money

1340
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,440
the majority of the money for

1341
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,720
development projects still comes from um

1342
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,119
countries donor countries

1343
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,520
national and international development

1344
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,079
organization and because the task was to

1345
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,520
understand how to bridge these two

1346
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,760
communities the majority of the

1347
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,160
organization um we interviewed were

1348
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,000
multilateral development banks and were

1349
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,880
donor countries but we do talk about

1350
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,240
civil society um local organization as

1351
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,400
part of our recommendation how to better

1352
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,800
connect with the local community and

1353
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,280
also we interviewed pretty much every un

1354
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,079
agency and body that deals with either

1355
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,720
cyber security or development um and

1356
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
obviously those agency embodies do work

1357
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,680
also with local ngos and other

1358
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,079
independent um you know civil society

1359
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,240
organization so they were certainly part

1360
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,000
of the report today are part of our

1361
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
recommendations but again we follow the

1362
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,200
money

1363
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,520
we followed the money and if for anybody

1364
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,960
who wants to learn about any of these

1365
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,720
institutions we have an annex that

1366
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,559
highlights all of what their

1367
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,119
capabilities are what they're focused on

1368
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,559
some of the digital public goods that

1369
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,200
they have um that they have prepared and

1370
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,839
so it's a it's a it's a good primer for

1371
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,760
anybody in international relations or

1372
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,520
international development if you want to

1373
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,359
understand internationally what's going

1374
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,040
on in this space read the annex

1375
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,960
great thank you

1376
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,680
um we have time if people have

1377
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,520
one or another question and uh

1378
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,760
we're getting some good answers here as

1379
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,280
well as there's a lot of material in the

1380
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,800
report that is well worth reading

1381
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,640
tremendous amount of effort went into it

1382
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,680
and i hope

1383
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,520
i hope it's heated by some of the people

1384
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,160
the decision makers rather than just

1385
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,280
another

1386
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,800
great we've addressed it and that's it

1387
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,559
which is the way a lot of cyber security

1388
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,640
is handled as you know is we've got a

1389
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,040
report it's taken care of

1390
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,040
yeah i think we've gotten some very

1391
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,200
positive feedback from

1392
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,079
um

1393
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,520
uh from some of the institutions that um

1394
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,119
inter-american development banks said

1395
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,800
this is really important because they're

1396
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,040
working on their digital a digital

1397
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,880
strategy and how they build resilience

1398
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,480
into their loans and financing

1399
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,000
operations the same for the asia

1400
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,720
infrastructure bank um that's funding a

1401
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,359
lot of the belt and road initiative uh

1402
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,880
areas that this was something that's

1403
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,400
transformational to them because they

1404
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
had not thought about

1405
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,400
the cyber security or the misuse of ict

1406
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,000
so it was going to fundamentally change

1407
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,680
the way they were thinking about project

1408
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,200
development from inception to execution

1409
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,400
um

1410
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,880
and then i think that just the fact that

1411
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,079
we've got some of the development

1412
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,680
community speaking to the development

1413
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,880
community and and was got the usaid's

1414
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,200
primer into the development community

1415
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
and circulated it among everybody or

1416
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,920
introduced everybody to crest as a as a

1417
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,319
as a platform to either do a risk

1418
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,720
assessment or a platform to understand

1419
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,480
what were some of the companies in each

1420
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,559
region that could actually be execution

1421
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,119
arms for the the loans and bring that

1422
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,079
expertise so i think we've already made

1423
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,400
a like a a difference i think i'm

1424
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,240
looking forward to

1425
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,240
events like this that could get more

1426
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,319
awareness of what of what the report

1427
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,559
entails and get the c and just spark the

1428
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,559
conversation i think that the most

1429
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,839
important thing is once you get the

1430
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,680
conversation going then you could start

1431
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,079
to get to action and then um and then

1432
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,400
again more resilient outcomes is the

1433
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
desire

1434
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,280
and professor sparkford maybe here's

1435
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,040
another recommendation for your student

1436
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,200
as they start doing their own research

1437
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,040
or they join a think tank or research

1438
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,720
institute if they're able to make those

1439
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,800
connections before they start a report

1440
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,559
and so that they have a champion whether

1441
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,480
it's an international organization or a

1442
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,000
country then there is a better chance

1443
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,920
that once the report is published

1444
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
somebody's taking on this recommendation

1445
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,280
and trying to actually use them and

1446
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
implement them so i think i'm confident

1447
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
about the result of our report because

1448
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,520
the organizational commission that

1449
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,079
really wanted it and they seem so far

1450
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,920
committed to champion this

1451
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,839
recommendation and take them forward

1452
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,440
whether it's with the oecd or with other

1453
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,240
organization so we all we need more

1454
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,240
research in this field but it can be

1455
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,079
just research for the sake of writing

1456
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,319
another pretty paper it has to be

1457
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,240
connected to specific outcomes and again

1458
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,599
if you already have that champion

1459
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,200
because the your think tank your

1460
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
research institute is responding to a

1461
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,400
grant or is being commissioned by

1462
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,640
the world bank or you and body or others

1463
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,839
and there is a better chance that the

1464
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,839
recommendations they come up with are

1465
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,400
taken on by that organization of that

1466
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
country

1467
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,400
oh that's great i that that is reason to

1468
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,640
hope and in fact as you were both

1469
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,799
speaking i was thinking wouldn't it be

1470
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,799
wonderful if not only was some of this

1471
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,440
adopted to help guide many countries in

1472
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,720
their development

1473
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,040
but if as a result that applied some

1474
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,200
back pressure on the more developed

1475
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,319
countries

1476
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,319
to actually improve some of

1477
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,559
the infrastructure that we have in place

1478
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,799
where we have failed to put in some of

1479
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,480
the safeguards

1480
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,040
that we know how to do but we just have

1481
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,319
been

1482
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,559
moving quick forward so quickly we

1483
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,319
haven't done it if if

1484
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,680
some of the more developing countries

1485
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,599
leapfrog us there

1486
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,119
maybe that will be a good example for

1487
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,440
the rest of us

1488
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,319
so

1489
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,200
yes

1490
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,359
well i don't see any other questions

1491
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,440
this has been delightful i i want to

1492
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,200
