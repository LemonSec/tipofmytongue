00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
affiliated with you with both ucl and cu

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
boulder but currently i'm based in

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
warsaw poland you know i used to work

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
for a long time at the university of

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,120
warsaw law school and now i like quite

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
recently i moved to the technical

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
university of warsaw cyber security

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
uh department but you know my

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
presentation today will be based on like

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
it would be like a two-fold um approach

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
so uh in the first half of that in the

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
first part of that i would talk about

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
the so-called future crimes

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
uh landscape about the emerging

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
technologies or or technologies that are

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
available but and are in one way or

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
another or could be in one way or

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
another used or abused by criminals or

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,239
terrorists

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,480
and and in the second half of that

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
presentation i would focus primarily on

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
that infodemics and

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,640
dimension that joel introduced the

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
disinformation misinformation

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
problems that we are dealing with um

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
with now so just just a word of warning

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
you know i'm not a technical person also

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,159
i'm not an i.t or computer science

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,360
uh

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
specialist so i work in the area called

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
the crime science which is like the um

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
it's not criminology it's not forensic

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
science it's it's more of a

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
tarot and cross-disciplinary analysis of

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,439
different types of criminal or terrorist

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,399
problems that we are experiencing

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,040
and based on the empirical research

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
trying to

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
design

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
uh the verifiable methods or measures to

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,960
counter them or mitigate their

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
consequences so i come from more from a

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
social science side and i know that

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
probably uh most of you here

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
in the room are are on the are more on

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
the technical side so my

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,400
understanding is that you know some or

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
most of the problems that i'm going to

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
to cover today

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
are not are nothing new to you but but

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
hopefully or perhaps the

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
the landscape of that problem uh would

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
be would be interesting and one thing

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
that i i really want to start with is

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that i've collaborated with various

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,479
police forces and intelligence agencies

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
worldwide for quite a long time

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,360
and you would be surprised how often

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
it is that people who are in charge of

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
law enforcement for example are not

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
aware or are not fully you know able to

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
comprehend the scale of the problems

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
that their forces might be

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
dealing with so i will try to to give

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
you like a scenario based or

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
problem-based analysis of the of the

145
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
cyber-enabled

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
crimes and then i will move forward to

147
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,680
the

148
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,120
disinformational misinformation domain

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
that i focused my research for the last

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
couple of years

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
uh on so anyway without further ado you

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
know for the purpose of my work i tend

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
to call the

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
internet and related computer

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
information technologies to be

156
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,319
kind of a

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
modern battlefield where we've got two

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
competing sites you know we've got law

159
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
enforcement on the one side and

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
criminals or terrorists or offenders on

161
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
the other

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,639
and they use the available technologies

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
in their as they call it fight for for

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
uh for domination

165
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,039
and and why is that you know it's uh

166
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
it's fairly easy to to to understand

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,319
that why why it happens because it's a

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,440
you know i

169
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,080
i i tend to compare the those

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
technologies to a like a swiss army

171
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
knife so we've got a multi-purpose tool

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,600
that is

173
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
easy to access easy to master it's

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
either really inexpensive for or free

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
allows you to operate on a larger scale

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
while being you know geopolitical border

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
agnostic and if you know what you're

178
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,240
doing you can maintain highly serious

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,880
degree of anonymity and remote your

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
actions

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
remotely so it would be utterly stupid

182
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
not to use a tool like that so

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
as it happens with you know majority of

184
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
technologies that are intercepted so to

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
speak by the by the criminals you know

186
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,199
the original

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,840
idea behind them was not to create a

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
tool for a terrorist or a criminal

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
offender but sooner or later as with

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
everything like with a hammer or a knife

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
somebody will find out that it can be

192
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,720
applied for less benign

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,479
objectives or or

194
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,199
or

195
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
reasons

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
uh and other thing and this is something

197
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
that is really really

198
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
important is that we are we've been

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
undergoing you know forever degeneration

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
of generational changes and all the time

201
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
we've got new generations of potential

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
offenders entering let's call it the you

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
know criminal market and especially

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,400
today when we've got the

205
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,840
the cohort or regeneration of the

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,720
so-called aptly named digital natives we

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
we're dealing like i'm saying we

208
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
you know from the point of view

209
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
of the law enforcement or intelligence

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
agencies we're dealing with the people

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
who are

212
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,759
almost born online who are skilled in

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,639
that

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,440
uh

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,919
and uh for for whom do you know the

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
those technologies are uh are are kind

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
of a natural environment and the the

218
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
problem from the point of view of law

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
enforcement is that

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
people who work in that field

221
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,039
are

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,240
usually

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
older they are less

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,279
skilled in that they have other duties

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,958
they have plenty of paperwork and

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
bureaucracy and in majority of the

227
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
countries the

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,360
the

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
government side cannot compete with the

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
private sector for the best and

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
brightest experts in computer

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
rit

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
security so you know i'm quite

234
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
pessimistic in terms of you know

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
my hope for that struggle or that

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
battlefields to uh

237
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
to be you know to be on our side that

238
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,959
that we would be able to like to the

239
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
windows that struggle

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
so it's more of an uh of an analysis of

241
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,040
how to prevent or rather mitigate the

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
consequences of the abuse of of the

243
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
technology what we've been seeing in the

244
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,519
last you know 20 years is that there is

245
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,320
a

246
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,519
very direct shift in trends on how

247
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
criminals or terrorists

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,399
are using the available technology for

249
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,240
their objectives

250
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
so most often they use these

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
technologies for those planning and

252
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,240
preparation stages but more and more

253
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
clearly

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
we can see that they also use it for the

255
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
execution of the crime and by the way

256
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,240
i'm not talking about cyber crime in the

257
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
traditional sense of the word it's about

258
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
something that's happening online or in

259
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
the online environment

260
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
i'm rather say i'm rather talking about

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
the creative

262
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
calibration or abuse of the technology

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,640
to execute or to commit crimes

264
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
in real life circumstances so i'm i'm

265
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
rather talking about the so-called

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,839
cyber-enabled crime so we can say that

267
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,320
they are if what you see on the slide

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
here those bullet points if they

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
describe or illustrate some kind of like

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,640
a criminal way from planning

271
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
true exit preparation and execution up

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,360
to you know destroying evidence

273
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,399
and

274
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
more and more often

275
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
we can see examples of the

276
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
or case case studies or cases

277
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
where the where the offenders are are

278
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,839
abusing the the technology that's

279
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
available to them at all of those

280
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
stages

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,600
so are we really talking about you know

282
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
future

283
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,480
uh

284
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
crimes you know some some of the things

285
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
that i'm going to describe today have

286
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,760
already happened some of them are beyond

287
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,839
the proof of concept and some of them

288
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,480
might sound a little bit sci-fi

289
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
but uh

290
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
you know according to the the to the

291
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
analysis performed by you know my

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
colleagues in the field they are very

293
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
very likely to

294
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
to happen so those cyber enabled actions

295
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,680
can be utilized at different

296
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
layers or levels of criminal behavior

297
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
from like regular street level crime to

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
organized crime

299
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
through terrorism up to the nation state

300
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
or information cyber warfare scenarios

301
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
so i'm going to cover them fairly

302
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
quickly i i know that we you know our

303
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
time today is limited

304
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
uh so i will try to to

305
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,240
as much as possible before heading to

306
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,440
the disinformation misinformation issues

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,279
so the thing that i would like to start

308
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
with are the

309
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,079
attacks based on the preparation where

310
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,480
the so-called open source intelligence

311
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
is

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
is used and of course

313
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,959
criminals or terrorists don't

314
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,079
necessarily have to even know that what

315
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,560
they're doing is called the open source

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,839
intelligence

317
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
in the law enforcement field but they

318
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
are still

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
doing that so they

320
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
they are not stupid you know they they

321
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,040
they uh you know the although uh

322
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
you know violent crime

323
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,760
tends to be spontaneous other forms of

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
crime are not and and the criminals

325
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
according to various criminological

326
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,639
theories uh do some kind of uh

327
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,519
of a risk analysis so they select their

328
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
victims or targets of their attacks they

329
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
assess if they are so-called higher or

330
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,639
low

331
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,959
risk targets you know from data points

332
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
of view if it's risky to attack them or

333
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,360
it's if it's risky to

334
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,160
to

335
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
select a specific person

336
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,600
to uh to rob kill or whatever is the the

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
criminal's uh objective so they do that

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
kind of an uh of an

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
analysis

340
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
uh beforehand

341
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,839
and with the technology available to

342
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,639
them they can do that

343
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
remotely so

344
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
there is a substantial evidence to to

345
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
confirm that in the

346
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
increasing number of crimes

347
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
the target selection or victim

348
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
monitoring is performed using the

349
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
social media or other technologies that

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,680
enable the criminals to assess the

351
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,959
potential

352
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
uh validity of the target selection uh

353
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
remote so they can learn a lot about you

354
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
know the

355
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
the geographic location

356
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,040
that they uh want to target or about a

357
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
specific person about their lifestyle or

358
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
or income or or what would be the best

359
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
way to approach them and so on

360
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
so from the point of view of the

361
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,160
criminal offender the

362
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
the beauty of of the technology

363
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
available to them

364
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,240
is that they can

365
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
exercise the majority of that

366
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
preparation

367
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
uh

368
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,079
remotely without endangering themselves

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,199
without being seen or without raising

370
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
the you know suspicion of potential

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
uh witnesses until the very very final

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,399
stage of the of the execution

373
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,199
uh of the uh of the crime and the remote

374
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
reconnaissance of attack location is

375
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
something that's

376
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
more and more frequently used also in

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,720
the

378
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,680
uh

379
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
terrorist scenarios for example in the

380
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
now it was years ago but but still you

381
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
know during the

382
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
uh lakshya shabirah terrorist

383
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
organization attacks in mumbai in india

384
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
about according to the india uh indian

385
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
police and intelligence about 95 percent

386
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
of the preparations uh uh for that

387
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
attack scene for for those attacks in

388
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
mumbai

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
uh were uh were prepared and and

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,240
executed uh remotely until the very very

391
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
final stage of sending the operatives to

392
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
mumbai and committing those horrible

393
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
uh attacks you know this slide what i'm

394
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
showing here it it goes slightly

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
beyond the the notion of the open source

396
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,800
intelligence but this is just an

397
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
illustration of the sources that you can

398
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
find online so what you can see here on

399
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
this slide

400
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,639
are the uh

401
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
are the photographs they can taken down

402
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
from uh from the instagram

403
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
uh that will that you could easily find

404
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,199
using one of the uh one of the freely

405
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,720
available tools

406
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
that uh

407
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,399
that can run through instagram for

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,360
looking for specific hashtags so those

409
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,320
are the

410
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
various types of polish documents

411
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
passports ids drivers licenses

412
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
speeding tickets uh credit cards and so

413
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,759
on

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
that people

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,839
it to instagram and hashtag them with

416
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,000
specific names like for example hashtag

417
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,959
password or hashtag drivers license and

418
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,759
so on this all comes from poland those

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,720
black and r uh art parts

420
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
were of course not blackened out by the

421
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,839
people who posted

422
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
that by but by one of the polish

423
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,959
cyber security companies that use those

424
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,959
photos to illustrate the the problem

425
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
that we are dealing with so you can find

426
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,279
online

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,399
highly

428
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,759
uh

429
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
like

430
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
specific personal information

431
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
without any

432
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
uh

433
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
without any problem and you know all of

434
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,079
those documents that you can see on the

435
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
slide come from from poland but you can

436
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,199
do searches like that in whatever

437

country you are you are interested and

438
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
i'm pretty sure that you will find quite

439
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,240
a lot of uh of documents and and very

440
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
personal and and delicate information

441
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
uh like that

442
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
uh one of the like extra layers of open

443
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
source intelligence is the is dragging

444
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,199
the information from various types of

445
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,079
words that if you use them correctly or

446
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
if you look for that information

447
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,839
on different types of of websites like

448
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
strava and domondo or mapmyran if we're

449
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
talking about sports devices or sports

450
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,559
trackers you can make a very

451
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,400
precise spatial temporal portrait or a

452
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,439
portfolio of a person that you are

453
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,559
interested in if that person is your

454
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,400
potential uh

455
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,679
target so it can be and and and has been

456
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
abused by the criminals who were

457
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,559
remotely tracking the whereabouts of

458
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
their potential victim

459
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,440
uh one of the cases that i'm pretty sure

460
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,200
most of you is are familiar with is the

461
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
strava

462
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
uh

463
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
disclosure of of the

464
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
u.s military bases uh abroad where where

465
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
u.s military personnel was using the

466
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,679
strava app

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,600
to uh to track their daily their you

468
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,400
know

469
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
uh

470
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,559
workouts uh and and we're uploading that

471
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,200
to the uh to open source

472
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,960
uh platforms uh were you know if you if

473
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
you looked for the for the strava

474
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,559
geotags online you could find them in

475
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,039
really strange geographic locations

476
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
and if you

477
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,280
cross compare that information with the

478
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
you know with the satellite imagery you

479
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
could find the locations of american

480
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,799
bases in countries like uh like

481
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
afghanistan or iraq or or

482
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
or in some one instance in

483
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,679
yemen

484
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,679
an interesting thing that uh that is uh

485
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
you know showing up on the criminal

486
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
market is the abuse of the information

487
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,720
coming from pet wearables this is this

488
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
might sound you know and seem to be

489
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,240
really funny or or crazy but there were

490
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
already

491
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,919
instances where the geo

492
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,679
information or special temporal

493
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,960
information

494
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,640
of a of a pet was used by the criminal

495
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
to

496
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
create a more tarot portfolio or a

497
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
description of the owner's whereabouts

498
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,000
and quite recently about five months ago

499
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,559
there was a an interesting case criminal

500
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,960
case in in in poland where i'm where i'm

501
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
based uh now or one of those dark colors

502
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
that had

503
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
had an option of of a micro of of uh

504
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
remote activation of the of the

505
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,799
microphone

506
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
and on a camera that was included in the

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
in that doc tracker

508
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,120
and they and and was not password

509
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
protected allowed the criminals to to

510
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,240
check out the surroundings of the

511
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,880
uh of the location where the dog uh

512
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,840
lived so the

513
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,760
the robbers people who were responsible

514
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
for the breaking entry to that to that

515
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,480
place

516
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
uh could could see the surroundings of

517
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
the pet

518
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,880
they they knew that the owners were not

519
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,919
in the house and they could fairly well

520
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,400
guess that the there were there were no

521
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
alarm systems activated in the house

522
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,720
because the dog was roaming freely

523
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,760
inside the house so they just made that

524
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
assumption that that that the place is

525
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,280
not secured with any kind of an

526
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
electronic surveillance or or monitoring

527
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,159
like alarm monitoring and they committed

528
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
that that crime it turned out later much

529
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
later during when they were arrested for

530
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
for you know based on other evidence

531
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,200
that they used that technology to

532
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
to scan the the surroundings of the of

533
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,880
their attack

534
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,919
uh

535
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,120
location

536
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,600
moving forward what what that technology

537
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
can and social media information and

538
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
open source intelligence could be used

539
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
uh for so for example one of the areas

540
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
that i focused my work a couple of years

541
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
back when i was a member of a

542
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
big research project that dealt with the

543
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,559
loan act or terrorism

544
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,400
and violent extremism

545
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,919
was that um quite often especially in

546
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
the last 10 years

547
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,280
or so we could see that being

548
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
social media information open source

549
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,000
information was used by terrorist

550
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
organization

551
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,799
to groom

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
and first of all you know profile and

553
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
select and then to ground potential

554
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
activists or or extremists it can be

555
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,880
used for other

556
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
uh reasons like that are listed here

557
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
like victims of human trafficking or

558
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,440
potential victims of sexual abuse but

559
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
from the point of view of the research

560
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
group that i worked with

561
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,000
for for quite a long time using that to

562
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,840
groom potential extremis extremists is

563
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,679
really really interesting and one of the

564
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,480
cases that i want to raise to illustrate

565
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
that are the boston marathon bombers the

566
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
tsarnaev brothers johar and tamrill and

567
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,039
tsarnaev

568
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
uh who came from cheshire and they lived

569
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200
in the in the united states for quite a

570
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
long time

571
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
and they did not have any contact with

572
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
terrorist organizations like a direct

573
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
contact whatsoever

574
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,320
but the other brother was uh

575
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
that's that's one

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
uh was was groaned online and

577
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,480
brainwashed online and prepared for that

578
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,120
uh horrible massacre that he and his

579
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,679
younger brother were responsible for

580
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,480
and he did not have at any stage any

581
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
direct links or personal face-to-face

582
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
contact

583
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
with any operatives of terrorist

584
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
organization all of that

585
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,440
preparation was performed fully

586
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
fully online and tamarlan and dzhokhar

587
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
especially tamrolan

588
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
were were selected and groomed

589
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,320
based on their on their online

590
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
activity

591
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
uh okay moving forward because i know

592
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
that we will run out of time very soon

593
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
and i don't want to keep you after the

594
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
classes is over you know like another

595
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
like if you're connecting the dots what

596
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,799
is that landscape of the technology

597
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,559
available to the

598
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,000
uh to the to the offenders 3d printing

599
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,799
you know i i'm pretty sure that you know

600
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,799
quite a lot about that

601
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
so you know 3d printing of weapons is a

602
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
was a hot topic you know a couple of

603
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,240
years ago but what's more important

604
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
today especially with the iot internet

605
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,760
of things uh layer that i will

606
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
discuss briefly in a moment

607
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
is that that technology can be also

608
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,640
abused by the by the malign actors to

609
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,280
interfere with the legitimate printing

610
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,919
that when they can hack the hack the

611
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,799
legitimate printing algorithms and

612
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
inject the malicious code that could for

613
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
example

614
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,799
cause the delay delayed destruction

615
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,760
of the

616
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
of the printed um

617
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
item

618
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
another layer are the attacks on the iot

619
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
uh first about you know i want to talk

620
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
about the specific devices

621
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
so

622
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,760
it can be

623
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,559
like analyzed in in like a two-fold

624
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,919
fashion first of all the devices the iot

625
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
devices themselves

626
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,120
can be used as an extra layer of that

627
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,520
open source intelligence domain that

628
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,840
i've spoken about a couple

629
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,960
so excuse me a couple of minutes ago so

630
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
information coming from those devices

631
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,880
can allow or enable the the offenders to

632
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,919
create an even more thorough portrait or

633
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,520
a portfolio

634
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,480
on their potential victim be it a person

635
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
or be it

636
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
a location or a some kind of an entity

637
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
you know like that middle screen

638
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
middle photograph shows the like one of

639
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,559
the ads for the olb

640
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,039
electric toothbrush that was that had

641
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,360
the bluetooth connectivity

642
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,480
and and the the the individual brushes

643
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
for family members had their own

644
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
microchip so that would allow them to

645
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
upload the information from the

646
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,760
toothbrush to a designated app and to

647
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
share it online

648
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,080
which was in theory designed to

649
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,600
say

650
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
allow parents to to control you know

651
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,720
their you know tooth brushing activities

652
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,200
and their kids but when that information

653
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,799
was uploaded

654
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
to the social media and it happened you

655
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,159
know

656
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,919
several times because this is what the

657
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,600
app was all about

658
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,320
uh it it gives like in terms of the open

659
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,039
source intelligence it gives the person

660
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,279
who is interested in a specific victim

661
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,240
or a specific target like another layer

662
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,279
of that spatial temporal analysis of a

663
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,400
specific person's

664
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,360
you know

665
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,039
daily

666
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,320
daily

667
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,600
behavior

668
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
so

669
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,799
individual

670
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,919
iot devices can also be

671
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
the targets or they can be they can act

672
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,080
as a as a backdoor for the preparation

673
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,559
of another type of a crime you can see

674
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
the the mattel

675
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,039
uh iot barbie doll uh which

676
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
which was designed to work as a baby

677
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,080
monitor

678
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
but because as as always you know the

679
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
security protocols and password

680
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,200
protection was very very long on those

681
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,559
devices

682
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,159
it could also be

683
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,960
uh abused and used as a as a

684
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,279
surveillance kind of uh

685
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,679
of a device but those are the the

686
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
attacks on the individual

687
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,279
items or or devices another layer of of

688
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,320
the problem for cyber-enabled crime

689
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
are the attacks on the whole networks of

690
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
the iot

691
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
devices so if and when they are executed

692
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
correctly

693
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,440
or deliberately by a probably but not by

694
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
a like your street level type of a

695
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
criminal but but either by nation states

696
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
or terrorist organization or even

697
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
organized crime they can create a mass

698
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
level disruption

699
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
on a very large uh

700
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,120
area causing like for example power grid

701
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,000
uh overload or they could be used to

702
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
attack on the

703
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
entities or agencies or or industries

704
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,720
that form the the whole

705
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
scheme of the critical national

706
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,039
uh infrastructure

707
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,480
and if the

708
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,399
um

709
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,480
whoever is behind such an attack if they

710
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,520
are able to penetrate or infiltrate the

711
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,880
iot

712
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,679
uh

713
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,799
network

714
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
they could either you know knock it down

715
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
or overload it

716
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
or or drag or or gather

717
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,760
information from from from those devices

718
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,480
as a network on a very very large

719
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
um

720
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
scale

721
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,520
another layer are the attacks also in

722
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,159
the iot uh domain on the i uh on the ips

723
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,480
enabled medical devices

724
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,919
such as space makers or

725
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,240
cardioverters or the insulin pumps

726
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
uh another problem that's associated

727
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,679
with that

728
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,720
is not only the attacks on on those

729
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
devices that the that it's

730
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
potentially possible to interfere

731
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,320
we will say the frequencies or the uh

732
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
or the algorithms that that that control

733
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
those devices

734
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
but another problem with those attacks

735
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
is that the whoever is behind such an

736
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,240
such an activity is able to to drag

737
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,039
or change the medical information from

738
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
those devices

739
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,480
to something else they can either

740
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,919
destroy it encrypt it steal it

741
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,960
sell it

742
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
or in any other way

743
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,320
play with that depending on what is

744
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,360
their

745
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
um

746
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
objective

747
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,559
i'm i'm speeding up a little bit because

748
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
i i know that we've got you know half an

749
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
hour and probably about you know 15 or

750
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
20 minutes of me talking and and then i

751
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,039
would really love to

752
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,039
see your questions i i can see that they

753
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
are popping up in the chat and in the q

754
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,760
and a session section but but you know i

755
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,399
will i will check them out when i'm when

756
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,360
i finish

757
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,120
okay moving forward

758
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,919
uh another problem or another area of

759
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,760
problems are the potential attacks on

760
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
the autonomous or semi-autonomous

761
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
vehicles

762
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,000
that

763
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,120
you know

764
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
once the technology becomes available

765
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,960
once it gets cheaper and more

766
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,039
accessible um

767
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
being the

768
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,159
semi or fully autonomous devices

769
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
uh could become

770
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,240
uh like an another set of of of of uh

771
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,880
avenues or vectors for for an attack so

772
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
for example they could be used as

773
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,080
weapons for in for example in runover

774
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,960
attacks so uh i forgot to mention that

775
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,039
but why one of the research centers that

776
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,240
i collaborate with at ucl it's called

777
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,000
the dose center for future crimes that

778
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
analyzes the

779
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,240
opportunities or potential for such

780
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
attacks and tries to

781
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
like proactively design

782
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
the preventive or or mitigating

783
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
measures to to counter them so one of

784
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,320
the analysis made by my colleagues over

785
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,679
there described the potential abuse of

786
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,320
autonomous vehicles and using them as

787
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,440
weapons

788
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
or on the other hand remotely disabling

789
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,960
them and then blocking the roads or

790
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,799
bridges for example if we've got a

791
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
scenario because what we do

792
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,919
over there at my my department at ucl is

793
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,679
to to make us uh and like an educated

794
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,440
scenario based

795
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,480
predictive analysis of potential attacks

796
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,279
so

797
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,360
uh we worked on a scenario of a

798
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,240
terrorist attack happening in physical

799
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
environment in a city

800
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,519
where autonomous vehicles are remotely

801
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,320
disabled disabled to

802
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,279
block roads leading to that area

803
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,320
thus slowing down the response of you

804
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,120
know police fire fighters paramedics and

805
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,519
so on and you know the final bullet

806
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,080
point here it might sound a little bit

807
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
over the top

808
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,240
uh

809
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
and a little bit sci-fi but also we we

810
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,760
contemplated and analyzed the the

811
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,159
scenario or potential scenario

812
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,799
of using the those vehicles as potential

813
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
kidnapping devices probably not you know

814
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
in the next couple of years

815
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,519
but perhaps in the future like in like

816
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,000
say five or ten years uh once the

817
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,240
technology becomes more accessible and

818
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,279
cheaper

819
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,000
uh

820
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
it could also be one of the

821
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
avenues that the criminals would uh

822
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,919
would would analyze and and

823
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,679
probably

824
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,240
sooner or later

825
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,679
use

826
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,919
the use of the drones and various types

827
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
of them so not only uavs than the

828
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
unmanned aerial vehicles but also ground

829
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
operating and hydroid

830
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,760
drones

831
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
that that could be used for criminal or

832
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
terrorist objectives

833
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,519
uh so what for you know there you know

834
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,559
you've got here on this slide several

835
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,600
potential methods that are or or

836
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,080
motivations behind abusing the drone

837
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,320
technology some of them are quite

838
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
obvious like using them for surveillance

839
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,720
for example or to deliver drugs which

840
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
has already happened but also one of the

841
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,279
scenarios that for example the the

842
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,519
british military the ministry of defense

843
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
in schievenham

844
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,760
considers to be one of the most serious

845
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
threats to the security and safety of

846
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,679
aviation is the use of the

847
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,760
semi-autonomous drone swarms

848
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,240
to disrupt the air traffic control in

849
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,640
civilian aviation or disrupt military

850
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,519
command and control

851
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,640
systems

852
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
so

853
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,519
you know all of those types of drones

854
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,399
the aerial ones or the hydroid ones or

855
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,960
the or the ground operating

856
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
drones

857
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,320
are

858
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,799
are a serious serious threat if the

859
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,240
technology

860
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,440
is intercepted or or creatively

861
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
calibrated for for criminal

862
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,120
uh

863
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
objectives

864
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
another problem that you know my

865
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,159
colleagues

866
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,480
at those center for future crime study

867
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
is the potential application for

868
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,519
criminal or terrorist

869
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,519
objectives of the of the military

870
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,880
robots and this particular slide

871
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,120
my might seem to be

872
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,679
a little bit sci-fi

873
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,440
and i'm i'm pretty sure you are all

874
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,840
aware of the boston dynamics

875
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,720
uh

876
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
inventions and and know-how so you know

877
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,320
how those those robots work

878
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
and of course that technology is

879
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,960
extremely expensive and not really

880
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,520
available to everybody interested

881
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,000
but uh my point is that

882
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,159
as with all of the technologies that we

883
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,239
are dealing with they will become

884
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,040
cheaper they will become more available

885
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,639
and accessible

886
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,520
uh

887
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,320
so

888
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,599
we might at least the least we can do

889
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,239
is to do like a scenario based

890
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,560
predictive for forecasting analysis of

891
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
the potential abuse of those

892
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
technologies

893
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
uh to

894
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,000
proactively

895
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,800
working like we we've got a bit of time

896
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,839
especially with technology like this

897
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,879
to to design methods or counter measures

898
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,879
that would counterbalance the potential

899
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,719
abuse of such a

900
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
such a technology

901
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,160
uh the huge huge topic you know that no

902
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
i wouldn't have enough time to discuss

903
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
all of that today is the potential abuse

904
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,839
of of artificial intelligence uh

905
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,920
technology so on this slide you know and

906
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,560
i from what i what i understand is that

907
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
this presentation this video

908
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
will be

909
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,200
available later so if you're interested

910
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,520
you can get back to some of those slides

911
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,400
to

912
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
to read them if you like so those are

913
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,920
the ai milestones just from the last uh

914
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
decade and if you have a look at that

915
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
you know some of those things that are

916
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
listed here

917
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
just a couple of years earlier before

918
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
they actually happened in real life

919
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
were considered to be

920
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,640
science fiction types of scenarios you

921
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,480
know for example you know this will

922
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
happen probably in the future but not

923
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,680
sooner than in like 25 years

924
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
whereas it happened it happened in like

925
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,079
two or three or five years

926
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,359
so this

927
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
this technology

928
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,599
that is being developed in an

929
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,520
unprecedented pace

930
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,040
and it goes much faster and beyond all

931
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
of the expectations from just a couple

932
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,000
of years ago so sure enough

933
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,440
it it is and will be

934
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
creatively

935
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,599
abused by uh by the bad or malign uh

936
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,280
malign actors

937
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,960
and you know i'm not the kind of a

938
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,680
person that reads the slides but this

939
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
particular one i want to draw your

940
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,800
specific attention to because i uh

941
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,440
my my guess is that some of you are

942
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,520
interested in technologies in ai and

943
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,760
machine learning technologies so from

944
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,839
the point of view of my discipline the

945
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,160
crime science discipline artificial

946
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,640
intelligence can be used

947
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,599
at various like angles so it can be used

948
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
as a tool for a crime

949
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
it can be used as a target for criminal

950
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,560
activity

951
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,200
the an interesting bit is is is an

952
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,359
artificial intelligence or related

953
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,680
technologies used as a so-called context

954
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,480
for crime so when we have the malign or

955
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
illegal activities

956
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,200
that might depend on such a scenario

957
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,160
when the victim or victims believe

958
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,200
that

959
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,640
there is some ai functionality

960
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,520
uh

961
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
even though it doesn't really exist so

962
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,160
somebody like the the creative criminals

963
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
or scam artists might convince their

964
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
victims that they have like for example

965
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,359
the

966
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,920
ai algorithm or a tool

967
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
that can

968
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,920
perfectly well predict the stock market

969
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,480
uh fluctuation and their victims might

970
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,119
believe that and then you know

971
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
put their money on specific technology

972
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,839
or on specific stocks and finally from

973
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,400
the point of view of of of my my

974
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
discipline

975
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,160
uh crimes involving uh

976
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,520
ai since they are highly scalable

977
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
uh they can be

978
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,160
very easily marketized uh

979
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
later so we we use the expression of

980
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,880
so-called crime as a service that's that

981
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,040
that last bullet point

982
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,160
and artificial intelligence is a perfect

983
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,280
example of of such a service where the

984
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
where the criminal abuse of that

985
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,560
technology can be leveraged scaled and

986
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,880
sold

987
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,440
uh my colleagues from the dos center

988
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,440
organized just just before coveted uh in

989
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
the in the spring of early spring of

990
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,359
2020 the

991
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,480
uh the workshop on on the ai enabled

992
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
future crimes and what you can see here

993
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,359
on this slide are the bullet points

994
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,359
pointed list of the

995
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,599
of of the crimes that

996
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,480
were considered by the by the experts by

997
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,320
the crime science expert to be of a

998
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
specifically high concern

999
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,680
so

1000
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,240
our idea was to

1001
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
bring in

1002
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,320
uh dozens of experts from from various

1003
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,079
fields around artificial intelligence

1004
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,920
machine learning and crime science and

1005
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
related fields

1006
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,960
and then

1007
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,440
do a

1008
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
scenario based analysis of of the

1009
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
potential

1010
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,599
criminal acts

1011
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,560
uh leveraging the ai technology so what

1012
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,040
you can see on on the slide here are

1013
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,359
those so-called high concern crimes for

1014
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,599
just you know a year and a half ago

1015
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,680
from from the lease that we created back

1016
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,720
then

1017
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,280
so i'm sure that you're all familiar

1018
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,160
with uh with all of what's listed here

1019
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,040
but you know the specific concern are

1020
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,119
the deep fakes audio visual

1021
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,720
impersonation

1022
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,760
and a i altered this information that i

1023
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,640
will move to move to talking about

1024
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,720
uh very very soon

1025
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,200
uh and just a final bit you know this is

1026
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,079
what happened uh almost almost to the

1027
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,880
day a year ago the uh the attack on on

1028
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,119
one of the leading uranium

1029
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,400
uh

1030
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
uranium enrichment uh experts who was

1031
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,880
who was assassinated in iran

1032
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,160
uh

1033
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,319
by the israeli operatives who are using

1034
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,839
satellite

1035
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,839
control ai assisted

1036
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,800
um military rifle to to kill that person

1037
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
without any operatives present on the

1038
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,160
ground so the device itself was was

1039
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
placed in iran

1040
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,319
but the whole execution of the

1041
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,280
of the attack was was uh performed with

1042
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,400
the use of such an iai assisted

1043
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,079
uh rifle

1044
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,960
where the operatives were were in a in a

1045
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,480
different country they were using

1046
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,280
satellite uh imagery to uh to a you know

1047
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
to to to select the moment for the

1048
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,000
actual execution of that attack and the

1049
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,200
ai

1050
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
algorithms

1051
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,680
compensated for the recoil of the rifle

1052
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
that was shooting at the target

1053
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,720
and it happened a year ago you know if

1054
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,040
you just a few years back if you would

1055
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,119
hear about something like that you would

1056
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,119
you would you would

1057
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
i'm pretty sure that the majority of the

1058
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,240
people me including included would say

1059
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,079
that something like that is not possible

1060
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
to happen let's say the next 10 or 20

1061
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,359
years um and it this this happened a

1062
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,800
year ago

1063
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
okay i will skip this because we are

1064
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,560
running out of time and this is a fairly

1065
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
well known

1066
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,280
problem the abuse of of cryptocurrencies

1067
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,440
for for criminal uh

1068
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,720
reasons so i'm moving to the uh

1069
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,880
to the disinformation misinformation

1070
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,319
problem right now

1071
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,520
so as a one of the layers of of cyber

1072
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,839
warfare so what's listed here

1073
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,480
uh are the well-known

1074
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,359
uh

1075
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,359
strategies of cyber warfare like the

1076
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,640
attacks on critical national

1077
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,400
infrastructure or state-sponsored

1078
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,720
hacking but what i'm really interested

1079
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,800
in is the uh are the attacks on

1080
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,119
democratic systems of government

1081
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,520
and the propagation on disinformation

1082
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,720
and and and misinformation

1083
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,960
around the world so i know that no we've

1084
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
got probably

1085
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,319
only a couple of minutes left so i will

1086
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,440
try to be as specific guys as possible

1087
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,480
so i'm

1088
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
pardon me for for skipping a couple of

1089
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,920
slides

1090
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,040
uh

1091
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,200
and i will be happy to share them with

1092
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,920
you along the video that you will you

1093
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
will you will be able to access probably

1094
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
in the next couple of days

1095
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,839
uh so just to summarize everything that

1096
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,920
i said so far you know from the point of

1097
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,079
view of law enforcement or or

1098
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,000
governmental agencies responsible for

1099
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,359
law enforcement

1100
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,319
the

1101
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,040
the

1102
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,720
information technologies that are

1103
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
available are the sum of all fears

1104
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,760
because they they they take all of those

1105
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
boxes here and they make up a perfect

1106
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,400
tool for the

1107
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
criminals or potential offenders or

1108
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,440
terrorist terrorists worldwide and this

1109
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
is very very difficult to stop

1110
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,200
or or prevent or or mitigate

1111
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,400
okay so moving to the information

1112
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,920
environment

1113
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,720
a word of explanation those terms that

1114
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,800
you can see on this slide

1115
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,359
are very very frequently

1116
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,800
uh misplaced or used as synonyms they

1117
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,960
don't mean the same thing so if you hear

1118
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,359
about this information or misinformation

1119
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,680
they are not the same this information

1120
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,079
is a false information that's propagated

1121
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,839
in order to cause hormone to do bad do

1122
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,880
evil

1123
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,119
whereas misinformation is the false

1124
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,560
information

1125
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,000
but the

1126
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
intentions behind the propagation of

1127
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,640
that are are benign so people genuinely

1128
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,119
believe that something is true even

1129
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,680
though it's not and they they distribute

1130
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,160
that information in their

1131
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,440
social networks or or or inform or or

1132
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,160
family or friends circles hoping that

1133
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,079
they will help somebody whereas they

1134
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,680
they are they are doing quite the

1135
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
opposite but unknowingly and finally

1136
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,160
there is a term of male information

1137
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
which is genuine

1138
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,640
but the intention behind it

1139
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,160
is to cause

1140
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,040
uh

1141
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,319
harm so all of that in total

1142
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,359
uh

1143
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,000
is like the wh oh the word health

1144
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,319
organization that i'm i'm on one of

1145
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,280
their working groups uh calls that whole

1146
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,160
problem domain the so-called

1147
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,520
uh infodemics so that term is not new it

1148
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,960
was current as far as i remember in 2003

1149
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
during the original

1150
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,960
sars epidemic by david rodkopf in his

1151
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,640
article in the washington post to

1152
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,520
describe the information overflow

1153
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,560
during the health and humanitarian

1154
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,720
crisis but this is a really really good

1155
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,119
expression to describe what we are

1156
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,440
dealing with

1157
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
with now especially what we are

1158
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,440
experiencing today

1159
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,040
during decoded pandemics where

1160
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
all of those emotions for example that

1161
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,720
are listed here

1162
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,760
were

1163
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,800
were exacerbated or steered

1164
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,760
by

1165
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,560
not only by the disease itself but

1166
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,880
because of the information overflow

1167
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,839
surrounding that so the disinformation

1168
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,200
or misinformation can be used by malign

1169
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,800
actors to steer emotions such as fear or

1170
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
anxiety or anger

1171
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
and also they make

1172
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,920
people more susceptible to manipulation

1173
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,880
which makes makes the audience

1174
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
you know both the perfect target

1175
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,079
for the attack using the disinformation

1176
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,040
techniques but also a perfect vehicle to

1177
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,280
broadcast or or share it even

1178
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
even further no there are various

1179
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,960
motivations behind that you know

1180
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,359
depending on who is standing behind this

1181
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
but the most important one is the

1182
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,760
political political destabilization

1183
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
for example like undermining democratic

1184
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,640
legitimacy of government or or meddling

1185
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
with election processes

1186
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,839
but also you know more business or

1187
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
economy uh oriented uh

1188
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,560
oriented objectives or like the last

1189
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,440
bullet points says sowing chaos and

1190
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
and discord likes

1191
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
to use the famous quote

1192
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,760
some people just like to watch the word

1193
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
uh burn

1194
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
so over here you've got a couple of

1195
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,760
sources of the disinformation or

1196
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,319
misinformation surrounding the

1197
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,119
uh

1198
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,040
the covet pandemic but

1199
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,520
just to explain it to you clearly it's

1200
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,359
nothing new you know

1201
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,280
it happened before like for example one

1202
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
of those photographs here is about the

1203
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,520
operation infection you know operation

1204
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,480
infection was the soviet kgb

1205
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,880
disinformation operation

1206
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,240
uh in the early 1980s um about the hiv

1207
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,040
virus and aids

1208
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,680
disease so so the

1209
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,800
the rationale behind the kgb operation

1210
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,520
infection was to

1211
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
convince the public in different

1212
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
countries around the world

1213
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
that the

1214
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,839
hiv and aids were designed by the

1215
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,119
american military as a biological weapon

1216
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,560
and it was distributed uh

1217
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,920
around the world

1218
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,560
uh to to kill people and you know the

1219
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,160
the rationale behind that was to

1220
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,559
discredit the united states

1221
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,280
you know it happened in the early 1980s

1222
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
and you know they they didn't have the

1223
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,000
technology and social media that we have

1224
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,800
uh that we have now but still they

1225
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,760
they were able to raise suspicion uh

1226
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,319
right now whoever is behind like

1227
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,880
anti-vox movements or conspiracy

1228
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,280
theories surrounding kovit has the

1229
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,720
plethora of opportunities to do it much

1230
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,000
more

1231
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,880
effectively or as i'm sure we are all

1232
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,960
very well

1233
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,160
aware of and this those methods you know

1234
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,520
sharing

1235
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,839
this information misinformation and

1236
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,839
propaganda

1237
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,040
doing it on a large scale fits very well

1238
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,240
into the

1239
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,480
general scheme of the so-called hybrid

1240
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,880
warfare this is a really popular

1241
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,680
uh

1242
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,960
buzz word that i'm i'm sure you are all

1243
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,319
uh uh

1244
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,720
aware of that we are experiencing uh

1245
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,880
experiencing in the western

1246
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,559
world you know hybrid warfare is a

1247
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,240
combination of a classic military

1248
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,200
tactics with the so-called irregular or

1249
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,800
or asymmetric

1250
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,040
warfare including the cyber

1251
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,359
uh warfare you know and the

1252
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,839
uh

1253
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,720
the i cannot say you know beauty behind

1254
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,240
that but you know the

1255
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,599
uh

1256
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,839
the rationale behind that that that

1257
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,000
while while using uh

1258
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
methods or measures like that whoever is

1259
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,079
behind such such stretch strategy can

1260
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,640
maintain a fairly high degree of

1261
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,200
plausible deniability

1262
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,240
and

1263
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,960
an attack or weaken the the opponent

1264
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
without the the perceived uh

1265
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
involvement so

1266
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,599
this method was was mastered uh by by

1267
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,240
the soviet union and is is being used

1268
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
and abused by the by the by russia

1269
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
especially under under the rule of

1270
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,280
vladimir putin

1271
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,559
so uh one of the valerie gerasimov the

1272
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,440
russian chief of of the general staff

1273
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,240
uh

1274
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,800
you know many years ago said that the

1275
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,599
the

1276
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,400
those so-called non-kinetic methods of

1277
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,640
warfare including propaganda or

1278
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,520
disinformation or hybrid warfare

1279
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,319
are vastly superior to the

1280
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,599
classic

1281
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,000
conventional military methods because

1282
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,240
they are much cheaper than they can be

1283
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,960
executed remotely

1284
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
and we can always say

1285
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,079
that no

1286
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,839
we didn't do that we don't know who did

1287
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,920
it you know russia employed that during

1288
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,319
the invasion of crimea and the invasion

1289
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,720
of ukraine using the so-called little

1290
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,920
green man

1291
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,839
and completely denying their involvement

1292
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,760
of course everybody knew who is behind

1293
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,839
that but couldn't like officially

1294
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,000
prove that and russia is using those

1295
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,359
strategies

1296
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,359
as at the larger

1297
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,079
scale within their of quite quite

1298
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,200
official strategy called new generation

1299
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,079
uh

1300
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,079
warfare which

1301
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,400
is designed to lead the

1302
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,359
uh

1303
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,240
lead the conflict along the whole

1304
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,480
spectrum of methods and measures

1305
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
including

1306
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,880
election meddling political interference

1307
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
political corruption

1308
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,960
uh raising

1309
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,319
or exacerbating societal divisions in

1310
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,400
the countries being attacked and so on

1311
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,960
and the primary targets are like right

1312
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,000
now

1313
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,520
are our nato and eu member states that

1314
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,760
that russia like wants to to draw to to

1315
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,559
run the wedge into to

1316
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,440
to destroy their their unity and destroy

1317
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
their collaboration

1318
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,160
and to to meddle with you know with the

1319
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,040
will and and thoughts and beliefs of the

1320
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,640
of the uh

1321
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,960
of the population so they are using that

1322
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,280
those strategies quite brutally

1323
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,720
especially in in in europe but also they

1324
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,839
they've used that in the united

1325
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,240
states uh

1326
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,920
so this is a a part of their military

1327
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,280
dog train you know the other uh actor

1328
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,880
behind this information and

1329
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,680
misinformation but it's it's being done

1330
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,839
much more

1331
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,319
gently uh

1332
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,680
is china

1333
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,480
but in the case of china as opposed to

1334
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,359
russia this is not about

1335
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,480
destroying their the the uh

1336
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
other countries but other by

1337
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,000
about showing the superiority of of

1338
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,960
china and about their long-term plans

1339
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,880
like made in china 2025

1340
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,119
um or the

1341
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,920
berton road initiative and so and so on

1342
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,839
so they are more about the economic

1343
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,119
political

1344
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,720
and philosophical you know domination

1345
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,760
whereas russia is more interested in

1346
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,839
being in the military

1347
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,640
uh uh

1348
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,680
influence and political influence uh in

1349
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,119
in a much more

1350
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,839
uh brutal and direct uh

1351
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,880
way

1352
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,839
and then you know i i know that i'm

1353
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,559
almost running over time so just to move

1354
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,440
on fairly quickly you know in in terms

1355
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,720
of the

1356
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,000
artificial intelligence and technology

1357
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,280
uh

1358
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
application to the study

1359
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,520
uh of uh of this information and

1360
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,480
misinformation so it's it's uh it's a

1361
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,119
kind of a double-edged sword so the same

1362
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,280
technologies can be used to

1363
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,920
generate this this information

1364
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,040
but also to detect this information or

1365
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,240
or uh or misinformation you know the

1366
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,280
i'm i'm fairly sure that you are very

1367
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,000
well aware of those those technologies

1368
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,800
so i will just mention them quickly

1369
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,319
two main ai approaches that are are

1370
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,480
being used to study

1371
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,359
this information misinformation are the

1372
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,760
gans the generative adversarial networks

1373
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,480
when we've got two neural networks one

1374
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,200
is the the discriminator and one is the

1375
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,440
generator the and they

1376
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,160
uh one of them is trained to to general

1377
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,480
generate false information the other one

1378
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,599
is to

1379
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,480
uh

1380
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,720
uh is trained to distinguish between

1381
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
true and false information

1382
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,839
and they uh they're like competition

1383
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,559
leads to the creation of the

1384
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,720
of the false information which is

1385
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,200
impossible to distinguish from the uh

1386
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,359
from the factual information and the

1387
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,000
other ai approach that is

1388
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,480
clearly linked to the

1389
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,319
disinformation and misinformation

1390
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,480
problem are the large language

1391
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,559
large language models

1392
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,599
what we there are various approaches to

1393
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,079
how to use the ai tools

1394
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,599
to study analyze and and combat this

1395
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,160
information so you've got them listed

1396
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,839
here and you know some of them are very

1397
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,760
basic like for example the content-based

1398
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,640
ai approach for the study of information

1399
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,240
this information

1400
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,440
is quite outdated because it's um

1401
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,800
you know it's

1402
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,440
retroactive and very very time

1403
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,160
time consuming so it's based on on the

1404
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,400
information from for example facts

1405
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,599
checking sites that somebody else like a

1406
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,960
you know human

1407
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,119
humans or groups of people

1408
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,400
uh

1409
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,480
selected the information analyze

1410
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,520
information and and just

1411
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,000
mark them as true or false so those

1412
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,160
algorithms are trained

1413
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,480
based on somebody else's

1414
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,040
assumptions or analysis the social

1415
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,680
response

1416
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,079
approach studies ai

1417
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,520
enabled approach studies how the users

1418
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,640
react to the to the content they they

1419
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,599
experience or they they come across

1420
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,319
online so they they rate the correlation

1421
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,599
between

1422
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,160
the reaction of the users

1423
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,160
when how they react to true or to the

1424
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,079
false information

1425
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,920
the hybrid approach combines the

1426
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,799
social reaction with the so-called users

1427
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,680
characteristics where users are ranked

1428
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,880
or rated by the so-called suspiciousness

1429
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,920
score

1430
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,880
uh

1431
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,960
and and how they

1432
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,119
interact with the content and how they

1433
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,480
share that

1434
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,200
uh and finally you know the graph uh

1435
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,520
graph approach studies how the

1436
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,079
information spreads through the network

1437
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,160
with the basic assumptions that false

1438
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,160
information spreads in a different

1439
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,960
fashion in different vectors than true

1440
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,079
information and then the multi-modal

1441
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,799
that's fairly simple multi-modal

1442
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,200
information multi-modal approach is

1443
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,040
studying of the information coming from

1444
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,280
different modalities to build better

1445
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,839
predictive models to for example to

1446
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,079
study the textual and graphic

1447
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,960
information but my point is that only if

1448
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,920
we combine all of those methods we can

1449
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,200
actually

1450
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,480
uh detect the this information

1451
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,880
and the propagation of this information

1452
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,400
uh

1453
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,680
quickly

1454
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,559
and

1455
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,760
and finally the the modeling what can

1456
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,160
how can we use the technology

1457
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,799
uh to to model uh the propagation of

1458
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,599
this or misinformation

1459
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,319
um so one of the uh

1460
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,400
now we use modelling to

1461
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,480
to understand

1462
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,280
threads uh better so first of all we can

1463
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,040
use modelling to see

1464
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,000
how the interactions or links between

1465
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,760
agents are are formed to compare the

1466
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,799
those of those who are created or who

1467
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,400
are who are formed in a natural fashion

1468
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,240
like between humans

1469
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,720
or which which of them could be created

1470
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,160
artificially

1471
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,440
like between between uh bots

1472
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,280
uh then we can use those modeling to

1473
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,599
study the actual dissemination of

1474
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,040
information

1475
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,720
within the network

1476
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,760
uh like for example to to study which

1477
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,599
agents or which persons or bots are the

1478
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,000
nodes or hubs

1479
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,079
for for the propagation of

1480
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,480
this information and finally we can use

1481
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
the modeling to study

1482
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,440
how the

1483
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,480
sheer access to information can

1484
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,720
uh influence the

1485
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,839
you know the

1486
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,680
sources or the timing or the dynamics of

1487
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,559
of how the information is propagated

1488
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,359
across the network in order to

1489
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,599
maximize the effectiveness of this

1490
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,319
information

1491
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,720
campaigns so if you're interested in

1492
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,000
those issues no on that final slide

1493
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,640
there is a list of of publications that

1494
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,880
me and my colleague from johns hopkins

1495
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,040
university wesley moy who is who has

1496
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,920
been my my research partner for almost

1497
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,079
two years now that we've uh those are

1498
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,640
the papers that we've published together

1499
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,760
or are about to to be to be printed

1500
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
uh in the last two years so

1501
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,839
uh i was only able to you know to

1502
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,079
summarize some of those issues very very

1503
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,920
quickly today but for those of you who

1504
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,720
are interested in more detail uh you've

1505
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,960
got a whole list of um

1506
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,319
of

1507
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,640
like references here that that are

1508
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,359
they're open access so or will be open

1509
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,760
access those of them who are not that

1510
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,960
are not in print yet uh

1511
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
so you can you can find them easily

1512
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,880
i i'm you know really sorry for for

1513
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,839
taking much more time that i was given

1514
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,119
and i'm you know sorry for speaking for

1515
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,240
for for too long but i just thought that

1516
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,240
i'll just give you a

1517
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,200
s

1518
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
wide overview of the problems that i

1519
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,760
study and my colleagues are interested

1520
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,400
in with the hope that perhaps some of

1521
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,200
you

1522
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,359
would be interested in collaboration

1523
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,599
research i research research work

1524
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,799
together and so on so i'm once again i'm

1525
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,559
extremely grateful and very very

1526
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,200
privileged to be here today and if there

1527
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,000

now so there is a maybe this is uh this

1543
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,720
is a question from medina williams i can

1544
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,079
only see one question i don't know if

1545
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,520
there were any other

1546
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,200
in the q a

1547
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,079
bar so i read a paper a while ago about

1548
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,000
ai and criminal responsibility

1549
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,839
what are your thoughts on who is

1550
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,559
accountable responsible etc for models

1551
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,599
and outcomes from their usage also what

1552
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,599
are the considerations for this between

1553
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,960
eu with gdpr and us in the us with

1554
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,119
national privacy laws

1555
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,880
uh so you know answering the

1556
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,760
the first part of uh

1557
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,640
of of your question about the

1558
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,480
the criminal responsibility if i

1559
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,319
understand your question correctly is

1560
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,559
that who burst responsibility

1561
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,880
for the abuse of the

1562
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,960
ai

1563
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,359
technology and actually it doesn't

1564
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,400
really need to be

1565
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,960
the artificial intelligence it can be

1566
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,440
any other technology that i described

1567
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,040
today you know it can be you know social

1568
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,079
media it can be the drones

1569
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,720
it could be i don't know the olb

1570
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,680
electric toothbrush so or artificial

1571
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,079
intelligence uh so you're absolutely

1572
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,400
right you know the

1573
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,880
[Music]

1574
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,079
in in asking that questions because the

1575
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,119
um

1576
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,520
we can we can have like a you know

1577
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,960
twofold that

1578
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,599
type of an approach one would be to say

1579
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,440
that you know nobody's responsible you

1580
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,520
know there is a technology that's that's

1581
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,559
there

1582
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,720
uh the only person who can behold

1583
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,280
responsible for abusing that is a is the

1584
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,200
abuser you know the criminal or a

1585
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,960
terrorist or a you know whoever

1586
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,839
hijacked that technology to to hurt

1587
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,599
other people

1588
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,680
and i think that this is the

1589
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,839
from the point of view of criminal law

1590
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,480
and criminal procedure or the or the

1591
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,400
criminal investigation

1592
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,559
this is the only

1593
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,760
reasonable

1594
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,760
approach that you can apply

1595
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,000
because if you would

1596
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,240
hold the the developers of the

1597
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
technology accountable

1598
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,440
uh

1599
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,280
the you know i don't know about you know

1600
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,280
i'm not i'm not an expert in the u.s

1601
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,559
criminal procedure but i i would guess

1602
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,680
that

1603
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,920
it would be extremely

1604
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,720
uh

1605
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,599
difficult to put that on trial you can

1606
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,440
you can you could do that in the form of

1607
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,200
a criminal case or a civil lawsuit but i

1608
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,280
don't think that it would be

1609
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,640
practical

1610
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,559
uh and effective because you know in

1611
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,480
theory you could say that this is the

1612
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,839
same

1613
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,039
problem like for example you know

1614
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,119
my area of work for a long time was was

1615
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,319
uh homicide multiple homicide

1616
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,160
and school shooting

1617
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,760
so for example

1618
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,079
you could turn your the question that

1619
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,400
you asked to you know what what happened

1620
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,839
you know last last night in um near

1621
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,200
detroit

1622
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,960
and ask you know who is who should be

1623
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,200
heard accountable you know the guy who

1624
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,039
shot up his school

1625
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,000
or the

1626
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,400
manufacturer probably called

1627
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,200
who

1628
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,240
produced that ar-15 that was used in

1629
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,640
that horrible crime

1630
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,680
uh

1631
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,520
you know i don't know how to how to

1632
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,119
answer that from the point of view of

1633
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,000
criminal investigation the easiest way

1634
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,960
would be

1635
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,799
would be to go after the the perpetrator

1636
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,559
you know if we know who abused this

1637
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,960
specific type of a technology

1638
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,000
that's it

1639
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,920
but i think that your question is much

1640
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,400
more important than i was able to answer

1641
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,200
that

1642
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,319
so far

1643
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,559
because i think that

1644
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,440
once the those technologies

1645
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,960
start to form a really important part of

1646
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,319
our lives and they will sooner or later

1647
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,839
affect us all

1648
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,520
i'm sorry for the background noise this

1649
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,359
is my dog

1650
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,319
so they will sooner or later affect us

1651
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,760
all and we and we cannot just say okay

1652
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,520
it's not the developer's fault somebody

1653
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,799
did bad things abusing the technology

1654
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,400
maybe they should be

1655
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,960
responsible to some extent

1656
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,240
for

1657
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,119
various backdoors in that technology you

1658
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,400
know the

1659
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,760
uh

1660
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,319
for the code that they written

1661
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,839
slowly

1662
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:46,559
uh

1663
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,119
for for the opportunities that they gave

1664
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,200
by not securing the technology properly

1665
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,880
i i know that you know what i'm trying

1666
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,599
to say seems might seem

1667
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,160
seem that i'm you know like i'm avoiding

1668
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,880
or dodging the proper answer but i think

1669
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,240
that it's it's

1670
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,119
it's a much more philosophical

1671
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,920
question then i would be able to answer

1672
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,119
it it now and please absolutely please

1673
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,760
do email me at one of those addresses

1674
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,599
that i've given because i would it's

1675
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,000
it's it's a fascinating question i would

1676
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,079
like really really like to follow up on

1677
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,119
that

1678
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,880
and answering the second part of your

1679
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,799
questions about the privacy laws and

1680
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,480
gdpr

1681
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,599
uh

1682
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,200
i don't know if you are referring

1683
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,839
specifically to the to the artificial

1684
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,680
intelligence perhaps to the uh

1685
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,880
to the

1686
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,000
uh

1687
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,400
open source intelligence domain or the

1688
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,880
information gathering from from open

1689
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,280
source or from social media how it

1690
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,799
interacts with the

1691
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,760
gdpr laws in in europe or the or the

1692
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,280
united states

1693
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,920
privacy national privacy laws

1694
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,039

the

1698
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,440
the so-called ethics in in

1699

ethical domain of technology or ethics

in artificial intelligence

are

1703
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
extremely hot topic in the legal

1704
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,520
community at least here on this side of

1705
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,280
the atlantic so

1706
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,520
as we speak you know the the european

1707
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,720
commission

1708
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,680
uh

1709
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,920
is working on the on the document called

1710
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,760
the you know the uh the the ethics in in

1711
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
artificial intelligence

1712
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
i don't know how it will

1713
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,119
look like

1714
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,000
uh

1715
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,559
one once they produce that and once they

1716
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,200
they introduce that because they i i'm

1717
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,240
i'm i'm a little bit skeptical about the

1718
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,200
potential of the eu bureaucracy to solve

1719
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,160
it

1720
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,160
um you know properly and and and and you

1721
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,200
know

1722
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,480
and well

1723
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,280
uh

1724
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,119
but but you know at least they're

1725
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,880
they're trying but

1726
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
i think that you know to tell the truth

1727
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,400
you know answering your both of your

1728
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,000
questions medina

1729
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,039
correctly would require me

1730
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,920
getting prepared and having

1731
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,240
a nice hour to

1732
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,640
to speak about that so

1733
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,440
uh seriously i would i would get ready i

1734
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,000
would prefer if you could just drop me a

1735
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,640
line on email i would be really happy to

1736
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,960
arrange for a zoom caller skype call and

1737
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,240
discuss it

1738
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,960
discuss it further uh

1739
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,720
and then there are some questions in the

1740
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,160
chat

1741
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,880
uh joel do we have a couple of minutes

1742
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,520
or you have to go now um

1743
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,000
in in the chat i i believe that there

1744
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,359
were more comments uh on some of the

1745
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,440
slides obviously very positive comments

1746
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,920
on the slides i i'm not sure if i don't

1747
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,119
think that there are actually any

1748
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,720
questions left there

1749
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,559
but i have to tell you that that i do

1750
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,280
highly suspect that medina williams will

1751
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,960
be reaching out to you she was one of

1752
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,760
our

1753
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,760
super bright phd students here and uh

1754
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,160
we've had some conversations uh this

1755
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,079
this last month in october i guess we're

1756
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,160
not the first of december but in october

1757
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,440
and uh yes her interest areas uh overlap

1758
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,680
very much as some of your expertise so i

1759
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,760
i do very much uh suspect that she will

1760
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,600
be reaching out to you and and you know

1761
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,799
i encourage you to do so

1762
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,040
yeah so with that uh

1763
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,439
