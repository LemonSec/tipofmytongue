1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,159
start off by saying welcome to everyone

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,319
who's tuned in to

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,600
this week's

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,240
serious security seminar

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,120
uh

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
we're very fortunate this week to have

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,799
jennifer back as our

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,240
speaker and she has been working in the

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
area of cyber risk measurement and

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,680
management in a number of roles for

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,039
quite some years

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
as an investigator as a

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,599
chief information security officer

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
a management officer

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,880
as a

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
professor

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,760
and

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
probably a lot of other roles too but

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,879
along the way she's built up an

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
incredible knowledge of cyber security

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,360
metrics

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
and today she's going to share with us a

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
history of those so please

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
welcome jennifer and take it away

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
thank you jean

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
i just love the name of this

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,640
group that you've started serious

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,280
serious security right um way back in

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,799
the day when you started it there

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,400
weren't that many people too serious

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,799
about security and now there are a lot

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,680
so

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
uh

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
you have um

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
had a big influence thank you

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,080
we do have um

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
as spot mentioned i do have a lot of

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
background in cybersecurity this talk is

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,119
kind of

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
long and complicated and it's meant to

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
be an overview so i'm going to speak

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
kind of fast and and put in a lot of

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
references

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
this is really designed to give people

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,759
a big picture of how we got to where we

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
are with security metrics by starting

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
with security so you can read up on my

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,439
bio some other time you'll have all this

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,600
online

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
so

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,920
measure

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,439
versus metrics i'm just going to start

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
with the basics because i know some

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
people are coming here

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
because they're interested in the topic

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
and they're looking at it for the first

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
time

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
when we think of measurement we're using

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
a ruler or some way to map

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
from

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,920
something out there in the real world

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
too

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
uh some kind of

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
attribute characteristic

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
uh

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
it's not necessarily a number

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
but it's an attribute of the thing being

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
measured so when you're measuring

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
security you there's no thing called

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
security you don't measure security you

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
measure other things and you infer

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
things about the object which is

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
security from what it is you are

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,560
measuring

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
weather is like that you don't measure

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
the weather you measure the temperature

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
and the humidity and the

78
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,280
the

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
wind speed and things like that and you

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
come up with conclusions about weather

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
and that's how we measure security

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
so measures versus numbers i mentioned

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
that you can have a measure that's not a

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
number a measure can be a label you know

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
colors are labels exists not exists

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
that's a measure

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
if you can

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
order your labels and put them in order

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
as we often do in security we have a

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
like a low impact event the medium

91
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
impact event and a high impact event

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,879
then you can put them in order and you

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
can use those as measures as long as

94
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
every time you make the conclusion that

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
something is low you've got some

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,959
algorithm to follow so that someone else

97
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,040
can make the same conclusion

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
and we call those ordinal measures

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
an interval measure now we're getting

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
into quantity numbers

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,319
so we have a number and we know

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
that the quantity of that number

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
is the same for every unit so if we have

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
a unit and an interval we can say

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
what the measure is

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
and temperature is like that there is a

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
fixed degree of temperature and we can

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
go up and down and we give it a number

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
ratio on the other hand is like an

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
interval but there is a zero so you

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,959
start with zero you can't go back to

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
infinity and maybe you can't with you

113
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,319
know depending on your uh temperature

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
measure either but

115
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
a ratio

116
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
is meant to be with respect to zero so

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
you're measuring a quantity of things

118
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
and

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
it could be that there are none of them

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,360
and

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
you really want a good intro to all of

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
that stuff in 2007 deborah herman wrote

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,639
a great book on that topic

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,600
so

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
in

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
security

127
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,280
people have different measurement

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
criteria and in rebecca's book and in

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,199
jenkins book and all these books on

130
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,040
security we have different opinions

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,199
about what measurement criteria should

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,720
be

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
they typically

134
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
revolve around these core criteria and

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
and they these criteria are common in

136
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
other sciences that you want an accurate

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
measure it can be quantified it can be

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
correct according to specifications

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,160
consistent that's why the low medium

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
high is frowned on by a lot of people

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
because

142
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
you don't really get consistency in that

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
measure a lot but

144
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
it still counts if you can make that um

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
ordinal measure

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
consistent time based replicable unit

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
based if you can make it in terms of a

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
unit you know what it is that

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
absolute attribute you're measuring

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,639
then you have a much better chance of

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,919
having a

152
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
good measurement that's repeatable and

153
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
informative if you're measuring things

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
just to count things like you know how

155
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
many uh

156
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
um

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
packets have fallen off my firewall

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
might not be all that informative

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
on your overall picture of what your

160
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,639
security looks like so we value measures

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
that are informative

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
this talk is going to cover metrics as

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
you know milestones in cyber security in

164
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
general you can't really understand what

165
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
a metric is going to be without seeing

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
where we were in computer security and

167
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
then information security and now cyber

168
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
security which is a continuum from the

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
1960s and probably earlier although in

170
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,880
the 1960s that's when businesses started

171
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,759
to

172
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
you know ubiquitously rely on computers

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
and it was very necessary to have some

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
way to measure the integrity of the data

175
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
minimally in order to understand that

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
financial statements were correct so we

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
started computer security measurements

178
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
with auditors

179
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
and we moved through these stages over

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
the years

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,039
um

182
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,280
logical theorems consensus on standards

183
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
i'm going to go through

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,240
the history of cyber security very

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,280
quickly

186
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
and then get to why

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,919
these measures made sense back then and

188
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,440
how they are building on each other and

189
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,080
moving forward

190
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
circa 1960s in the beginning

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
there was a mainframe most companies

192
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
just had one computer

193
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
and they secured it by putting a guard

194
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,400
in front of it and anybody who wanted to

195
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,360
use the computer had to take their punch

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
cards which were their input mechanisms

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
up through the guard sign in sometimes

198
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
someone else would take the punch cards

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,039
and load them sometimes they got to

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,400
stand next to the computer and do it

201
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
themselves but that was the security

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
so

203
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,400
um

204
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
what did the auditors do they started

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,479
saying okay what are our objectives for

206
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
control in that computer we we know that

207
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,720
it's secured and people are putting

208
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,919
punch cards in coming out and we need to

209
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
know that the data has integrity they

210
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,039
weren't so much worried about

211
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,639
confidentiality back then except in the

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,000
military but they wanted to know that

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
too that there were only you know

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
physically um secure people in the room

215
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
and so they had um measures to know when

216
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
the when the data had been exhausted

217
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
from the computer and then it started

218
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
back up again but we're starting with

219
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
the auditors here not with the military

220
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
and

221
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
what happened was a global consortium of

222
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
auditors started to meet every year at

223
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
these conferences these audit

224
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
conferences and form a little computer

225
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,199
audit committee and come up with

226
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,479
standards and procedures and best

227
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
practices to figure out whether the

228
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
computers actually worked whether they

229
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
had integrity whether the data

230
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
could be trusted and they called these

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
audit standards as you would in any

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
management environment your control

233
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
objectives uh there was a association

234
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
called the edp auditors association that

235
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,560
came up with an input output test for

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
computers that they did with audit they

237
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
had the same set of data and if they put

238
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
the same set of data in multiple

239
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
computers and i got the same output and

240
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
they also then

241
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
took the data in

242
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
you know to manual calculators human

243
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
calculators calculated all the numbers

244
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
that that should be output based on the

245
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
input and if the computer came up with

246
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
the same numbers on their tests then

247
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
the computer was secure at least i had

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
integrity

249
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
and that's

250
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,279
we still have tests like that not as

251
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,958
frequently as um

252
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
we don't do manual calculations but we

253
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
do test computers against each other and

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
we call it an integrity metric

255
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
so the units of measure

256
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
are attributes of a single computer

257
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
whether it is

258
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,440
processing accurately or not

259
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
so here we are back at the mainframe and

260
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,839
people started to connect terminals to

261
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,920
it so you didn't have to go into the

262
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
computer room anymore so what we did was

263
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
we secured the offices where the

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
terminals were and we had computer

265
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,240
security people go through the walls to

266
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
test that the mainframe

267
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
cables only went to

268
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,640
offices of authorized users and

269
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
the ciso at back in eric mellon who is

270
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
now a head of operations of the fsi sac

271
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
that was his first job in computer

272
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
security

273
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
so then people got workstations and that

274
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
was a great office productivity thing

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
nobody really thought it was a problem

276
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,880
because they were just doing documents

277
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,760
and they were local on their

278
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
workstations so

279
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
um and they were trusted um power users

280
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,560
so

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
that that just went by the wayside with

282
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
security and auditing

283
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
until they started um

284
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839
using those computers to actually affect

285
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,360
the books and records of the firm and

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
then we had to make sure that all of

287
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
those workstations were behind some kind

288
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
of physical security

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
boundary

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
then these power users found out that

291
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
there were other people with computers

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
that would rent them out to them and

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
they had hard time getting to mainframe

294
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,959
data because it was very expensive for

295
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
any company to do programs and they were

296
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
really highly specialized business

297
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
critical programs back then so if they

298
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,839
wanted to do something on their word

299
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
processing that was cool like um

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
mail merge

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
a set of email addresses with a standard

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
document they could get some kind of

303
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
vendor to do it and they could upload

304
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
their data to some vendor and then the

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
vendor could print out all of their mail

306
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
and um and so

307
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,839
we had time sharing services on

308
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,480
on vendor computers and we connected to

309
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
them by telephone but anybody who could

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
afford a computer

311
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
we assumed had physical security and

312
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
after all we're using their computer so

313
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
they were the ones that should be

314
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,760
protecting it from us and we didn't have

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
you know other than knowing that we had

316
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
to log in with something because that's

317
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
how we were built

318
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
it wasn't a big security threat

319
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
and then uh

320
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
our power users started to be able to

321
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
connect with each other in the same way

322
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,560
to share work across local area networks

323
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
and now we're in the 1980s

324
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
so

325
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
how do we measure things now so with

326
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
individual computers in the 1980s there

327
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,600
was a

328
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
research group

329
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
in a

330
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
precursor to the national institute of

331
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
standards and technology

332
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,680
and

333
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
it was a public private

334
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
group that had researchers

335
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,079
from academia and

336
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,680
places like the military and government

337
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
and they came up with standardized

338
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
terminology for trusted computer system

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
evaluation

340
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
everyone was really concerned about

341
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
military computers and and making um

342
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
secrets safe

343
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
and they came up with ways to describe

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
what safety meant

345
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
by creating symbols for computer

346
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
subjects and for computer objects like

347
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,440
files and

348
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
creating logical theorems around how

349
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,399
subjects could access these objects

350
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,639
whether running them or reading them or

351
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
writing to them

352
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,040
and

353
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
through that work they came up with

354
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
basic principles we still use today how

355
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
do you identify that subject how do you

356
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
authenticate that it is that subject at

357
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,839
that computer

358
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
moving into access control that was

359
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
electronic not just sitting at a cable

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
and

361
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,120
how do you audit what they've done how

362
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
do you know that nobody's getting in the

363
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
way of what they've done or nobody can

364
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
observe what they have been doing other

365
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,800
than the rules that you set out and this

366
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,639
was a phenomenal book we call it the

367
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
orange book because it was a

368
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
one in a series of books that were all

369
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
different colors affectionately called

370
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
the rainbow series so

371
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
computer

372
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
security people were just given this

373
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
orange book by government and industry

374
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
associations and that's how we all

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
learned what these concepts meant

376
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
once we had these concepts then the

377
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
trusted evaluation criteria was to see

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
if your computer had these functional

379
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
capabilities and if they did not

380
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
you might have minimal protection

381
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,279
if you had discretionary access control

382
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
a user could share data with anyone as

383
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
long as they had access to it that's

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,639
discretionary

385
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,560
um the mandatory access control would

386
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
mean that the that the

387
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,279
administrators had to decide who could

388
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,560
have access to what in every case and

389
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
as you got further up the evaluation

390
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,920
criteria you had to make sure everything

391
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
was labeled it was structured properly

392
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
that the

393
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
code was um

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
coming out with the right result

395
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,399
and

396
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
you could split security domain so that

397
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,519
people

398
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
who had access only to you know

399
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
confidential information couldn't get

400
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,079
top secret and you could verify the

401
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,199
design

402
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
with your logic

403
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
unfortunately nobody i think

404
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
there were a lot of attempts to get up

405
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,279
this ladder but not with a commercial

406
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
product past c2 by the time

407
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,480
the networks came in and auditing and

408
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,959
verifying individual computers became a

409
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,399
waste of time because everything was on

410
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,760
the network anyway

411
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,639
so

412
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,040
nevertheless we do have these units of

413
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
measure that are attributes of an

414
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
operating system even today and we

415
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
measure the configuration of operating

416
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
systems with these objects

417
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
it's a little bit about the math that

418
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
you use to move from one to the other

419
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
you have you know no change for adding a

420
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
discretionary access control because

421
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
you've already got it in c2 but you can

422
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,839
get a higher score by

423
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,800
moving up

424
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,959
the ladder of requirements and trusted

425
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,399
design

426
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
so here we are back

427
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
and it's

428
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,120
the

429
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
mid 80s and we're moving towards the 90s

430
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
and the land connects to the mainframe i

431
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
foreshadowed this by saying the network

432
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,440
was going to ruin everything so we have

433
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
the um

434
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
inability to tell who's on the other

435
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,600
side of a connection to the mainframe

436
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
and people start actually doing

437
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,480
fraudulent transactions and you know

438
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,440
sending money to each other and

439
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
using all these great computer business

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
operations

441
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
for various purposes and

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
so we have now access control lists

443
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
as specified in the orange book but

444
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
commercially now um available and

445
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,720
operational and entitlements that might

446
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
not meet all of the trusted computing

447
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,959
criteria but they're good enough for you

448
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,240
know business uh operations and we can

449
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
trust um what happens in the mainframe

450
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,040
now

451
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
and then uh

452
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,759
we

453
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,959
wanted to take advantage of this network

454
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,720
communication not just internally but

455
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
externally and instead of

456
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,560
sending letters and data

457
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
back and forth to each other on tapes we

458
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,560
could just put it in email and

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
even in the smallest businesses then

460
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,560
usually some engineer in charge of the

461
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
network that would go out and get an

462
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,680
email server so that they could

463
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,399
communicate through this public-private

464
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
network called the arpanet where we had

465
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
universities and

466
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,800
government and some

467
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
big businesses especially dod

468
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,959
collaborating and doing research using

469
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
this arpanet

470
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,720
and that was about 1988 and then

471
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,360
we had a situation where

472
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,959
a

473
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
college student who was very familiar

474
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,040
with computer security because

475
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
he used to hang out where his father

476
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
worked in bell labs and bill labs

477
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,759
computer security professionals became

478
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,120
much more valuable prior to

479
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
the general population because at the

480
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
time in the 80s most of the hacking was

481
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,560
happening happening on

482
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
telecommunications networks because

483
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
phone calls were very expensive back

484
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,199
then and hackers could sell phone calls

485
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
by programming the

486
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
public switch phone network using the

487
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
buttons on their phone while they

488
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
weren't buttons then they had ringers on

489
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,079
their phone anyway rotary dials

490
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,199
could be used to to defeat billing in

491
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,720
the phone system

492
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
they figured out how

493
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
and

494
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,559
at t was working on a way to restrict

495
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,959
network access to authorized telecom

496
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,559
users so they're working on that and

497
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,799
robert morris the guy whose father

498
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,439
worked at bell labs um

499
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
saw these email servers and said boy

500
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
these are wide open this is terrible you

501
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
know we're trying to close down the the

502
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
phone network here and and we're opening

503
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,960
our our internal networks up to whoever

504
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
wants to come in and he wrote just to

505
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,600
prove this so he said his motivation was

506
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,240
to show the world how unsecure this was

507
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
and he wrote a worm that literally took

508
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
down the arpanet it copied itself to

509
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,799
every email server that it could find

510
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,200
and it kept sending mail to as many

511
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
other email servers as it could find

512
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
until all of the computers that accepted

513
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,200
email

514
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,840
and then a lot of them that were

515
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
sharing resources like mainframe disks

516
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,679
and things went down and couldn't

517
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,880
operate

518
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
and

519
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,240
that was

520
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
that except for

521
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,880
the one place that was safe was a t

522
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,120
because bill labs was experimenting at

523
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
the time with something they called a

524
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,559
firewall to block network traffic that

525
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
was unauthorized and the firewall could

526
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
was immediately employed to keep the

527
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,559
worm out and the lance was safe so now

528
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
everybody has a firewall nobody could

529
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
even dream of going onto the internet

530
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
without a firewall and that's the

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,720
beginning of that story and then save

532
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
behind the firewall

533
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
we started to use that um

534
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
network that was the arpanet moved to

535
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,440
the internet privatized or at least had

536
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,799
a standards organization in charge of it

537
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,679
and

538
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,120
allowed

539
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
any anyone who had the technical

540
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
capability and uh equipment to connect

541
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
to what we now call the internet we put

542
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
our web servers on the internet it was

543
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
more like a catalog that we had they

544
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,840
didn't have e-commerce but we could put

545
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,679
our catalog on the web server and a

546
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
phone number and then people didn't have

547
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,960
to go to a store to find our products

548
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
and they could call us and order them

549
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
and that's what we did

550
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,799
and then we realized that that whole

551
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
thing that was happening with the with

552
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,320
the worm on the email server could

553
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
probably come through our time sharing

554
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,000
and bulletin board services so we locked

555
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
those down with some

556
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
telecom

557
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
magic like

558
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
caller id you know we're only going to

559
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,559
answer calls from this caller or

560
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,320
when i see the caller id i'm going to

561
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,400
hang up my modem and call them back so i

562
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
know it's really them that i'm talking

563
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
to on the other side so we had that type

564
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
of technology

565
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
and then

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
we got

567
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
hacked anyway

568
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,039
these web servers it turned out were

569
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
commercial products and in addition to

570
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,799
showing our catalog they let people

571
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,880
upload malware and uh

572
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,960
and play games and use the resources for

573
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
other things so we had to then lock down

574
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,360
the operating systems on anything that

575
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
was facing the internet so we called it

576
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
a hardened server farm demilitarized

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
zone is another term for it but another

578
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,840
firewall between the externally facing

579
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
computers and the internally facing

580
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,120
computers

581
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
so that's where we were

582
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
oh then we had to put physical security

583
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,679
around that because we didn't want

584
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
somebody going and plugging into that

585
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,480
part of the network without our

586
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
permission

587
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,240
all of this became really

588
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,679
an issue for

589
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
technology support now everybody's using

590
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
the internet all the time using email

591
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
all the time and using these web servers

592
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
before they were just using these little

593
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,720
workstations now technology support is

594
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
called in the middle of the night to go

595
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
fix things so they give the technology

596
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
support people laptops and or even big

597
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
computers to bring it home and they let

598
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
them dialing over the phone network the

599
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
same phone network that we had just

600
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
blocked from our friends and family

601
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,400
so what we had to do was

602
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,240
create a second factor of authentication

603
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,320
the second factor of authentication is

604
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
now um ubiquitous it's uh

605
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
there might be a second third fourth

606
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
factor of authentication you know

607
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,280
biometrics and all but back then this is

608
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
when it started that you needed more

609
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,039
than just a password to get in

610
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,280
because these passwords could be guests

611
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
they could be hacked through the phone

612
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,840
network and the

613
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
token administration uh

614
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,240
locked down these um telecom inputs to

615
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
our remote workforce

616
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
so here we are in 1995.

617
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
and we think we're set up pretty good

618
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,440
how do we know how do we know we're set

619
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,039
up pretty good every machine is

620
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,880
different every there there is no one um

621
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
orange book we can consult to verify

622
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,760
that

623
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
all of those different security controls

624
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
those red boxes are configured

625
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,320
adequately

626
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
so a global consortium gets together you

627
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
know great minds in the world

628
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,360
comes up with something called a

629
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
protection profile

630
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,600
so it's up to you business to know what

631
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,039
how you're planning to secure that

632
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,440
you've got the token access over here

633
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
you've got the firewall over here you've

634
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,159
got the operating system stuff here

635
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,600
that's all part of your

636
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
protection profile

637
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,080
that's

638
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,039
your security target is something that

639
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
you're going to target to make sure that

640
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
all of those security objectives are met

641
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,200
on that on all of the devices

642
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
and

643
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,799
we will measure that we'll evaluate that

644
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
by looking at the target of evaluation

645
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
as in its operating environment so while

646
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
you're developing all this stuff you're

647
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
deciding what the security should be

648
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,880
you're writing it all down and

649
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
we will formally verify that the

650
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
security functions work

651
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,159
that

652
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
the structures are in place for

653
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,400
secure operation

654
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
we'll test it methodically going through

655
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,520
these

656
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,039
um

657
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,120
more and more formal

658
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,080
uh

659
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,799
verification processes to see what the

660
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,720
design was like and whether the design

661
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
was actually implemented properly

662
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
and the higher you can get on this list

663
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,600
the more secure you are so it's kind of

664
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
similar to

665
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,919
the uh

666
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,360
orange book and that it's got these

667
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,120
levels if you do more testing you'll

668
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
find more out but it's all based on the

669
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,919
fact that you've already got the

670
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,440
documentation of how security should

671
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,159
work you're not discovering it

672
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,159
so your units of measure

673
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,159
are all of these um

674
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,559
requirements and you're seeing that

675
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,240
you've got this ordinal measure of the

676
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,919
target of evaluation you know it's

677
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
starting low and going higher but you've

678
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,080
got a shot at getting the correct

679
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
label because you've got very rigid

680
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,559
tests

681
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
another type of thing that came out at

682
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
that time was a project in carnegie

683
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,480
mellon called the system security

684
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,799
engineering capability maturity model

685
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,039
this was a rec in recognition of the

686
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
fact that you can't do those protection

687
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
profiles unless you've got really good

688
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
systems engineers knowing how computers

689
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
work and putting them together in a way

690
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
that can be constructed to uh

691
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,559
to come out with the right features

692
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,080
right so

693
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,880
uh

694
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,279
it gave a set of

695
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,799
features and requirements that engineers

696
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,600
should consider as they are building any

697
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,400
system and making sure that security was

698
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
at least

699
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,840
reviewed and assessed at every step of

700
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
the way for every function that was

701
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,880
going into the system

702
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
so the security activities aren't things

703
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,000
that are on this list and

704
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
again again we had a uh

705
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,559
ordinal

706
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,880
measure what that that

707
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,559
we could tell whether these things were

708
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
performed for every uh

709
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
system in our environment or maybe just

710
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
for this target of evaluation system

711
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
that they were planned and tracked the

712
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
engineering

713
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,400
life cycle activities were well defined

714
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,880
and these features were well defined

715
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
everything was controlled and if you

716
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
found an error you went back and fixed

717
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,919
it and you changed your process so that

718
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,799
you would be better next time so that's

719
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,039
another measure that we have

720
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
we still have that measure and it's uh

721
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
it was published by

722
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,279
uh various dod agencies and i think it

723
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,720
finally made its way to nist just a

724
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,960
couple of years ago um but it's the

725
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
attributes of the engineering process

726
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
that are designed to make sure you end

727
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
up with security so here we are

728
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
um back there in

729
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,640
1995 and the user terminals went away

730
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
they were replaced by

731
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
desktops and the desktops now can get

732
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,159
right to the mainframe

733
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,120
the

734
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,440
people have data on removable devices um

735
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
we have viruses coming in we have

736
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
viruses coming in from the internet too

737
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
because people are downloading them from

738
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,520
uh

739
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
malicious websites

740
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,799
and we still have floppy drives which we

741
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
have before they were non-nuisance

742
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
viruses but the usb ones and the

743
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
internet ones were much more destructive

744
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,880
so

745
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
we put antivirus on the workstations and

746
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
also put a proxy server which means

747
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
anybody who's on this internal network

748
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
trying to get to the internet they have

749
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
to proxy themselves out

750
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,919
they can't go straight to the internet

751
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,760
anymore this proxy server has a list of

752
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,279
malicious sites and it blocks people

753
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,440
from going to malicious sites or it has

754
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
a

755
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
list of

756
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,480
known good business sites and you can

757
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
only go to those sites

758
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,679
we still have proxy servers almost

759
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
everywhere the rules are changing and

760
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,279
you know at one point

761
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,880
the proxy server vendors could only

762
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
block 500 sites so you had to come up

763
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080
with better rule-based systems to know

764
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
what to block

765
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,559
had intrusions anyway so we put up

766
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,559
intrusion detection systems so we would

767
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
know when they were happening and they

768
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,520
sent alerts uh to it operations but um

769
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,880
there was really nothing to be done

770
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
other than to start a

771
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,799
computer security investigation because

772
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
we didn't have any way to stop the

773
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,440
detection we were just watching the uh

774
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
the viruses come over the network and

775
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,400
then trying to find where they landed

776
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,799
and then we gave clients um access to

777
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,240
the internet so that they could get into

778
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
our web servers and actually start doing

779
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,679
these online transactions not just

780
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,120
finding our phone number and ordering

781
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
from the catalog so

782
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
we needed a way to know who they were

783
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
because before that the client was a

784
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
business customer an account number they

785
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
we didn't know individually who those

786
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,159
people were at the client maybe we knew

787
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,080
the the person who signed the contract

788
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
and procurement but now we needed to

789
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,279
know all of the people who might

790
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
possibly log in so

791
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
they're not in our phone book our email

792
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,520
system um in any kind of organized way

793
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
we had to create identity management

794
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
systems to know who could access dark

795
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
computers um

796
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,039
and that extends to contractors and any

797
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
other person that's not in our employee

798
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,240
list

799
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,080
and the internet gradually took over all

800
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,480
the telecommunication that was lying you

801
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,159
know single line single line a lot of

802
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,600
people left these

803
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
telecom lines as a backup in case the

804
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
internet went down but these time

805
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
sharing and bulletin board services um

806
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
became

807
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
vulnerable to the internet threats just

808
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
as we were and we knew that they

809
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
probably didn't protect their

810
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
information as well as we did because we

811
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
had more money than they did and so we

812
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,720
had to encrypt the

813
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,799
data coming from our client workstation

814
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,919
so that

815
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,399
no one else on the internet could start

816
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
reading the usernames and passwords on

817
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,960
the wire on the network and

818
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,919
copying them um and logging in as our

819
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,720
client

820
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,159
back then we had to get certificate

821
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,440
authorities because there was nobody in

822
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,880
the business of giving certificate

823
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,600
authorities and ssl was very new and we

824
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,960
could support

825
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
encryption by putting certs on the

826
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,559
client and the server

827
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
and it would give you a higher level of

828
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,159
security that became very hard to manage

829
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,360
but we

830
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
put up with that for a while

831
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
and then we realized somebody could get

832
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
the usernames and passwords from our

833
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
remote workforce so we put a vpn virtual

834
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,919
private network to encrypt that traffic

835
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,120
and um

836
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
and synced that with the token admin

837
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
and then those internet um

838
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
i mean those uh

839
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
friends and family uh

840
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
third-party providers bulletin boards

841
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440
change to

842
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
online services and outsourcing

843
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
arrangements so we are all now on the

844
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
internet and we realize that we better

845
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,360
firewall them off too because they have

846
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
customers that are on the internet now

847
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
it's not just the big companies talking

848
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,039
to each other so we

849
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,880
encrypted the traffic that we're getting

850
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
from them as well

851
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,320
and that's about uh the year 2000 we're

852
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
going into uh

853
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,720
bicentennial with this kind of setup and

854
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
how are we measuring um security now

855
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
we've got all those vulnerabilities all

856
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,919
over the place so we're starting to

857
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,320
measure those and all these antivirus

858
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
vendors are starting to have a

859
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
competition on who could find the virus

860
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,600
first and when they found the virus they

861
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,640
named it

862
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
and i love this uh this

863
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
excerpt from this paper the

864
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,159
vulnerability tower of babel

865
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
the i think the citation is not showing

866
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,000
i'll put it in the front in the

867
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,760
powerpoint that i sent but um it is uh

868
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
showing how every different organization

869
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,000
has their there

870
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,320
has a different name for the same virus

871
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,960
so if you have two or three different

872
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
virus vendors they're calling it

873
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,159
something different and when you're

874
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
hunting through the network to find it

875
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,760
um it's

876
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
you don't know which pattern to use some

877
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,279
of the patterns are better than others

878
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,200
and so nist hosted this

879
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
conference

880
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,360
to

881
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
to try to pull people together everybody

882
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
who was labeling a virus please let's

883
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,159
just all give it the same name and they

884
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,440
called this effort the common

885
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,720
vulnerability uh enumer enumeration

886
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
uh common vulnerabilities and exposures

887
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,919
initiative

888
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,559
uh was started at mitre around the same

889
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,440
time

890
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,399
now this was the beginning of

891
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,440
sharing information about

892
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
vulnerabilities in a very high-tech way

893
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
they they actually shared their

894
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
information through

895
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,679
databases that were distributed until

896
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,799
finally

897
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,679
it became obvious that we needed to

898
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,279
consolidate this

899
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,159
in one place where there was only one

900
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
definition of each vulnerability

901
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,840
somebody had to win

902
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
and

903
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
this was combined with

904
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
the ongoing efforts to create

905
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
the national vulnerability database so

906
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,120
we're kind of skipping through a couple

907
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,600
of years here of security metrics

908
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
because this is all related starting

909
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
with that

910
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
we have to identify a virus we end up

911
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,480
with

912
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,600
we know what platform it's on we know uh

913
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,720
the extent to which it can be exploited

914
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,679
by time and by ease of use you know

915
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,840
privileges required

916
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,960
we

917
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,279
have an idea of what impact this

918
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,039
particular vulnerability could

919
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:21,919
have

920
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,519
and

921
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,519
we also allow this to be customized so

922
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
people can say well i i understand why

923
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
the the experts who classified this

924
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
vulnerability called it a

925
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,919
high impact but i just don't have that

926
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
kind of

927
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,159
environment or that software on my

928
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,440
network so i'm going to call it low

929
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,519
impact for me so you could customize it

930
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,960
but you're all starting out with the

931
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
exact same vulnerability and that was a

932
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,399
real uh great advance in cyber security

933
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,960
metrics so from icat and cve to the

934
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,279
national vulnerability database we now

935
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,080
have

936
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,159
unique vulnerability identifiers

937
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
references related software flaws

938
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,519
misconfiguration and baseline

939
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,880
vulnerability impact metrics again it's

940
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,159
it's ordinal

941
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,559
you can call this uh

942
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,480
you really can't call it anything but

943
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
ordinal because you're doing math on

944
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
nominal values and that's what people

945
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,799
don't like about ordinal but you're

946
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,799
coming up with a number that kind of

947
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,480
puts it in the ballpark of whether

948
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,600
somebody should be worried and you're

949
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,279
letting them change it with their

950
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,679
customizations so if you don't have

951
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,039
these vulnerabilities or you don't have

952
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,240
any critical ones you probably have

953
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
better security than somebody who

954
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,279
doesn't have them so your unit to

955
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,880
measure are over here and you get the

956
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,640
attributes of your vulnerability

957
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,120
software

958
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,159
tools for security metrics now

959
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,760
everybody now has all of these

960
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,039
vulnerabilities

961
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,600
in databases that their anti-virus

962
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
people are um

963
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,559
are accumulating and they know which

964
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,000
computers have the vulnerabilities and

965
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,799
they know

966
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,919
um

967
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,519
they're trying to track when they fix

968
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
them they know when they show up at the

969
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,960
network but they're not sure whether

970
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,120
they've had an impact so we start

971
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
looking at security incident and event

972
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
management technology where we can take

973
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
all of this incident information put it

974
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,399
in a database and figure out where

975
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,360
where our investigations should be spent

976
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,480
like we've got

977
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,320
now everybody started a sock with

978
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
between two and five people and which

979
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,080
which alerts that come out of these um

980
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,039
scene

981
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,559
event management systems these

982
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
anti-virus systems and all the other

983
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,320
platforms should be

984
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
looked at

985
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,559
so we go into security analytics

986
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,760
this is a

987
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,200
industry research

988
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
report that was

989
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,880
written in 2018 but it went through the

990
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,200
history of how we got this technology

991
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
and how it is evolving we're still using

992
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,159
it we'll always be using it

993
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,720
so the indicators of compromise are our

994
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
measures and we're ending up with

995
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,399
metrics on threats and vulnerabilities

996
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
this is something that looks

997
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,039
more like he would see in a common

998
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,600
business on the incident metrics

999
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
so this is the kind of board

1000
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,519
presentation version of

1001
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,079
the security incident and event analysis

1002
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,918
people look at impact they create their

1003
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,040
own ordinal scales for impact they have

1004
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
different types they have maybe

1005
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,760
different

1006
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,399
systems that they get

1007
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,719
reports from so

1008
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
that that's how they classify their

1009
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
system so they know their

1010
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,960
vulnerabilities so they know which

1011
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,440
experts to assign they measure the time

1012
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,679
to respond to these incidents

1013
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,639
and

1014
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
they might only measure the time to

1015
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,679
respond to critical incidents because

1016
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,040
they're interested in improving their

1017
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
security processes making decisions

1018
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
about how they respond to incidents

1019
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
based on their analysis and postmortems

1020
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,399
of

1021
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,000
the types of incidents that have the

1022
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,639
high exposure and the frequency of those

1023
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,480
incidents so

1024
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
the time to respond and the time to

1025
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,079
fully recover to full remediation um is

1026
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,079
a frequent security metric

1027
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,040
almost indispensable

1028
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,480
and also this one points out that people

1029
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,839
have different stages in their incident

1030
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
response so there

1031
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
this this one is showing that they have

1032
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,119
a problem with eradicating after contain

1033
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,280
but your issues could be anywhere on on

1034
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
the scale identifying analyzing

1035
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,119
mitigating

1036
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,079
so here we are now uh late um

1037
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,040
you know

1038
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,960
late 90s early 2000s

1039
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,839
and um we have

1040
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,960
people

1041
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,760
uh

1042
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,359
really getting frustrated that these

1043
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,040
proxy servers

1044
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,839
are

1045
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,079
preventing them from getting to sites

1046
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,920
and communicating the way they want to

1047
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
so they start emailing things out that

1048
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680
normally would be going through an

1049
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
internet uh

1050
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,960
gateway that might secure things so

1051
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,440
we had to put content filters looking

1052
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,160
for

1053
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,760
credit card information social security

1054
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
numbers anything we wanted to protect

1055
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,240
proprietary data algorithms on our email

1056
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
servers and our proxy servers just to

1057
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,839
prevent our own users from mailing that

1058
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,920
out in the course of business process so

1059
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
a lot of people got jobs based on what

1060
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
we saw in this content filter going and

1061
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,160
hunting down businesses and working with

1062
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,079
them to change their processes to

1063
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,560
automate something that would be more

1064
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
secure than the email they were sending

1065
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,079
out

1066
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
and then um we got um data shares

1067
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,440
well we've always had data shares but

1068
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,920
data data storage became really cheap

1069
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,160
we've had this usb storage people have

1070
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,280
been worried about they were trying to

1071
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,119
use antivirus on it and we also have um

1072
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,320
data in the data center on

1073
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,880
real large storage drives that people

1074
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480
were stealing out of data centers

1075
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
because they knew there was a lot of

1076
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,960
data on them i remember

1077
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
peter frampton's

1078
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,000
master version of frampton comes alive

1079
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,640
was stolen out of a data center in

1080
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,520
england because somebody took the disk

1081
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,720
on the server i don't know if they knew

1082
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
that they were getting frampton comes a

1083
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
lot but

1084
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,320
now we have keys on ships and data

1085
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,240
centers that are used to

1086
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,800
encrypt those data stores we have the

1087
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
data shares being encrypted as a routine

1088
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,400
method in uh

1089
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,280
file systems and we have encrypted usb

1090
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,359
drives to protect the confidentiality of

1091
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
the systems uh of anything that's on

1092
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
those usb drives

1093
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,280
and we're still getting hacked

1094
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
this is circa 2002

1095
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,599
and uh

1096
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,040
the next um thing that happens is

1097
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
we we're still getting hacked so we want

1098
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
to know how the hackers are getting in

1099
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,839
so we hire hackers to to

1100
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,000
pack our web servers we've always been

1101
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,599
we were always kind of doing that you

1102
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,520
know the bigger companies but now it's

1103
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,320
just become a scanning service that you

1104
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,599
can get someone to uh run an automated

1105
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,760
scan you didn't need the high cost you

1106
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,200
know 300 an hour hacker uh you you could

1107
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
get a service or just

1108
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
software like tenable software or

1109
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
qualifier

1110
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,839
introduced around the year 2000 and um

1111
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,440
you could scan your own servers so

1112
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,119
everybody started to do that it became a

1113
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
best practice and from there we got

1114
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
these vulnerability reduction metrics so

1115
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,480
we have um

1116
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
open vulnerabilities similar to security

1117
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
incidents you track those

1118
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
they're on your servers you know they're

1119
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
on there because you found them scanning

1120
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,560
or your service provider did you have

1121
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,040
some contact context around whether they

1122
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,599
are critical or high vulnerabilities

1123
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,359
you have some target that you want to

1124
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,680
make sure that you close them

1125
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,599
but for some reason you don't um yeah

1126
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,720
you've got

1127
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,920
all these vulnerabilities that have been

1128
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,680
there for 90 days and you're showing

1129
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,119
them over time

1130
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,359
time to close vulnerabilities you know

1131
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,280
maybe when you first start this exercise

1132
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,040
everybody closes and patches everything

1133
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
as soon as you find it but as time goes

1134
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920
on maybe they're not closing them um

1135
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,640
within 400 days or even with 100 days

1136
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
anymore so

1137
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
you're starting to see issues with just

1138
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,960
normal i.t operations um responding to

1139
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
security issues that are known and

1140
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
dangerous

1141
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,879
so

1142
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,119
step in national institute of standards

1143
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,599
and technology that had their first

1144
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,280
security metrics seminar in the year

1145
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,079
2000 and spent three years analyzing

1146
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,520
everything and trying to come up with

1147
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,760
some kind of guide for

1148
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
uh measuring information security a

1149
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
security metric standard that people

1150
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
could use to know whether they were

1151
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,280
secure

1152
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,760
it was a goal question metric approach

1153
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
just a you know a uh like any

1154
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,880
fundamental management activity where

1155
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
you're trying to

1156
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,119
have

1157
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,040
security implementation effectiveness

1158
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,119
efficiency and impact for all of your

1159
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,400
critical

1160
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
uh infrastructure internally

1161
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,240
as defined in your own requirements so

1162
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
you still have your own requirements and

1163
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
you use those

1164
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,880
uh to create measures that you then

1165
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,599
publish and quantify and you make sure

1166
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,960
that the result corresponds to

1167
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,760
the uh effectiveness of the

1168
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
implementation that you're trying to

1169
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
achieve with your security

1170
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
measures with your with your security

1171
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,079
technologies

1172
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,720
so um it also specifies that you need to

1173
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,160
trend this over time you need to make

1174
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,000
sure that you're

1175
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
continually monitoring it it's not a

1176
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
it's not a one and done

1177
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
thing you have to make sure that every

1178
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,599
security process you have is measured

1179
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
continuously to know that it's

1180
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
continuously operating in a secure

1181
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,839
manner and if um

1182
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,400
if if they're not operating in a secure

1183
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,760
manner then

1184
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
you're you're failing your security

1185
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
metrics so your units of measure are

1186
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,000
these

1187
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
measures that you created to quantify

1188
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,599
your performance measures and you're

1189
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,960
getting whether or not your security

1190
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,680
program is working

1191
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,480
here is uh again an industry example of

1192
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
how this was adopted you have somebody

1193
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,720
doing a firewall change control

1194
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,599
example and they are trying to figure

1195
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,000
out whether their firewalls are meant or

1196
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
performing according to the way that

1197
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,000
they were designed and should be

1198
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,160
operated safely so they count the number

1199
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
of the devices whether they are looking

1200
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
at the configs to make sure they haven't

1201
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
been changed if they're changed they

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,880
want to make sure that the changes are

1203
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
verified to be authorized if they're not

1204
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,839
authorized or not are not collected then

1205
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,839
those devices are suspect and if those

1206
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,000
devices are suspect then your security

1207
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,440
program is poor

1208
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
so you measure that and you get trend

1209
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,359
over time as per nist 855 which was

1210
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,720
updated by the way a couple of times

1211
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,920
since then getting better and better

1212
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
here we are 2006.

1213
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
i may go over time um

1214
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
or just tell me to stop and we'll wrap

1215
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,520
up at any time if that's the case all

1216
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,759
right

1217
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,200
okay so we have um

1218
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,119
the

1219
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,960
situation now where

1220
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,520
we are finding the the vulnerabilities

1221
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,119
in our web servers some of which have

1222
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,319
been known to

1223
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,040
security professionals uh software

1224
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,720
security professionals in places like

1225
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,680
oasp and sans some of the organizations

1226
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
that look at security flaws and found

1227
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,599
out that they're so typical we don't

1228
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,839
have to wait for a patch we can actually

1229
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,359
put in something called a web access

1230
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,960
firewall that looks for somebody trying

1231
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
to exploit a common vulnerability and

1232
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,119
cut off their access just for trying so

1233
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,920
we have that web access technology

1234
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,000
and we have wireless we we locked down

1235
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,119
our phones over here when we were

1236
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,000
locking down our data shares but uh

1237
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,359
some admin thought it was a good idea to

1238
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,760
put up a wireless network so that guests

1239
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,319
could have access to the internet and

1240
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,920
then the security people ran after them

1241
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,160
and two weeks later there was a vpn and

1242
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,640
token authentication on the wireless

1243
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
so about this time

1244
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,119
metricon started metricon was formed by

1245
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,440
danger uh one of the

1246
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,680
founding fathers of security who's best

1247
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,800
known for

1248
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,119
uh exposing microsoft for being very

1249
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,520
insecure and getting fired for it that's

1250
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
that's his claim to fame and annie

1251
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,440
jenkins who is an industry expert uh

1252
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,000
analyst at uh forester at the time and

1253
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,839
they drew together a bunch of volunteer

1254
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,960
people

1255
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,599
to look at security uh and got some

1256
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,440
vendor sponsors and and just started

1257
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
this

1258
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,079
this

1259
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
conference that they did side by side

1260
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
with unix conferences and things

1261
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
every six months for several years now

1262
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,640
it's been every year since

1263
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,920
uh

1264
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,280
up until 2019 was the last one and i'm

1265
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,880
sure it'll start up after this coveted

1266
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,560
thing is gone but if you look at

1267
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,359
securitymetrics.org you're going to see

1268
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,880
a host of things that people are

1269
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
measuring a host of things internal

1270
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,200
activity external activity

1271
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,599
i've mentioned some of those

1272
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,839
they create models i call this the

1273
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,920
modelers and the muddlers in the table

1274
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,640
of contents because it became this kind

1275
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,920
of you know what's more important that

1276
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,160
we look at every possibility that that

1277
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,200
might be uh indicator of a stochastic um

1278
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
measure like a probability that security

1279
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,599
might get bad or do we just look at you

1280
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,640
know what um

1281
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,079
what

1282
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,160
our models tell us like our design and

1283
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,760
and making sure that we can verify and

1284
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,240
validate it and so there's debate about

1285
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,800
that that's ongoing but this group

1286
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,880
created a bunch of

1287
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,520
publications like tons these are the

1288
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,280
books that i know of that were written

1289
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
by people in this group but there's also

1290
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
tons of academic papers presentations

1291
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,440
and they're very prolific in startups

1292
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,760
and things like that so this um

1293
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,160
this metricon conference has been the

1294
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,200
place to be if you are uh at all

1295
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,119
interested in security metrics the

1296
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,960
mailing list is still active believe it

1297
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,440
or not they still have an email list and

1298
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
it is still active and people talk about

1299
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,200
the latest problems and security metrics

1300
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,839
and if you are in charge of metrics at a

1301
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,839
large firm there are metrics for metrics

1302
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,880
okay

1303
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,440
why are we creating metrics for us for

1304
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,880
our technology environment or for the

1305
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,119
board you know what types of metrics are

1306
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,119
there you saw the list of metrics that

1307
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:57,920
in

1308
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
types that people characterized at

1309
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,839
metricon and this list is very small

1310
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,920
there's plenty more but every

1311
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
organization picks out things that

1312
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,720
they're they're interested in

1313
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
performance you know in internal

1314
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,960
security um uh

1315
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,400
um

1316
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,040
in uh internal uh threats compliance um

1317
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,760
targets 100 targets and monitoring are

1318
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,839
we monitoring and we

1319
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,920
and you know is our monitoring finding

1320
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,400
security issues so

1321
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,880
the types and use cases

1322
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
key risks key performance key control

1323
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,359
indicators are these measures telling us

1324
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,880
something that may happen leading

1325
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,319
indicators are they saying that

1326
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,319
something did happen a lagging indicator

1327
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,839
or are they are they real time

1328
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,480
concurrent so these are these are

1329
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,760
attributes of metrics are measures and

1330
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,440
metrics that

1331
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,280
help you define your metrics program

1332
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,560
and now we're about 2009 and we have

1333
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,880
virtual machines come in

1334
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
it becomes really hard to keep putting

1335
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,599
stuff in um

1336
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,280
data centers you know buying equipment

1337
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,200
and putting it in racks and plugging it

1338
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
in people want computers faster than

1339
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,720
that so we have these huge virtual

1340
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,000
machines and then we can put a bunch of

1341
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
smaller machines on them

1342
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,720
and

1343
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,440
we can then because there's so many

1344
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,040
machines in this one machine we usually

1345
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,839
try to lock those down really tight too

1346
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,800
especially if we're going to let um

1347
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,960
our vendors get to them which we started

1348
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,680
to do because it became so easy to spin

1349
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,280
up one little machine and make it secure

1350
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,839
we call them micro services so on our

1351
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,520
virtual machines now we have little

1352
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,359
micro services that are little security

1353
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,079
dmz's of their own where only one type

1354
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,760
of uh

1355
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
transaction can get in and out right so

1356
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,599
but we know that's highly secure

1357
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,880
but you know this is all very

1358
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,319
complicated too and we found out that

1359
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,520
there are a lot of vendors in this

1360
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,599
business so why not let them do it so we

1361
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,040
have cloud vendors

1362
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,560
and

1363
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,839
now we have to worry about all of our

1364
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,440
data going from our internal network to

1365
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,040
our cloud vendor so we need a firewall

1366
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,079
there

1367
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,839
and then we need to worry about what's

1368
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,359
happening in the cloud if somebody gets

1369
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,359
to the cloud directly how do we know and

1370
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,960
how is our data being protected and

1371
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
monitored so we take our security

1372
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,960
operation center that we put up earlier

1373
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,599
and we have it through another firewall

1374
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,240
monitor our cloud configuration and

1375
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,119
activity log statistics and

1376
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,280
use it as you know another touch point

1377
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,839
so then

1378
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,440
um we are

1379
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,200
moving into

1380
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,000
the

1381
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,599
uh late 2000s and

1382
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,920
what are our attacks most of them

1383
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,440
people are stealing

1384
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,800
uh login information including tokens

1385
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,359
and and anything from a desktop of all

1386
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,839
of our users our external users our

1387
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,839
clients our

1388
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,880
remote workforce and uh you know people

1389
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,319
who are

1390
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,440
you know just on our wireless network

1391
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,520
and they are using that authorized

1392
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,240
access in unauthorized ways and we find

1393
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,319
out that they're getting this access by

1394
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,599
looking at

1395
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,960
uh email

1396
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,000
and so we've always kind of had a way to

1397
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,599
you know

1398
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,680
be concerned about email and and clean

1399
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,160
out bad email from our email servers but

1400
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
if it's happening every day now on a

1401
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,839
continuous basis so we had to get

1402
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,839
anti-phishing technology and put it all

1403
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,280
over our networks and train everybody

1404
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,559
and hope that people didn't give their

1405
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,200
passwords away or get tricked into

1406
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
giving them um away

1407
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,480
by some

1408
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,160
nefarious adversary so

1409
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,559
where are we now

1410
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,680
now we're trying to use threat

1411
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,680
intelligence we're trying to find out

1412
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,480
how you know how we did get hacked so

1413
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,079
one of the things that we do is we hire

1414
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,400
vendors that go look at data

1415
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,760
and say

1416
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
is

1417
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,559
if there's a place that sells credit

1418
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,920
cards in the dark web did it come from

1419
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,160
our bank are those our bank customers

1420
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,920
and if so how is it possible that

1421
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,599
somebody could have gotten 100 000 of

1422
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,400
our customer records so big companies

1423
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,319
especially those who have had big data

1424
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,720
breaches now have threat intelligence

1425
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,119
teams either internal or external going

1426
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,640
out looking for

1427
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,480
hoping they don't find

1428
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,559
data from their networks out there and

1429
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,559
they call it a validation network

1430
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,880
metric that they are trying to

1431
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,720
make sure that in actual operation that

1432
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,880
data is not found out there

1433
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
and because so many people are doing it

1434
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,800
and they're they are

1435
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,440
looking at these vendors i mean sorry

1436
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,960
these adversaries

1437
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,800
they had to find a way to classify the

1438
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,319
adversary so that they could share

1439
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,599
information about them so they actually

1440
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,520
came up with a language the structured

1441
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
threat information expression

1442
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,440
that classifies

1443
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,960
about i don't know

1444
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,119
20 30 different attributes of threat

1445
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
actors and they share that information

1446
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,559
through a taxi server trusted automation

1447
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,559
exchange of indicator information and so

1448
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,240
everybody can download information from

1449
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,839
everybody else i call this the sharing

1450
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,079
part of metrics so that you can use that

1451
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,280
information to

1452
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,200
uh identify threats in your uh network

1453
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,359
so the threat you've got these units of

1454
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,280
measure which are sticks taxi and dark

1455
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,319
web uh traces and you can find out

1456
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,319
whether you are targeted or whether the

1457
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,440
threats are already in your network

1458
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
one of the metrocon members one of the

1459
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,880
most influential was a guy named wade

1460
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
baker who worked at verizon and he

1461
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,359
started this survey of the large

1462
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,720
companies that

1463
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,680
were

1464
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,920
involved in in metrics and ask them if

1465
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,520
they could just send their instant data

1466
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,880
in and their breach data and he would

1467
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,720
keep it anonymous but he would publish

1468
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,079
it by industry so they could see what

1469
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,079
was happening in their industry so he

1470
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,839
persuaded a bunch of people to do this

1471
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,040
and then

1472
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,839
um

1473
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,720
when law enforcement and other agencies

1474
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,480
found out about it they wanted him too

1475
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,119
and now this thing is is huge uh verizon

1476
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,599
still runs it it's still uh publishing

1477
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,920
data on the types of incidents in

1478
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,440
different um

1479
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,079
different verticals in in different

1480
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
industries as you see here education

1481
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,480
finance healthcare what patterns of

1482
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
criminal activity we're seeing there

1483
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,800
what actions are we seeing in that

1484
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
sector so it gives sectors a way to

1485
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,119
place themselves in some kind of

1486
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,640
hierarchy and they know

1487
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,440
that

1488
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,359
this hacking is you know again trending

1489
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,599
over time in some direction and they

1490
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,839
have this data by industry as well

1491
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,640
and

1492
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,240
it's a measure of security if your data

1493
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,640
is in that report you're you've got

1494
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,720
less security than somebody who doesn't

1495
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,559
have any overlap with this information

1496
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,480
whatsoever

1497
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,760
it's a way to know whether you're a

1498
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,280
target because if your peers are have

1499
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,960
been targeted then you're likely a

1500
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
target so the units measure are in the

1501
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,839
report and they're attributes of a cyber

1502
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,839
attack

1503
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,680
now along this line when everybody's

1504
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
starting to share information and nist

1505
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,880
is finding out what's going on with its

1506
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,480
security measurement

1507
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,520
it uh one of the metricon members and

1508
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,240
wayne jensen working at nist figured out

1509
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,160
that everybody's trying to measure

1510
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,520
whether their

1511
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,920
technical target of assessment is met

1512
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,119
whether their

1513
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,520
uh security engineering process is being

1514
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
followed but they're missing these

1515
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,480
bigger things about the actual data

1516
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,079
breach that occurred they're finding

1517
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,160
this out later by their threat metrics

1518
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,520
on the dark web

1519
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,240
so he put forth this special paper

1520
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,558
called

1521
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,599
directions in security metrics research

1522
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,760
yes and he

1523
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,680
emphasizes that correct security

1524
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,839
performance is not the same as effective

1525
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,160
that nist requires both that all metrics

1526
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,319
programs should require both and by the

1527
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,160
way it's just systems engineering the

1528
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,240
systems engineers have always had a

1529
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,920
concept of verification versus

1530
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
validation that was way back in the

1531
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
carnegie mellon study you verify that

1532
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,920
things are correct but you also have to

1533
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,240
validate it in operation in systems

1534
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
engineering terms since the apollo days

1535
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,440
they have called this building the

1536
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,720
system right

1537
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,880
you built it according to specs or

1538
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,640
you're building the right system you're

1539
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,160
building the one that's actually going

1540
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,480
to safely get to the moon and back right

1541
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,240
they should be the same thing

1542
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,079
but if your specifications are wrong

1543
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,000
they're not so you have to build

1544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,319
validation metrics into everything

1545
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,119
and that was a seminal paper

1546
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,200
and so here we are our validation

1547
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,640
metrics are failing because of these

1548
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,200
guys getting into our systems

1549
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
in 2017

1550
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,079
and what do we do we uh gets we we

1551
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,440
we didn't do this but some scoring

1552
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,119
services popped up and said i'm just

1553
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,480
going to scan you from the internet with

1554
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
my own tools and techniques and tell you

1555
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
how secure you are or not and then you

1556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,240
can pay me if you want me to

1557
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,839
tell you what the algorithm is and how

1558
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,920
to fix it so

1559
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,079
that was uh a big deal they're still

1560
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,599
there i'll say a little bit more about

1561
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,839
that in a minute but what

1562
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,240
um also happened about this time is that

1563
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,599
people went back to their governance

1564
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,319
risk and and compliance activities that

1565
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,000
were trying to measure whether their

1566
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,440
security programs were correct and

1567
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,280
emphasizing the word risk

1568
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,839
what is the chance that it's not correct

1569
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,599
where is our validation

1570
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,680
and so we got

1571
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,280
grc systems for internal use for use in

1572
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,160
evaluating our vendors and for using

1573
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,559
evaluating our clouds

1574
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,440
uh

1575
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,280
security as a service platform as a

1576
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,040
service etc

1577
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,880
and so we have this

1578
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,480
now

1579
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,760
oversight

1580
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,880
by risk management someone's separate in

1581
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,559
most large companies and is even in

1582
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,760
smaller companies they're starting to

1583
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,319
just say let's set aside somebody just

1584
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,920
to look at the risk and do only

1585
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,599
validation because

1586
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,240
this this verification is a you know a

1587
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,000
self-fulfilling prophecy everybody

1588
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,520
thinks their their

1589
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,319
their

1590
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,640
standards and procedures are working

1591
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,400
and these scoring services are telling

1592
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,280
them

1593
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,720
that we're not

1594
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,319
maybe they're not right but we'd rather

1595
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,799
have our own people uh look at this

1596
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,160
so um

1597
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,079
now we're getting hacked anyway why are

1598
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,000
we getting hacked now even though we've

1599
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,160
got this oversight going on

1600
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,400
well the one thing that we missed

1601
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,599
and we found out in you know in stark uh

1602
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,720
reality with the solarwinds hack is that

1603
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,119
we've been installing some software and

1604
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,400
you know we knew the stuff facing the

1605
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,319
internet might be bugging but stuff

1606
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,319
that's sitting on our main frame or on

1607
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,400
our internal networks we didn't expect

1608
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,559
to it to be calling home through the

1609
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,720
internet in ways that we couldn't detect

1610
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,240
so these advanced persistent threats

1611
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,839
have been stalking us from the internet

1612
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,359
the whole time

1613
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,760
and they have figured out it's easier to

1614
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,079
attack our supply chain

1615
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,359
and put

1616
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,040
malicious software on our internal

1617
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,640
network so you see these arrows now

1618
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,799
between the hackers and the

1619
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,119
and the targets are two-way they're not

1620
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,119
one way some of our internal targets are

1621
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,240
reaching back out to the hackers

1622
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,359
here we are 2020.

1623
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,200
security scorecards these are the other

1624
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
few words i'm going to say about them

1625
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,920
there was a big group of

1626
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,680
large companies that were very upset

1627
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,480
that these breeding companies were

1628
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,359
providing

1629
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:55,920
unsolicited scores of their security

1630
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,839
they formed a committee and the

1631
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,160
financial services committee to meet

1632
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,760
with them they brought in the u.s

1633
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,200
chamber of commerce and got other big

1634
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,799
companies to meet with them and they

1635
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,400
came up with these standards if you're

1636
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,720
going to do a security score card you

1637
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
should follow these standards if you're

1638
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,640
not following these standards we can

1639
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,400
accuse you of unfair business practices

1640
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,079
or something so that's that's what came

1641
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,280
out of the security scorecard stuff

1642
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,520
this um unit of measure we never knew

1643
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,640
what it was because they didn't publish

1644
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,400
their algorithms but it's just a

1645
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,119
spectator opinion of firm security until

1646
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,799
they actually

1647
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,559
bring us the transparency that are in

1648
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,640
these u.s chamber of commerce standards

1649
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,040
say a little word about the government's

1650
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,200
risk and control assessment programs

1651
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,520
because a lot of people use this

1652
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,280
exclusively for a security metric

1653
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,720
forgetting about all of the day-to-day

1654
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,760
operations and performance and

1655
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,799
vulnerability metrics they just say

1656
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,319
you know we're more worried about

1657
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,960
whether our risk is uh

1658
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,200
is higher than our tolerance for a risk

1659
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,359
we can afford to have some systems go

1660
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,720
down we can't afford to have them all go

1661
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,160
down so what do we need to do just to

1662
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,520
make make security incidents containable

1663
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,040
and there are a lot of risk management

1664
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,119
strategies to do this

1665
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,200
compliance standards are designed at the

1666
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,040
end of the day to to do this mark

1667
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,880
doesn't say you need to lock down every

1668
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,359
single soda machine in your in your

1669
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,240
plant but it does say what you need to

1670
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,960
lock down to make your risks reduced to

1671
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,160
an acceptable residual level so

1672
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,920
these compliance standards and

1673
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,760
third-party reviews i'll put the the

1674
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,520
cloud and critical suppliers in this

1675
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,720
category

1676
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,559
uh all fall

1677
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,520
um in a measurement category of a grc

1678
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,920
assessment where you decide what risk

1679
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,359
you can tolerate you decide what your

1680
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,119
target profile is and you see whether

1681
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,640
you're following it

1682
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,480
and you know when it when it comes to

1683
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
defining an algorithm for it you're

1684
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,240
defining an algorithm on a document

1685
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,160
you're saying when i do a test for a

1686
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,520
requirement in a document i'm going to

1687
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,280
call it met or not met i'm going to show

1688
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,760
you the ones that are not met

1689
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,200
so i in this example business metric for

1690
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
risk assessment we find somebody is a

1691
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,400
little lacking in some of the

1692
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,839
requirements nist says they should have

1693
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:04,799
for

1694
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,880
identify protect and respond and then

1695
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,680
they

1696
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,359
create a list of gaps and they decide um

1697
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,839
who should

1698
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,520
close those gaps or whether the gaps are

1699
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,440
within their risk tolerance right but

1700
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,520
the idea is that the higher you are on

1701
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,119
this bar of

1702
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,799
nist and other standards put them all in

1703
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,640
the same category of security assessment

1704
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,559
standards that you'll have better

1705
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,079
security

1706
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,359
unit measures subcategories and

1707
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,760
got to get rid of this

1708
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,520
anyway

1709
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,160
i can't see what's down there

1710
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,559
so we have

1711
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,079
example issues so now you've got issues

1712
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,359
they're coming out of these assessments

1713
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,119
you also have issues because you've had

1714
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,960
events that are negatively impacting and

1715
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,640
that you had to do some remediation for

1716
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,400
and they're open so you have to measure

1717
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,480
what issues you have open what you need

1718
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,520
to

1719
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,839
to change in order to get back to your

1720
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,000
acceptable residual risk level you've

1721
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,640
got an open uh you've got a target date

1722
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,200
a date by which if you don't do it then

1723
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,440
you've obviously reached your threshold

1724
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,960
twice and

1725
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,559
if you've retargeted something that

1726
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,000
means that you didn't have a good plan

1727
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,920
to remediate it to begin with

1728
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,599
your priorities for your open issues are

1729
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,440
relevant you know these are attributes

1730
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,280
of you your issues type some are

1731
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,720
critical this is an ordinal measure

1732
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,960
again if you don't set your ordinal

1733
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,839
measure that means you haven't

1734
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,440
calculated it that might be actually

1735
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,880
more frightening than having a critical

1736
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,480
one

1737
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,599
um

1738
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,079
and issue trends over time again it's

1739
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,000
performance of your grc program whether

1740
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,200
these issues get resolved uh and grc may

1741
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,559
blame the engineers because they're not

1742
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,400
coming in with their projects on time or

1743
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,760
on budget but it becomes a huge

1744
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,319
management thing so this is how metrics

1745
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,400
is reviewed at the uh the management

1746
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,640
level especially the board

1747
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,559
so here we have a scorecard metric i

1748
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,760
just put threw it into this slide

1749
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,359
because there was extra space that's

1750
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,720
what it looks like at the end of the day

1751
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,079
if you hire one of these companies they

1752
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,760
give you a score and it either goes up

1753
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,119
or down

1754
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,839
over time

1755
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,240
there's also

1756
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,480
an example of um

1757
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,720
what some people are doing in grc

1758
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,480
with coverage they're trying to figure

1759
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,160
out there are there are hundreds of

1760
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,680
different security technologies in the

1761
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,200
world do we need them all

1762
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,480
this has been a problem with security

1763
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,040
for years that you have um six vendors

1764
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,559
as we talked about

1765
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,280
it's all giving you the same antivirus

1766
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,200
stuff but calling it different things

1767
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,839
you know calling and calling the

1768
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,119
technology uh inherently different and

1769
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,559
we've got a better technology and we can

1770
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,839
do this and that and really the

1771
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,920
technology is about the same

1772
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,040
and so

1773
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
we have these industry analysts uh you

1774
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,920
can

1775
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,760
tag is one that's focused on cyber

1776
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,920
security so i'm using it but gartner

1777
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,400
forester also have these categories of

1778
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,520
security technologies and businesses use

1779
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,440
these to decide whether they need to

1780
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,520
investigate whether these technologies

1781
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,119
should be used in their company how many

1782
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,599
that how many do they have of my

1783
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,440
portfolio of cyber security tools and

1784
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,880
techniques whether they're operated by

1785
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,040
me rit or by the business

1786
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,559
have i covered all the things that are

1787
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,240
out there available that vendors are

1788
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,520
selling and if i didn't i know why not

1789
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,440
i know that i don't need one of those

1790
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,920
operational technology security tools

1791
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,160
because i have no operational technology

1792
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
systems on the other hand i've got a lot

1793
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,599
of application security and i'm seeing

1794
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,839
that i don't have all the technologies

1795
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,760
people are selling to reduce application

1796
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,680
security maybe i don't need them all but

1797
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,400
at least i'm using this to figure out

1798
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,319
that i'm aware of what's out there

1799
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,760
international standards like iso i'm

1800
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,920
going to wrap this up now

1801
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,960
same type of thing it's an assessment

1802
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,119
they're using it as a management tool to

1803
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,040
know that you've covered everything it's

1804
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,960
another coverage metric and but it's

1805
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,400
from the management perspective rather

1806
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,960
than the technology perspective

1807
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,480
where are we now in 2020 and forward

1808
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,359
uh because of cobin we're now looking at

1809
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,000
impact operations so we're going back to

1810
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,559
our operational risk uh colleagues who

1811
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,920
helped us with the gre grc to begin with

1812
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,599
and saying it takes us this long to

1813
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,119
recover from an incident and the

1814
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,960
business is saying well what does that

1815
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,240
mean for the business how much would

1816
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,240
that cost can we get a return on

1817
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,599
investment for doing more security by

1818
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,520
cost avoidance loss of what loss

1819
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,920
avoidance so loss avoidance is really

1820
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,160
how people measure return on investment

1821
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,039
and security and i thought any uh top

1822
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,960
topic on metrics would be remiss without

1823
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,520
talking about that topic

1824
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,200
conclusion

1825
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,720
i really do have to get rid of this guy

1826
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,520
anyway

1827
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,960
there we go

1828
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,760
um

1829
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
conclusion metrics necessarily reflect

1830
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
the underlying technology

1831
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
as our technology gets more complicated

1832
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,359
our metrics are getting more complicated

1833
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,720
we're getting more and more measures

1834
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,039
more and more ways to look at it

1835
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,520
so we are now

1836
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,440
forced with a situation where we keep

1837
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,480
adding and adding and adding metrics

1838
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,400
and we don't throw out any of the old

1839
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,280
technology that we've been using

1840
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,000
especially now with the the solar winds

1841
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,559
and the um the ransomware

1842
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,799
it seems like time maybe we go back to

1843
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,960
our engineering routes

1844
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,160
and

1845
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,480
re-engineer data flow and applications

1846
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,720
themselves to make them less dependent

1847
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,119
on 18 little boxes in the network and

1848
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,200
how we're managing them for performance

1849
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,319
and and

1850
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,200
control effectiveness that method is not

1851
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,359
working um it might not be working

1852
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,760
because people don't have the the cycles

1853
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,160
to measure it it might not be working

1854
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,680
because people don't have the cycles to

1855
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,799
fix it

1856
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,079
but it as a as a society

1857
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,319
we don't have the cycles to be doing

1858
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,240
this type of metrics activity at the grc

1859
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,160
level that i've been describing so we

1860
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,280
need to come up with something else

1861
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,680
and that's

1862
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,640
security metrics in a nutshell

1863
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,039
that's outstanding

1864
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,799
we've run a little bit over but it was

1865
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,000
worth it

1866
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,240
we've got uh an incredible uh

1867
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,720
tour of uh

1868
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,559
the whole space of metrics and

1869
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,079
management

1870
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,359
uh

1871
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,599
and and i especially like the fact that

1872
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,160
we're measuring more but perhaps not i'm

1873
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,359
not

1874
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,480
enjoying it as much

1875
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,720
never a dull moment i say in cyber

1876
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,000
security

1877
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,880
that's that's great um

1878
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,720
we're past the normal recording time

1879
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,400
here of the class

1880
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,559
uh but if you're willing to feel if

1881
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,400
anybody has a burning question that they

1882
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,839
want to ask

1883
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,599
um we can do that otherwise

1884
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,640
i i don't none have popped up i think i

1885
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,839
don't see a hand

1886
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,760
yeah i think there's so much information

1887
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,599
in what you presented

1888
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,200
um

1889
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,200
we could really

1890
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,039
spend quite quite a bit of time studying

1891
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,000
that

1892
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,119
and

1893
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,440
i'll i'll i'll just share with you here

1894
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,079
as a closing and see if anybody types

1895
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,119
anything

1896
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,039
uh purdue is home to

1897
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,160
the origin of software metrics

1898
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,200
generally

1899
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,280
not just security metrics but software

1900
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,039
software engineering

1901
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,720
and um

1902
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,119
the workshop that we held here actually

1903
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,039
kicked off mitre's

1904
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,559
decision to

1905
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,799
make the cde a

1906
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,000
community

1907
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,760
effort um

1908
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,599
i told you that you were behind this

1909
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,559
somewhere

1910
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:33,920
yeah

1911
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,640
it was it was an interest because of

1912
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,400
not so much the metrics aspect but the

1913
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,559
fact that we weren't able to share with

1914
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,319
each other confidently

1915
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,680
information about vulnerabilities to

1916
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,079
then be able to identify root cause and

1917
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,599
to eliminate them

1918
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,640
so we held a workshop here that

1919
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,520
both darpa and nist helped sponsor

1920
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:00,799
and

1921
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,799
from that workshop some minor folks

1922
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,839
attended and

1923
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,559
as a result of attending the workshop

1924
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,640
decided that the cbe project they've

1925
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,400
been working on internally should be

1926
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,480
something they could share wider

1927
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,680
uh in the community so a small

1928
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,880
small nexus here at purdue but uh

1929
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,280
we've been continuing to track

1930
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,520
track this area it's it's

1931
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,520
important to be able to say something

1932
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,920
about are we improving well how do we

1933
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,000
measure it

1934
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,599
that's a good tidbit and i encourage

1935
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,319
anyone else who has their own experience

1936
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,640
that does not seem to be highlighted

1937
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,520
although

1938
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,280
i i disclaimer you can't highlight

1939
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,359
everything in an hour presentation but

1940
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:44,799
if if there's something that i missed

1941
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,599
i'm happy to include it in the next one

1942
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,200
that's wonderful

1943
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,000
um

1944
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,160
we haven't any questions come up so i

1945
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,079
think people are

1946
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,760
either still digesting the information

1947
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,160
or you answered every possible question

1948
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,280
either way i think we'll close out now

1949
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,280
thank you so much it was a pleasure and

1950
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,880
it's just wonderful to have all this

1951
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,799
information and hopefully

1952
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,480
sometime in the not too distant future

1953
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,119
you can come visit us in person

1954
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,960
i would love to thank you look forward

1955
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,079
to that day

1956
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,839
thank you so much

1957
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,839
goodbye everyone and we'll see you uh

1958
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,119
next week

1959
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,119
bye

1960
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,039
you
