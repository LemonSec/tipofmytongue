to the serious uh

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
second uh 22nd security symposium and

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
the day two of that

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
outstanding event here

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
as we all know that cyber security has

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,479
always been important but increasingly

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
it is broader than before as a

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
cross-cutting topic uh it goes beyond

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,760
the traditional cyberspace and gets to

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
the interface between the virtual and

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
the physical as we say between

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,799
the atoms and the bytes between what we

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
code and what we touch

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,520
with even bigger implications to the

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,080
physical world that we live in such as

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
autonomous vehicles biomedical systems

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
infrastructure manufacturing supply

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
chain

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,439
and furthermore we know that

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,720
sirius

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
at purdue has a long and outstanding

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
history fostering interdisciplinary

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
research and education as well as

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
industry engagement and impact to

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
society

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
and these days as cyber security itself

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
evolves sirius has also under

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
outstanding leadership by don yena and

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
the team being able to adapt and to

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
augment

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,320
over into many different application

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
spaces

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
and going from theory to

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
development and all the way to standards

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,319
policy and law with tremendous

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
implications to

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
both learning and discovery mission here

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
at purdue

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
as the dean of college of engineering

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
i'm particularly pleased to know that

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
no fewer than 39 faculty members

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
from seven different engineering schools

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,519
in college

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
are affiliated with sirius and

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
furthermore three of the engineering

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
faculty members sit on the serious

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
research leadership board

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
and this shows the interdisciplinary

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
nature of collaboration

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,959
that is a hallmark of sirius

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
and they lead a lot of the

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
industry-sponsored or federally

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
sponsored research consortium

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,599
and

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,400
large-scale activities

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
and as the executive vice president for

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
a strategic initiative at the university

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,720
i have the utmost hope and optimism that

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
sirius will be a key pillar

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,440
in the continuation to contribute to

85
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,879
university-wide initiatives

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,680
in particular to national security and

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
technology one of the five pillars as

mentioned yesterday as well

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
and with the critical role of cyber and

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,680
the virtual physical interface

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
in the security area i know that

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680

not-for-profit company

189
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,280
our mission

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,680
is to solve problems for a safer world

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
and for public benefits

192
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,720
established in 1958

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
my major today manages six

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
ffrdc's

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,919
or federally funded research and

196
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
development centers

197
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
for u.s government agencies

198
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
ranging from national security

199
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
to health aviation

200
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
homeland security

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
and commerce

202
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,479
today

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,280
i would like to share with you

204
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
a various uh cyber initiatives

205
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
at mike

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,759
mitre

207
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
has a long history

208
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,640
in doing cyber work

209
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,120
we actually started uh pre-1970

210
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
um

211
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
and continued uh throughout the years

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
and so we have more than 50 years

213
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
of

214
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
working and contributing

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
in this

216
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
very important domain

217
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,560
from prior to and throughout 1970s

218
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
miter's work

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,200
focused on cyber security foundations

220
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
including

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
contributing to the aware report which

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,880
was commissioned by the defense science

223
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
board

224
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
and that report

225
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,160
discussed security controls for computer

226
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
systems

227
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
we also contributed to the anderson

228
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,240
report

229
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
that set the u.s

230
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
information security research agenda

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
for over a decade

232
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
and our work

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
involved

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
in prototype of highly secure systems

235
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
and we developed first criteria

236
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,880
for evaluating secure systems

237
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
as a precursor to trusted computer

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,680
security evaluation criteria

239
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
we developed first specification of a

240
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,800
trusted computing base

241
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,560
and also early biometric recognition

242
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,119
systems

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,720
in the 1990s

244
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
we expanded our work

245
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
to include

246
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
secure network systems and multi-level

247
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,040
security

248
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
and also engaged with commercial

249
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
industry

250
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,079
we co-authored many nsa rainbow serious

251
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,040
computer security guidelines

252
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
and helped to establish nsa's national

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
computer security center

254
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
also evaluated

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
commercial products

256
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,560
under the national computer security

257
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,600
center

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
trusted

259
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
product evaluation program

260
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
and developed

261
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
secure

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,000
windowed workstation and one of the very

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,040
first secure database management systems

264
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,079
in the 1990s

265
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
we

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
expanded our work to include defending

267
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
against the broad attacks

268
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,760
and the creation of

269
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
and deployment of

270
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
joint worldwide intelligence

271
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
communication system or jrex

272
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
which is used today

273
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
and

274
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
operations and intel workstations

275
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
minor intrusion analysis system

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,079
or midas

277
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,519
which is an early security information

278
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,519
and event management system

279
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
we created uh cbe

280
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
the common vulnerability and exposures

281
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
database and

282
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,079
i ic

283
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,240
intelligent community and dod pki

284
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
stood up of multiple early stocks

285
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,639
and co-funded

286
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,800
of journal of computer security

287
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,680
in the 2000s

288
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
we

289
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,839
addressed advanced persistent threat

290
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,079
and started developing

291
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,120
cyber

292
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
threat intelligence

293
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,839
and both in terms of the framework and

294
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
in terms of its content

295
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,000
so we created and deployed

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
insider threat detection

297
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
called illicit

298
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
and we developed crypto protocol shape

299
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,200
and analyzer

300
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
multi-domain dissemination

301
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,959
system

302
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,720
and very first

303
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,519
honey client

304
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,880
we also

305
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,600
established a malware technical exchange

306
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,959
meeting

307
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,040
in the early 2000s

308
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,839
recognizing the importance of engaging

309
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,399
the community and sharing what we know

310
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
and we developed and published the first

311
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,839
book on privacy for us government

312
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,880
and engaged in risk management framework

313
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,079
um guide the policies and guidance

314
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,600
governance work

315
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,079
and also security automation standards

316
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,880
so such as

317
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
open vulnerability assessment language

318
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,279
common weakness enumeration

319
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,160
and common attack pattern enumeration

320
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,319
and classification

321
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,880
then in the last decade

322
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,079
we expanded our work to address

323
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,480
cyber securities in mobile computing

324
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
and

325
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
heightened our work in cyber resiliency

326
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
and cyber threat intelligence

327
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,399
we launched

328
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,800
our pub publicly launched uh our

329
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
main

330
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
flagship attack framework

331
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
which

332
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
is a knowledge base of adversary ttps or

333
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
tactics techniques and procedures

334
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
and to help the community to help the

335
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,440
cyber defenders

336
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
understand adversarial

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
behaviors

338
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,519
we developed caldera which is an

339
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,880
illumination of engine

340
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
for people to gain understanding

341
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,279
of how adversaries

342
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,639
attack our networks

343
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
we established a number of cyber

344
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
resiliency initiatives

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,040
and contributed to nist's guidance on

346
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,519
developing cyber resilient systems

347
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
and this is also the decade

348
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
where

349
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,800
we saw the establishment of very first

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,959

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
and authoritative works

361
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
on

362
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,160
cyber security operation centers

363
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,959
and deception

364
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,480
now

365
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
in the very current century

366
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
we're just i'm sorry decade in the

367
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
current decade

368
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,040
riders

369
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
cyber capability

370
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,920
encompasses

371
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
a large spectrum

372
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,839
ranging from

373
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,399
underlying underpinning technology

374
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
enablers

375
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360
to

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,040
architecture and engineering concepts of

377
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,399
systems

378
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,640
as well as enabling cyber operations and

379
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,799
effects

380
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
today we have

381
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,119
more than

382
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,839
1500 cyber security engineers and

383
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
professionals working

384
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,880
to

385
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
address our sponsors needs

386
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,199
and to realize broader and deeper

387
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,319
impact

388
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,320
in our sponsors missions

389
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,320
so now let me go into some details uh in

390
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
some selected areas

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
cloud security well of course everyone

392
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,160
is moving into the cloud

393
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,919
and government

394
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
also migrated into cloud

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,160
so

396
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,520
we worked across the federal government

397
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
to secure sensitive data

398
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
and applications in public and private

399
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
clouds

400
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
we engaged in

401
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
secure design

402
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
access point and

403
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,760
hubs and uh cloud posting

404
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
and and threat mitigation

405
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
as well as private and hybrid cr

406
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
cloud shared vulnerability aspects of

407
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,679
work

408
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,880
and provided the foundations

409
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
that

410
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
enabled government

411
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
and private

412
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
sectors to work together utilizing the

413
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,039
cloud

414
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,600
to carry out their missions

415
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
and their functions

416
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
we also conduct cyber assessments

417
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
through tabletops and exercises

418
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
uh looking at vulnerabilities

419
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,320
post

420
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
uh at our systems

421
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,440
or

422
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
our sponsors systems right and and and

423
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,960
companies systems and looking at uh

424
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,760
architectures

425
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,280
and also doing adversarial testing

426
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
and do

427
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,000
security testing and application testing

428
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
that's across the federal

429
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
government agencies

430
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,280
including dod and intelligence

431
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,559
communities

432
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,360
as well as private sectors cyber

433
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
assessments

434
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
we pioneered cyber resiliency

435
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,840
a concept

436
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
to support

437
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
federal government's uh mission

438
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,360
and we looked at cyber resiliency

439
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
from

440
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,039
holistic

441
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
end-to-end

442
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,559
needs

443
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,320
as well as looking at

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,679
how we prioritize to against

445
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
high-end

446
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,240
sophisticated adversaries and

447
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
nation-state actors

448
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
so we approach this

449
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
from adversary driven

450
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
point of view

451
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,280
implemented threat-based defense

452
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
and key resiliency principles

453
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
to ensure

454
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
mission can be carried out

455
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,480
in the face of a cyber attack

456
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
we also

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,679
engaged in

458
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,039
cyber security work

459
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
sorry cyber safety work

460
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,039
and one of our focuses is on

461
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,640
medical device

462
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
and tele health

463
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
safety

464
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
and so because

465
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
a lot of these uh

466
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,679
medical devices nowadays

467
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,960
are

468
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
powered with data and computation and

469
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,840
also communication

470
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,200
so we looked at the cyber safety threat

471
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
we developed the modeling for such kind

472
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
of cyber safety threat

473
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,039
posed to medical devices diagnostic

474
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,600
equipment

475
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,200
and also

476
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,080
the medical iot

477
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,799
concept framework

478
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,840
and conducted the cyber safety analysis

479
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,360
with

480
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,320
all the goals is to minimize harm to

481
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
public safety and human life

482
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
from system failure due to cyber attack

483
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,720
by evolving cyber threats

484
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,120
we also addressed enterprise security

485
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,360
architecture

486
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
looking at

487
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
cloud

488
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,280
as well as our organic network

489
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,240
um our software

490
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,360
and our

491
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
data

492
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,520
and end-to-end operations

493
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,880
throughout

494
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
these

495
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,520
kind of composition of systems and and

496
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,799
capabilities pulling data from multiple

497
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
places distributed

498
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,000
through cloud doing computing

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,720
and and looking at the

500
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
infrastructure security services

501
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,000
from a layered defense point of view

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
and we defined and integrated end-to-end

503
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
security and resiliency

504
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
this is a work so identify identity

505
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
credential and access management has

506
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
been there for a long time

507
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,720
we continue to work in this area and

508
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,919
continue to evolve advanced cyber

509
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
technologies for this and because our

510
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,799
computing

511
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,039
our systems continue to evolve

512
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,320
and

513
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
the attack are continuing to evolve as

514
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
well and so we are looking at

515
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
digital identity assurance

516
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,679
and we're looking at how to

517
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,039
govern that

518
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,799
we are looking at

519
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,720
continuous and multi-factor

520
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,200
authentication uh as well as

521
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
new novel

522
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
ideas on how to

523
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
achieve

524
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
those

525
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
new ways of to do identity credential

526
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
and access management

527
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,080
in the federated environment

528
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
and we

529
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
so that we can develop

530
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,480
solutions to ensure scalable

531
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,000
interoperable

532
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
and federated capabilities

533
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
fiber has become an integral part of our

534
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,000
lives from everyday living

535
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to medical care

536
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
to transportation whether personal

537
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
vehicle or via public transportation

538
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,760
to industrial production to operational

539
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,840
technologies and utilities

540
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,799
so cyber connects human data

541
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,159
communications networking and physical

542
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
functions together

543
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
because of that

544
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,600
we are also addressing

545
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,799
cyber security issues and developing

546
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,400
capabilities for internet of things and

547
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
cyber physical

548
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
systems security

549
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,360
our focus has been on um

550
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,720
operational technology security so it's

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,520
ot security operations right

552
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
and and ot

553
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,639
cyber resilience

554
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
ot cyber analytics and ot cyber

555
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,279
assessment

556
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,840
as well as industrial control systems

557
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
and scada

558
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,200
protection

559
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,120
in avionics

560
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
in vehicles

561
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
in

562
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,200
manufacturing

563
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,080
in medical devices

564
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,799
security is another

565
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,400
critical

566
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
capability

567
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,720
we have all experienced

568
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
in particular

569
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,440
during the pandemic

570
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
working remotely

571
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,640
connecting with our co-workers with our

572
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
colleagues with our family with our

573
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
peers

574
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,480
via mobile devices

575
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,279
so it is critical

576
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,360
that

577
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,240
we

578
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,960
have capabilities to address mobile

579
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
security

580
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,559
and also i believe our experience

581
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,679
during this pandemic working remotely

582
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,640
via mobile computing

583
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
will shed new light

584
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,799
on

585
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,440
possibilities for future work structure

586
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
so this is

587
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
an important area

588
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,720
miter is focusing on

589
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
so we developed threat models

590
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,200
particularly for mobile devices

591
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
and we looked at app

592
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
security

593
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
and we look at

594
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,320
the

595
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,799
threat intelligence

596
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,600
for mobile in other words attack

597
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
homework

598
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,120
so understanding

599
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
adversary behavior

600
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
against

601
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
mobile devices

602
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
we are also looking at

603
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,840
the security architecture for mobile

604
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
devices

605
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
another integral part of of cyber

606
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
security is privacy

607
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,320
and particularly with

608
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,200
all these interconnected world data

609
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,159
being shared being pulled from various

610
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,399
different places

611
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,240
and so we are

612
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
looking at new models

613
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
to

614
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
address privacy

615
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
looking at from

616
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
technological

617
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,000
approaches as well as from government's

618
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,440
issues and management issues

619
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
automation is the key

620
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
as we move into the future

621
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,080
so we are looking at uh end-to-end

622
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
enterprise-wide

623
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,200
secure automation and management

624
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,480
and also creating the devsecops

625
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
environment

626
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,679
to enable

627
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
development deployment of those secure

628
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,360
systems

629
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,720
another

630
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,799
role minor place is really contributing

631
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,399
to the development

632
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,159
of a strategy and governance for cyber

633
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,640
security

634
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,760
recent

635
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,640
president's executive orders

636
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
um

637
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,200
on cyber security really highlighted the

638
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,640
importance

639
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,760
of policy governance

640
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,480
implementation plans and risk management

641
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
so we are working with our government

642
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,360
sponsors hand in hand

643
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,480
informed with our knowledge

644
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
in atlas serious

645
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
behavior and in

646
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,440
technology possibilities

647
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,159
we are providing advice

648
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
to our government sponsors

649
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,760
at a very foundational level

650
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
we are developing

651
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,039
crypto

652
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,240
and trust

653
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
as the foundation right for our

654
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
computing

655
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,840
and software assurance

656
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
and in particular we have been looking

657
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,080
at post quantum crypto techniques

658
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
given the

659
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
uh

660
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
potential future of quantum computing

661
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
and we're looking at how to improve

662
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,039
crypto protocol

663
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,279
and algorithms

664
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,679
and also

665
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,640
combining formal methods

666
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,080
and uh

667
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,000
machine learning uh and and ai

668
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
would like to use that term

669
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
to look at how we address

670
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,960
the software assurance piece

671
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
earlier i mentioned

672
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
we also

673
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,600
in gay are engaged in enabling

674
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
cyber operations

675
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,360
and so this is really building upon

676
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,159
the technologies i had just

677
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,519
highlighted

678
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,919
as well as our

679
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,760
trust partnership

680
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
with our sponsors

681
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,799
and so we are

682
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,679
engineering solutions

683
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,960
that

684
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,399
work in

685
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
real world

686
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,840
operations to support

687
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,799
our

688
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,360
sponsors

689
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,120
a few key components

690
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,919
that we are working on to enable cyber

691
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,519
operations

692
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,640
uh include cyber threat intelligence and

693
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,080
sharing

694
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,519
i mentioned attack framework so attack

695
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,840
framework

696
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,760
provides a knowledge base for

697
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
adversaries tpp

698
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,480
and and it's

699
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,559
publicly available um and globally

700
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,480
accessible

701
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,440
to help people understand

702
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,039
how adversarials are conducting their

703
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,399
intrusion

704
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,840
uh and we're freely sharing that

705
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,080
with the public and with our sponsors

706
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,559
we also

707
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,799
provide cyber data analytics

708
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,760
and malware analysis and detection

709
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
capabilities

710
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
and that is another piece

711
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,559
of enabling

712
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,480
the cyber

713
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,480
operations

714
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,519
we also

715
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,000
developed

716
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
a platform

717
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,120
that allow us

718
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,320
to do cyber adversary emulation

719
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
um so this is where

720
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
um

721
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
defenders

722
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
can test

723
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,200
and emulate

724
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,960
how

725
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,840
adversary will traverse

726
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,600
into an organ organization's network

727
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
and understand

728
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,640
what might be the key vulnerabilities

729
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,559
and then where to

730
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,840
provide defense measures

731
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,159
another piece important piece

732
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,279
for cyber protection is really the

733
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,600
cyber detector deception

734
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,639
and adversary engagement

735
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,440
we have developed

736
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
a platform that's also publicly

737
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
available

738
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,760
on mitre's website

739
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,840
it's called

740
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,919
engage which lays out a graph on

741
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
how to deploy

742
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,960
various deception mechanisms

743
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,880
and how to provide

744
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,559
country measures

745
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,560
to proactively engage with the adversary

746
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,239
that that are in your network

747
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,560
cyber forensics is an important

748
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,560
component

749
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,918
to develop attribution

750
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,078
to

751
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,240
analyze digital evidence

752
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,839
so we have a program focused on that

753
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,480
we also

754
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
look at reverse engineering

755
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,280
and set cyber effects

756
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,159
so that's combining managed attribution

757
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,119
and

758
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
forensics as well as the understanding

759
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,520
of the cyber infrastructure

760
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,078
intended cyber effects

761
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
now let me uh

762
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,119
change my uh

763
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,119
description description little bit to

764
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
focus on

765
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,680
informing you of a recently established

766
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,280
entity unit at mitre it's called minor

767
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
ingenuity

768
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,119
and because we recognized that

769
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,160
we will need

770
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,520
cross-sector collaboration

771
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
in order to really address the toughest

772
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,280
technological challenges

773
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
mitre has

774
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,800
been operating ffrdc's in support of the

775
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
federal government

776
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,079
and we realized we also

777
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,280
need to

778
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
build a bridge between the public sector

779
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
and the private sector

780
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,480
hence

781
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,680
minor ingenuity was born a little over a

782
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,000
year ago

783
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
micro ingenuity collaborates

784
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
with the private sector

785
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,320
on challenges

786
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,520
that

787
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,400
demand public interest solutions

788
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
so so far

789
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,359
in the past a little over a year we have

790
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,119
been focused on

791
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,960
cyber security

792
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,800
health care effectiveness

793
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,880
microelectronics quantum sensing

794
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,839
and

795
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,640
communications

796
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,680
so i will highlight

797
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,839
a few

798
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,760
um activities by

799
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,480
minor ingenuity in cyber security

800
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
so we established

801
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,480
center for threat informed defense or

802
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
seated

803
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
which is our

804
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,839
membership powered privately funded

805
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,440
research and development initiative

806
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
it creates derivative knowledge

807
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,599
in threat informed defense

808
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,440
leveraging

809
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
attack capabilities

810
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,839
we also created miter attack

811
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,160
defender or mad

812
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,720
as our training platform

813
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,560
that

814
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,359
leverages our engineers

815
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,400
knowledge of attack framework

816
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,280
and

817
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,760
knowledge of cyber

818
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,880
security technologies

819
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
to train

820
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,599
broadly you know anyone who who would

821
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,640
like to

822
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,520
uh

823
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,160
understand how to do how to carry out

824
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,200
attack how to analyze how to defend the

825
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,680
network can take this training

826
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
threat

827
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
so

828
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
in so doing we would

829
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,880
bring the cyber postures

830
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,839
up

831
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,760
from broadly

832
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,200
with all the sectors

833
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,839
and this was

834
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,359
launched in spring

835
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,079
2021

836
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,320
and we also conduct

837
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,960
attack evaluations

838
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,359
for any enterprise

839
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,440
who would like help

840
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,960
to evaluate their cyber postures their

841
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,760
cybernet their network cyber postures

842
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,320
we help them and we conduct attacking

843
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
so seated as i mentioned center for

844
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
threat informed

845
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,119
uh defense

846
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,920
is a membership powered

847
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,079
uh privately funded

848
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,119
center

849
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,720
and we

850
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,400
through situate

851
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,320
we have realized three times of the uh

852
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,400
ind investment

853
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,200
and

854
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,079
collaborated with leaders in threat

855
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,040
informed defense across industry

856
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,920
around the world

857
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,400
and very quickly

858
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
because due to sea kit

859
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,040
we have

860
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,920
extended our impact

861
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,960
uh in attack

862
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
for advanced defense

863
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,920
defense of cyber operations all of these

864
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,640
are extensions of our attack

865
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,720
capabilities through this partnership

866
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
matt as i mentioned

867
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,839
is our training platform

868
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,520
and we're providing

869
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,880
certification and training

870
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
for our broader community

871
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,440
to

872
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,400
up their skills

873
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
and we also conduct

874
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
the

875
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,880
attack evaluation uh and let me just

876
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,760
quickly move to uh in the interest of

877
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,200
time um

878
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
so one year

879
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,560
after we established uh mitre ingenuity

880
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,759
we have already

881
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
engaged more than 65

882
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,520
industry organizations

883
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,119
to advance our mission and together to

884
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,359
advance our nation's

885
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,960
cyber security posture

886
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
looking to the future

887
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,760
informed

888
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,560
with global mega megatrends and threat

889
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,960
landscape

890
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,319
mitre

891
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,920
aims

892
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,119
to make cyberspace resilient

893
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,400
in order to promote cyber technologies

894
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
for the well-being of the public while

895
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,640
suppressing malicious exploitations

896
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,040
while addressing two key challenges

897
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,680
reduce adversaries ability to steal

898
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
american id

899
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,200
and secure

900
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,560
and deter

901
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,440
exploitation of u.s critical

902
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,240
infrastructure

903
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,040
you have all seen

904
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,680
various uh uh thefts

905
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,560
of u.s intellectual properties those are

906
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
all in the news so i don't really need

907
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,839
to go

908
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,680
over them

909
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
what we are doing

910
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,119
in addressing this particular cyber

911
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,599
challenge

912
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,119
is to look at one how do we drive up the

913
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,160
cost

914
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,680
so here our open research challenges are

915
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,319
can we detect disrupt

916
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,280
malign insider threat

917
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,720
that's within our organizations

918
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,319
and how can companies establish trusted

919
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,720
supply chain partners

920
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,800
and visibility from end to end

921
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,520
are there creative ways to limit

922
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,319
disclosure across partners

923
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,720
and can carriers deploy

924
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,680
network

925
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,119
changes that significantly inhibit

926
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,079
exploitation

927
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,839
secondly we're looking at

928
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,960
how can we drive down the value to the

929
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
adversary

930
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,760
so

931
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,119
here are some open research challenges

932
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,599
can we fingerprint technologies so

933
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,599
stolen ip can be reused

934
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,839
can representative deception as a

935
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,520
service be deployed for smaller less

936
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,880
sophisticated organizations

937
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,079
how do organizations know ground truth

938
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,040
from the misinformation

939
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,599
what non-cyber activities

940
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,200
can be coupled

941
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,040
to achieve our objective

942
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
and thirdly

943
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,520
how do we do this at school

944
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,359
and we also have a number of research

945
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,160
challenges in order to scale this up

946
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,640
for the key challenge

947
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,079
to secure and deter exploitation of u.s

948
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,640
critical infrastructure the motivation

949
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
is there and we have seen the recent

950
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,599
attacks

951
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,599
our primary focus right now

952
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
is on energy sector

953
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,839
healthcare and public health

954
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,560
our secondary focus on the critical

955
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
infrastructure

956
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,000
is on transportation systems financial

957
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,200
systems

958
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,520
and services and emergency services

959
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,119
and we are also

960
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,839
looking at the potential of

961
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,480
addressing critical manufacturing

962
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,960
water and waste to water systems

963
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,520
nuclear reactors materials and waste

964
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,400
we are speeding up

965
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,000
our efforts

966
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
on critical infrastructure cyber

967
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
protection

968
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,200
last month

969
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,119
we have launched

970
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,400
a new innovation center within microlabs

971
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,599
it's called

972
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,400
critical infrastructure protection

973
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,119
innovation center

974
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,599
and so we are focused on protecting

975
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,920
mission-critical infrastructure from

976
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,440
cyber threats in operational technology

977
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,760
and mixed itot environments

978
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,520
and we're doing so

979
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,160
by a partnership with government and

980
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,359
industry

981
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,160
to assess vulnerabilities

982
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,079
to develop and test

983
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,000
resilience approaches

984
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,760
to prototype

985
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,200
defensive technologies

986
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,480
and to mature

987
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,880
and prototype advanced detection

988
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,800
response recovery concept

989
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,640
in closing

990
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,119
i would like to make you aware of our

991
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,319
cyber new professional program

992
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,760
we are looking for

993
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,640
talents in this area

994
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,440
and so please take a look at mitre's

995
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,839
website on our cyber new professional

996
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,760
program and join us

997
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,560
to

998
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,319
have

999
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,480
broad impact

1000
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,800
to protect our nation

1001
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,760
from

1002
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,119
malicious

1003
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,680
exploitations and attack

1004
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,440
in cyberspace

1005
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,839
thank you very much

1006
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,319
thank you dr masters thank you for your

1007
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,720
keynote speech giving us a great

1008
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,760
overview of mitre's vision and action in

1009
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
the space of cyber

1010
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
i wonder if you might have maybe a

1011
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,400
couple of more minutes to take uh maybe

1012
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,480
a couple of quick questions i understand

1013
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,880
that it is already 12 18

1014
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,800
p.m

1015
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,319
maybe one question sure okay so uh one

1016
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,920
of the uh so this is a question from the

1017
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,480
audience we have been working with mitre

1018
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,119
for over 20 years and several of our

1019
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,839
purdue graduates have worked at mitre so

1020
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,640
what are some of the non-obvious topics

1021
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,119
you will advise our students to focus on

1022
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,839
to be successful at an organization such

1023
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,000
as minor

1024
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,400
non-obvious topics yeah like because we

1025
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,559
know that cyber is important and you

1026
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,520
know a lot of the uh yeah

1027
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,200
so what what are some of the none of

1028
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,919
well let's see

1029
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,559
i think

1030
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,839
cyber space is very broad right and uh

1031
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,359
since uh many of the purdue students

1032
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,920
uh and also faculty members have been

1033
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
working with major and and familiar with

1034
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
uh some of our missions um and some of

1035
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,960
our developments right

1036
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,480
um and

1037
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
i think

1038
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,040
using that as a base

1039
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,160
extracting into the future

1040
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,599
looking at

1041
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,160
where some of those threats future

1042
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,960
threats might evolve into

1043
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,200
and look at

1044
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,160
new ways new approaches

1045
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,520
to provide for example

1046
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,839
software assurance right

1047
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,559
how do we reimagine

1048
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,520
the software assurance piece

1049
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
and is it

1050
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,240
just building from ground up based on

1051
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,920
formal methods or is it some of the

1052
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,559
approaches uh current state of the art

1053
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,520
out there

1054
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,119
combining

1055
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,680
um formal methods with some machine

1056
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,359
learning capabilities right

1057
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,920
so what would the next step be

1058
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,800
and i think another area um this is my

1059
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,119
personal opinion would be

1060
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
looking into um

1061
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,280
how do we

1062
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,480
do crypto

1063
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,599
yeah whether or not it's supposed

1064
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,960
quantum right

1065
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
and and on on in the current environment

1066
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
what are some of the out of box kind of

1067
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,680
thinking

1068
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,640
to to do that

1069
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,440
as well as you know heterogeneous

1070
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,720
systems

1071
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,400
how do we

1072
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
dynamically compose those

1073
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,960
and yet provide

1074
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,319
cyber resiliency

1075
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,079
great well thank you again dr masters
