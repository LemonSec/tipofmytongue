today is a officially a reading day for

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,960
the university

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
so if you're one of the students thank

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,400
you as well for taking some time to show

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,199
up

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
and for everybody who's tuning in if you

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
haven't tuned into one of these before

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,199
we have

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
um several hundred

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
talks by notables that are in our

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,760
library and available

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
and this is the latest in the line of

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
those

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
we're really pleased to have speaking

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,879
today

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
corey dakaro who's

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559
well it's hard to describe him in in

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,680
just a few words

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,200
he's a novelist he's a futurist he is a

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,399
fierce advocate for

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,360
issues of pride privacy and freedoms

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,520
he's associated with the eff

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
he has a long history of saying

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,000
provocative things

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
and that's one of the reasons we invited

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,479
him to speak this afternoon so

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,280
corey please take it away right whenever

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,000
someone

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
louds my ability to say provocative

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
things i'm tempted to go like

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
yup yours but now i'll forbear and carry

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
on with the with the talk so thank you

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,360
very much it's a

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
pleasure and an honor uh to be at purdue

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
to be speaking to staff students

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
um so i'm gonna talk today i'm to throw

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,040
up some slides here hang on one second

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
ah that's it all right so you can see

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,200
the slides i take it

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
i get it great great so i wanted

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,040
to talk today about the role of

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,040
technologists in both

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
creating and solving problems with

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
technology

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
and there's a there's a a salience to

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
that question today because

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
there's a real contest for

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,040
the posterity of the people who started

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,799
what you might call the cyber rights

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,560
movement organizations like the

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
electronic frontier foundation

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
and and the people who were early

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
champions of the internet

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
and the the kind of burgeoning majority

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
report on those

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
people is that they were blind techno

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,560
optimists

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
they thought that you know if you could

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
just connect everyone everything else

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
would be fine

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
and i think that's a myth in fact i know

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
it's a myth because i knew those people

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
but i want to demonstrate to you that it

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,239
was a myth

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
i mean starting from this simple

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
rational proposition

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
that you don't start an organization

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
like the electronic frontier foundation

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
because you think everything is going to

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,000
be fine if you think everything is going

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,319
to be fine you just go off and enjoy the

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
the the ride you start in an

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,000
organization like the electronic

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,519
frontier foundation because on the one

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
hand you have to be very excited

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,480
about what might go right and on the

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,040
other hand

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
you you have to have a really keen

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
appreciation of how it might all go

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
wrong

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
um you know the motto of of that early

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
cyber liberties movement i don't think

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,800
was this is all just going to be great

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,280
it's

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
this is all going to be great if we

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,640
don't screw it up

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
and if we do it's going to be terrible

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,080
so

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
before computing was a source of stock

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,599
bubbles

94
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,519
and wealth it was a passion and the

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,040
people who got involved with computing

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,319
got involved with it

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,319
not because they were dreaming of riches

98
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,440
but because they couldn't help

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,519
themselves

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
and to understand where that passion

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
comes from i've spent a lot of time

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
interrogating myself because i'm

103
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,159
one of those people um you i think it's

104
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
it's worthwhile to consider a kind of

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
notional journey

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
of a programmer that that you start off

107
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
your career by writing your first ever

108
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
successful program

109
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
when you write a program you express

110
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,239
your will

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,200
with sufficient precision and crispness

112
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
that the computer can correctly

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
interpret it

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
and then it can repeat your will

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
effectively infinitely

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,599
and effectively for free and then

117
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
when you uh when you connect that

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
computer that your code is running on

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
to a modem to a network that code can

120
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,439
kind of slither all over the world

121
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
and anyone who has the same problem as

122
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
you or anyone who's delighted by the

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
same

124
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,680
things as you can run that code

125
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,478
and it's a profound difference from the

126
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,280
kind of sharing that predated code

127
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
i mean people have made recipes for a

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
long time and training materials for a

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
long time

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
but the idea of a machine that you could

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
imbue with your will

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
and that would then project that will

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
around the world it's not like a recipe

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
for your grandmother's perfect brownies

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
it's like a self-executing brownie

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
recipe it's like a brownie replicator

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
that lands in the offices and basement

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,479
rooms of everyone who's got one of those

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
primitive pcs and just pumps out

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
brownies for as long as they type run

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
and hit return

142
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
and once you have projected your will

143
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,840
around the world once you've found the

144
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,759
people who want to run your code and

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
and have interests that are co-terminal

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
with your own another amazing thing

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,800
happens

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
which is that you discover people who

149
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
are in a community with you a community

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
you didn't even know you needed

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,360
communities of people who know the words

152
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
for things that you felt but never been

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
able to express

154
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
communities that um know uh about things

155
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
that you didn't even know you were

156
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
interested in and then when you

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
discover them you're like how is it that

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
i live my life without knowing about

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
this thing that will be my passion

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
from here on out and all three of those

161
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
activities writing code sharing code and

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,639
discovering communities

163
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
they could all be broadly grouped as a

164
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
self-determination right figuring out

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,840
how you want to

166
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
live your life and then living your life

167
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,280
that way

168
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
and the source of all of our computer

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
conflicts from the earliest days

170
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
have some really important nexus with

171
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,199
self-determination so the the

172
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,319
uh most famous early conflict over

173
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,440
computing

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
was the day richard stallman walked into

175
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
the lab at mit at into the ai lab and

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
didn't like the way the printer worked

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
and tried to open the drawer with the

178
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,639
paper tape with the printer driver on it

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
and found a lock on the drawer

180
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
and got into an argument about whether

181
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
or not he could change the program on

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,199
the paper tape

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
was told that that wasn't the way we do

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
things around the me around the ai lab

185
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
at mit anymore

186
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,400
and um he got so angry that he invented

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,639
the free software movement

188
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,639
and and it wasn't just the locked roar

189
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
that pattern repeats itself

190
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
and repeats itself infamously one day

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
bill gates uh got summoned to ibm

192
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,479
to see if he if they were interested in

193
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,120
buying his

194
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
dos program for their new pcs that they

195
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
were making

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
and uh around that same time he got very

197
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,319
angry

198
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,759
at his colleagues at the homebrew

199
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,759
computer club who were accustomed to

200
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
taking the code that they'd all written

201
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
and sharing it around and altering it

202
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
and sharing it with other hobbyists and

203
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,599
improving it and just sort of

204
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,039
sticking it all in the hopper and see

205
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,520
what fell out making sure not not

206
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
uh making themselves uh uh

207
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
hostage to whatever technology decisions

208
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
some other member of the club had made

209
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
but rather being able to override those

210
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
decisions when they were doing their own

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,479
computing

212
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,639
and then the first network fights were

213
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,280
also about self-determination

214
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
so before we had the web we had usenet

215
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
and usenet was the thing we used to

216
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
argue with each other and talk with each

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
other on the internet and

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
it was a series of distributed message

219
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
boards that ran over a protocol called

220
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
uucp

221
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
and uh the hosting for this was

222
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
primarily done by

223
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
a group of technologists who

224
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,680
semi-seriously semi-jokingly call

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
themselves the backbone cabal

226
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
and the backbone cabal all worked at

227
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
large research government and military

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,879
institutions

229
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
that generated phone bills every month

230
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,960
that were thousands of pages long

231
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
and so they could bury usenet all those

232
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
calls that their computers were making

233
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,639
in the phone bills and no one would

234
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
notice but the backbone cabal had a

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,319
pretty rational fear which was that

236
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
someday their bosses would figure out

237
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
what they were doing

238
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,199
or more worryingly someone in congress

239
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,960
which ultimately funded a lot of this

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,360
stuff

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,280
would figure out what they were doing

242
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
and if there was stuff going on on

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,759
usenet

244
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
beyond frivolous arguments about star

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,039
trek or

246
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,759
sharing tips about how to groom your cat

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,919
if there was pornography or pirated

248
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,120
software or

249
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,080
other material that uh might excite the

250
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,400
uh

251
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
the passions of uh someone on congress

252
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,799
looking for something to grandstand on

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,080
that that would be the end of the whole

254
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,559
project and so the backbone cabal had a

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
a funny way of running itself

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
whenever someone wanted to add a new

257
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
discussion group to usenet

258
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
they would hold a vote and if the vote

259
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,519
uh

260
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
was found a majority of votes in favor

261
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
of starting that group it was started

262
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
unless the backbone cabal didn't want it

263
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
in which case they would veto it

264
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720
and uh there was a uh a cookery

265
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
enthusiast

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
who wanted a cookery group and he wanted

267
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
it under the wreck hierarchy for a

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
recreational activity

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
and the backbone cabal in the manner of

270
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
all people who exercise power without

271
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
accountability

272
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
decided that not only were they going to

273
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
exercise their veto to keep pornography

274
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,640
off of their network

275
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
they were also going to exercise their

276
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
veto to ensure that cookery only went

277
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,120
under the talk

278
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
category and not the recreational

279
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
category

280
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
and this kicked off a fight that was so

281
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,839
intense

282
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,320
that it resulted in in john gilmore and

283
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
a few friends

284
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
founding an alternative set of

285
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
infrastructure to to use net

286
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
called the alt hierarchy where anyone

287
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,279
could start any news group without the

288
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
backbone cabal interfering

289
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
and within a year or two it was larger

290
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
than all of usenet it had been eclipsed

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
by the spite usenet

292
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
that had been built and the very first

293
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
news group in

294
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
that spite usenet was alt dot gourmand

295
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
uh cookery group that went where the

296
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
person who wanted to put it

297
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,600
put it so that self-determination could

298
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
be exercised

299
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
now in the years since those fights some

300
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
of the worst nightmares of those early

301
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
digital activists have come to pass

302
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,360
we have got total penetration of

303
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
technology

304
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
and we have centralization surveillance

305
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
and manipulation to go with it

306
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
how was it that these early digital

307
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
freedom

308
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
activists were dealt such a stinging

309
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
defeat what was their blind spot

310
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
how did they miss that dystopia was a

311
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
possible outcome

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,160
of putting a computer first on every

313
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
desk and then in every pocket

314
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
and i don't think they missed it at all

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
i think they absolutely appreciated that

316
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
dystopia was one of the possible

317
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
outcomes

318
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
maybe even a likely one and one that

319
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,399
they were very exercised about and

320
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,399
determined to stave off

321
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
but they did have a blind spot and that

322
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
blind spot was monopoly

323
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
and i want to explain how it is

324
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,800
technologists could have

325
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
mistaken technology for an intrinsically

326
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
competitive industry

327
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
where there would be lots of choice and

328
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
where firms that

329
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
exercised their authority unwisely to

330
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
the detriment of their users

331
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,600
would find themselves put in a business

332
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,160
so

333
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
the early commercial internet was very

334
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
dynamic every year in those early years

335
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
companies that had been soaring high

336
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
even companies that were household names

337
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
in the technology world

338
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
would be toppled by upstarts and then

339
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,399
those upstarts would be toppled

340
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
themselves a year or two later

341
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
one after another after another it

342
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,720
seemed like there was this dynamism

343
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
in the network that was intrinsic

344
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
somehow to technology and it's true that

345
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
technology

346
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
has some intrinsic dynamism built into

347
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
it thanks to some factors i'll talk

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,399
about a little later

349
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
but the main thing that contributed to

350
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
the uh to the dynamism of technology in

351
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
those early days was not

352
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
the formal characteristics of technology

353
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
not touring completeness and

354
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,639
underlying compatibility it was the

355
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,120
department of justice

356
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
so uh i'm 49 years old

357
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
i got my first apple ii plus in 1979

358
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,399
when i was eight years old

359
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,760
and uh in 1983 i got a modem

360
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
and i got online and the reason i got a

361
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:07,839
modem

362
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,440
the reason i got online the reason that

363
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,959
there were bbs's

364
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
popping up all over the world

365
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
particularly in

366
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
in north america particularly in the

367
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
united states and

368
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
the reason that modems got really cheap

369
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,680
was that att had been broken up in 1982

370
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
an att's major project prior to 1982 was

371
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
keeping people from having modems

372
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
because telecoms operators are addicted

373
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
to something you might call the urinary

374
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
tract infection business model

375
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
that's the idea where instead of value

376
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,040
flowing in a nice healthy gush

377
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
it comes out in a painful dribble so if

378
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
you want to make a long-distance call

379
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,880
that'll cost you something hell if you

380
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,160
want caller id

381
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
if you want to know who's calling you

382
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
before you pick up the phone that'll

383
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
cost you something too imagine if email

384
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
worked like caller id

385
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
where you could open the message and

386
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
read it but if you wanted to find out

387
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,040
who it was from

388
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
or see the subject line before you

389
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
opened it you'd have to pay your email

390
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
provider 295 a month

391
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
for email or id the carriers understood

392
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
correctly that if you were a um

393
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,920
uh if if we switched to an all networked

394
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
version of this where

395
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
where services were deployed at the edge

396
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,480
instead of in the middle of the network

397
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
that they would lose the ability to

398
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
control the value that was flowing over

399
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
the network and so they had spent 20

400
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,440
years trying to fight it

401
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
they finally lost the fight when they

402
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,639
got broken up in 1982

403
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,320
modems proliferated bbs's proliferated

404
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
and then in 1984 whoops one slide too

405
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
far in 1984

406
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
ibm launched the first pc uh the first

407
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,639
ibm pc

408
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
and the ibm pc was a remarkable uh piece

409
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
of technology not just because it used

410
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
commodity components

411
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
but because ibm didn't provide an

412
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
operating system for it

413
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
instead they sourced the operating

414
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
system from bill gates that guy who

415
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
wrote the homebrew computer club

416
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,959
letter and the reason ibm did that is

417
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
they had spent 12 years

418
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
in antitrust hell being threatened with

419
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
a breakup

420
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
by the doj and during those 12 years

421
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
ibm's lawyers spent more money every

422
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,639
single year

423
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
than the entire doj spent on all of its

424
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
antitrust actions

425
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,920
they called it antitrusts vietnam this

426
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
quagmire that they had been sunk in that

427
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
they were finally sprung from

428
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
after the breakup of at t basically

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
reagan's doj said

430
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,760
we're going to do one but not both of

431
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
america's two technology giant

432
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
monopolists

433
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
and it'll be a t not ibm so ibm was

434
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
given a stay of execution

435
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
but they knew that one of the things

436
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
that had made the doj exceptionally

437
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
angry with them

438
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
was using hardware to get a software

439
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,959
monopoly and so they said you know what

440
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,639
we're not even going to try

441
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,160
to get a software monopoly we're gonna

442
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
let microsoft provide the software

443
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
for our hardware and so before i knew it

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
there were these computers all over the

445
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,519
place

446
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,120
that had an operating system run on them

447
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
that didn't come from ibm it came from

448
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
literally like a couple of guys paul

449
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
allen and bill gates

450
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,320
and it wasn't just that the pcs

451
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
proliferated the pc clones proliferated

452
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,440
too

453
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
and the reason the pc clones

454
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
proliferated is that

455
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
a company called phoenix still in

456
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
business today still a powerhouse

457
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
hired this guy named tom jennings now

458
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
tom had run an alternative to usenet

459
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,399
called fidonet

460
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
he was a young queer uh anarchist

461
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,639
technologist and hardware wizard uh he

462
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,279
lives about

463
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,880
four miles from me here in los angeles a

464
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
wonderful guy and they asked tom to

465
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
reverse engineer the ibm pc rom which he

466
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
dutifully did for them

467
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,480
they got some texas instruments

468
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
programmers to reimplement it on

469
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,399
intel silicon so that no one could

470
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,680
accuse them of stealing any intel

471
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
microcode

472
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
and then they sold that to dell and

473
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,320
gateway and compaq

474
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
and all of these companies that sprung

475
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,519
up uh

476
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,639
all out of nowhere right and and before

477
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,600
you knew it they were

478
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
giant companies in fact they went on to

479
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,519
buy some of the largest companies in the

480
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,000
field

481
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,079
you know digital was bought out by

482
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,399
compaq this is a remarkable thing this

483
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,360
would be like

484
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
oh i don't know ibm being bought out by

485
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
your nephew

486
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
right it was a really spectacular upset

487
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to to live through and of course

488
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,279
microsoft well

489
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
you know they recapitulated their own

490
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
history they grew and they grew and they

491
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,959
became a monopolist just like ibm had

492
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:15,600
been

493
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
and the lesson that they took from ibm

494
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
was not if you're a monopolist the doj

495
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
will come after you but rather

496
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,399
if you're a monopolist you might get to

497
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
do it for 70 or 80 years before the doj

498
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
comes and smacks you down

499
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
and so they began to use the kinds of

500
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,360
dirty tricks against netscape that

501
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
had made ibm such a pariah among

502
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,519
antitrust enforcers in the u.s

503
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,320
and before you knew it uh they were

504
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
stuck with their own antitrust

505
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
investigation that went on for seven

506
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,920
years

507
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,759
and they escaped with their lives right

508
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
they were not uh broken up but like ibm

509
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
they learned an important lesson

510
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
from that antitrust investigation which

511
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
is to just like not attract

512
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
the attention of the ftc antitrust

513
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
enforcers if you can help it

514
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
and so when a couple of guys in silicon

515
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
valley started a company called google

516
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
rather than giving them the netscape

517
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
treatment they gave them

518
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,759
the uh ibm treatment they just let them

519
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,679
proceed they let them flourish

520
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
and so for me sitting there calo youth

521
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,959
watching

522
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
uh computers spring up and change and

523
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,839
watching startups go from zero to sixty

524
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,319
and then

525
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
fall uh as a new startup enters the

526
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
market it felt like we had found

527
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,439
something

528
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
perfect that we had found a kind of

529
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
market where with very little capital

530
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,319
just

531
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
just your smarts and your ability to

532
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,720
code you could gain access to a global

533
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,679
audience

534
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,039
and that that global audience would have

535
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,039
low switching costs a market

536
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,200
where the best ideas could turn into

537
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,400
companies and where those companies

538
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
could find customers

539
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,640
and change the world but what we didn't

540
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
realize

541
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
was that the anti-monopoly law that made

542
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
all this possible had been gut shot in

543
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
the 1980s

544
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,440
and it was bleeding out and it had been

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
gut shot it was bleeding out

546
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
because of this guy robert bork robert

547
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
bork for the older people in the

548
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
audience you'll remember him

549
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,679
mostly i think as the guy who tried to

550
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,200
become a supreme court justice but the

551
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
senate wouldn't confirm him because of

552
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,760
the crimes he committed when he was

553
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
nixon solicitor general

554
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,039
but despite the fact that robert bork

555
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,559
was denied a supreme court seat he

556
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,320
became incredibly influential

557
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,919
and arguably more powerful than he would

558
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,440
have been on the supreme court

559
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
he became a kind of court sorcerer to

560
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,039
the reagan cabinet

561
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
and he promulgated a new theory of

562
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
monopoly

563
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,120
whereas antitrust enforcers before this

564
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
had broken up monopolies because they

565
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
thought monopolies were bad per se

566
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,039
that concentrating power into a few

567
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
hands produced bad

568
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
outcomes that should be guarded against

569
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,480
borg said that we should only break up

570
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
monopolies we should only take action

571
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,120
against them

572
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
we should only prevent them from forming

573
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,559
when we could show that they would do

574
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,640
some harm to consumer welfare

575
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,320
and bork defined consumer welfare

576
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
primarily as prices rising as a direct

577
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
result of monopoly

578
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
and to prove that prices rised as a

579
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
direct result of monopoly or would rise

580
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
as a direct result of monopoly you had

581
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
to use these obstruct economic models

582
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
that bork and a few of his peers at the

583
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
university of chicago had invented

584
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
and that nobody else in the world really

585
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
understood and this

586
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
moved the question of monopoly out of

587
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
the political realm where everyone got

588
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
an opinion

589
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,799
into this highly technical realm this

590
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,559
mathematical realm the specialized

591
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,840
mathematical realm

592
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
where whenever anyone wanted to know

593
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
whether a company should be broken up

594
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
because prices had gone up after

595
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
something monopolistic would have to go

596
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
and consult with the sorcerers and they

597
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,440
would

598
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
slaughter an ox right they'd build a

599
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,919
model and they would read its guts

600
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,480
and they would pronounce that in those

601
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
guts they had determined

602
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
that the price rise could not be

603
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
attributed to monopoly and therefore the

604
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,240
monopoly should be allowed to continue

605
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
now these theories were incredibly

606
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,440
popular

607
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,320
with rich people because it let them get

608
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
a lot richer by forming monopolies

609
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
and those rich people funded the

610
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,960
promulgation of these theories

611
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
um they created the man seminars which

612
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
were these junkets in florida every

613
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
summer for federal judges

614
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
40 of the federal bench went to these

615
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
seminars to be re-educated about

616
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
when they should forebear and enforcing

617
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
antitrust laws

618
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
they funded law schools economics

619
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
departments think tanks and they

620
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
promulgated these ideas all around the

621
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,880
world uh in

622
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
in the uk under thatcher germany under

623
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
helmet coal canada under brian mulroney

624
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,799
through latin america through the

625
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,200
operation condor countries uh where

626
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,320
uh military juntas had taken hold and

627
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
this became the the doctrine all around

628
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,840
the world

629
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,799
and it meant that all of the things that

630
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,159
we used to prohibit

631
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,640
were now presumptively permitted so

632
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
companies were no longer banned from

633
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
merging with major competitors they were

634
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
no longer banned from snapping up

635
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
a nascent competitor before it could

636
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,480
grow to become a threat

637
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
and they were no longer banned from

638
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,919
creating vertical monopolies

639
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
now the theory of why tech became so

640
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,559
monopolized leans very hard on

641
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
exotic theories like network effects

642
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
where you know one fax machine is

643
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
useless two fax machines are useful

644
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,640
three fax

645
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,720
machines twice as useful as that and so

646
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,799
on scaling and order and squared

647
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
but a close look at how the companies

648
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,159
grew

649
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,880
reveals another explanation for why they

650
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,679
grew

651
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,360
they grew because we stopped enforcing

652
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
antitrust law

653
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
instead they grew through moneyball

654
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
through buying all their potential

655
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,960
competitors or merging with them

656
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
so a a good illustrative example is

657
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,600
google in the google graveyard

658
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,919
google is a 1.5 product company a

659
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,280
company that made one and a half

660
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
successful in-house products they made

661
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
a search engine that's very very good

662
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
and they made a pretty good hotmail

663
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
clone

664
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
and everything else that they've made

665
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
in-house failed and everything that

666
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
they've done that's successful came from

667
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,480
a company they acquired

668
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
if google had been playing under the

669
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
rules that we had before robert bork and

670
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,200
ronald reagan

671
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
they wouldn't have been allowed to buy

672
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
their ad tech companies

673
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,840
or youtube or android they would have

674
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
been a very different firm indeed

675
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,120
now network effects are real

676
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
the bell system did have a network

677
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
effect

678
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
but with tech network effects are

679
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,240
different uh

680
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,720
because of something called competitive

681
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
compatibility

682
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,799
which is a subset of interoperability

683
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,400
competitive compatibility

684
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
is the right not just to interoperate

685
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
with the consent of someone who's made a

686
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
product or service

687
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
but against their wishes so bell uh was

688
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
a great uh

689
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
enemy of competitive compatibility they

690
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
famously asserted the right to decide

691
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,320
what you could connect to the bell

692
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,640
network which phones could be plugged

693
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
into a phone jack and even which things

694
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
could be attached to a phone

695
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
uh those powers started to slip away

696
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
when they lost some celebrated lawsuits

697
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,640
like the

698
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
husha phone lawsuit hushaphone was a a

699
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
suit over a little device a cup a

700
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,120
plastic cup that fit over the mouthpiece

701
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,080
of your phone

702
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,520
so that your voice would be muffled

703
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,880
while you spoke into it and people

704
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
couldn't read your lips while you spoke

705
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
into your phone

706
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,640
and bell argued that the phone by uh

707
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
was would endanger public safety that by

708
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
mechanically coupling a third party

709
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,679
device to a terminal in their network

710
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
that the entire network which also

711
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
provided things like police services

712
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,360
fire services public safety and security

713
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
that that entire network would be in

714
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
danger by your plastic cup

715
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,919
over the mouthpiece of your phone um in

716
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,559
in the in the bell system they they

717
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,799
eventually lost those rights

718
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,360
and when they did it meant that there

719
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,320
was a huge

720
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
uh blossoming of new technologies that

721
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
could be connected to the network and

722
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
new ways that people could use them

723
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
not just modems but also answering

724
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
machines and

725
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
pbx's switchboards and so on that really

726
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,919
altered the way that

727
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,919
americans talk to one another and the

728
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,120
way that american uh

729
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,360
enterprise and the way that american uh

730
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,480
technologists

731
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
were able to do things in the world

732
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,279
now um competitive compatibility has a

733
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,600
very honorable history within the tech

734
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
world itself so think about the iwork

735
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,720
suite

736
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,240
uh before uh 1905 or 2005 rather when

737
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,039
the iwork

738
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,480
suite launched um oh someone says they

739
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
still see the newsweek and

740
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
time cover slide can someone confirm

741
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,360
whether you're seeing the new slide the

742
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,799
iwork suite slide

743
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,520
yeah we see it oh very good thank you um

744
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
so before 2005

745
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
uh people who wanted to use the mac had

746
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,799
a problem

747
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,640
and so apple had a problem and that

748
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
problem was that there was no reliable

749
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
way to read and write microsoft office

750
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,960
files

751
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
there was a version of word for the mac

752
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
at this point in excel for the mac

753
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,000
but it was to to use a really like a

754
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
generous term it was cursed

755
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
if you were the sole mac user in a

756
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
windows environment and someone sent you

757
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
a word file

758
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
and you had the misfortune to open and

759
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,559
save that word file not only could none

760
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,320
of your windows compatriots ever read

761
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
that file in all likelihood there was a

762
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,279
pretty good chance you wouldn't be able

763
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
to read that file again either

764
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,640
it was really low quality software uh

765
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
possibly the worst software microsoft

766
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,679
ever wrote i was a

767
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
network administrator and cio back then

768
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,279
i had to support a lot of heterogeneous

769
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,000
environments

770
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and it was the bane of my existence and

771
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
steve jobs sought

772
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,039
solved this problem and he solved the

773
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,600
problem not by going on bended knee to

774
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
to gates and saying will you make me a

775
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,960
better version of mac

776
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
office instead he asked some of his

777
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,320
engineers to do what tom jennings had

778
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
done with the pc rom

779
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,120
to reverse engineer uh the office suite

780
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
and make compatible products the iwork

781
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
suite so that anyone could read and

782
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
write microsoft files without using

783
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
microsoft's software it wasn't just uh

784
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,919
steve jobs and apple lexmark made them

785
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,600
the most successful laser printers at

786
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
one point they were a division of ibm

787
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
and like many printer companies they

788
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
decided to gouge their customers on

789
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
consumables

790
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
so they charged a fantastic premium on

791
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
the cartridges uh which were after all

792
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,919
just filled with powdered carbon

793
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,200
and the prices that they charged for

794
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
that powder carbon it might have well

795
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
have been diamonds

796
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
and so along came a little country a

797
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
company called uh

798
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
static controls based in taiwan they

799
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
reverse engineered the chip

800
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,080
that lexmark used to detect whether you

801
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
had refilled your cartridge

802
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
it was a little uh little eeprom i

803
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,039
believe with 12 bytes of main memory

804
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
and it ran a program that if you queried

805
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
it said i am full

806
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,679
until the until it ran out of ink and

807
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
then if you queried it it said i am

808
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,679
empty

809
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,440
even if you refilled it reverse

810
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
engineering a 12 by program wasn't all

811
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,520
that

812
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
difficult and static controls won a

813
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,159
lawsuit that lexmark brought against

814
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,440
them for building this

815
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,640
uh device and uh now static controls

816
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,840
owns lexmark

817
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,279
and so that was the kind of thing that

818
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,760
you see enabled with uh with competitive

819
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
compatibility and it wasn't

820
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,880
just lexmark and it wasn't just the mac

821
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
it was also network services when

822
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
zuckerberg launched facebook

823
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,039
and made it available to the wider

824
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,159
public expanded it beyond academic users

825
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
he had a really serious problem which is

826
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,760
that everyone in the world who wanted to

827
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,799
use social media

828
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
already had an account on a rival

829
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
service called myspace that was owned by

830
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,080
the world's most rapacious vicious

831
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
billionaire

832
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
rupert murdoch he wasn't going to let

833
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
his users go without a fight

834
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,039
and facebook was arguably a lot better

835
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,640
than myspace ironically one of the

836
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,919
things that was better about facebook in

837
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,039
those days was that they were more

838
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,559
respecting of your privacy

839
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,039
they didn't allow google to crawl it uh

840
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,840
they

841
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,960
they had a lot of tools that allowed you

842
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
to create private groups and so on

843
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
um but they had a really serious

844
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,640
downside for people who are already

845
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,159
using myspace which is that none of your

846
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
friends were using facebook yet

847
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
and so everyone was mutually holding

848
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,120
each other hostage and

849
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,240
what that meant was that anyone who left

850
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
myspace for facebook would have a better

851
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
service and no one to use it with

852
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
and so people were stuck and so

853
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
zuckerberg zuckerberg's company

854
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
made a bot and you gave that bot your

855
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
login credentials it would visit myspace

856
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,279
on your behalf scrape your waiting email

857
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,880
put it in your facebook inbox let you

858
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,399
reply to it and push it back out to

859
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,600
myspace

860
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,640
and in that one stroke the network

861
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
effect advantage

862
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,919
the walled garden that facebook had

863
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
built was turned on its head

864
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
it became a feed lot it became a neatly

865
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,279
organized array of potential customers

866
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,960
for superior service that uh outdid it

867
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,559
now when you look at the history of any

868
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
of today's big tech giants

869
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you see this competitive compatibility

870
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,320
this uh permissionless innovation

871
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,200
in its history but today all of that

872
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,399
stuff is off limits

873
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,559
thanks to the lobbying of the big tech

874
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,440
companies

875
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
so between software patents uh software

876
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,880
copyrights

877
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,080
anti-circumvention rules that prohibit

878
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
bypassing

879
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,200
a means of access control uh the um

880
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,039
terms of service enforceable terms of

881
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,320
service

882
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,520
and the novel uh suijanaris rights that

883
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,000
are being

884
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
fought over in the courts like oracle's

885
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,880
bid to make apis copyrightable

886
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
um you see the foreclosure of

887
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,640
competitive compatibility you see this

888
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
new regime

889
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,679
where if you choose your technology and

890
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,120
your law carefully

891
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,799
you can design a product that can't be

892
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
used in ways that you disfavor

893
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,559
you can design a product where using it

894
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
in ways that you disfavor amount to

895
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
felony contempt of business model

896
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
after all section 121 of the dmca the

897
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,159
law that prohibits circumventing a

898
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,360
copyright control

899
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
provides for a five-year prison sentence

900
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
and a five hundred thousand dollar fine

901
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:14,720
for

902
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,480
first offense so all of this stuff gets

903
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,919
lumped under something called

904
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,799
ip or intellectual property and the free

905
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,240
culture free software movement

906
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,159
really doesn't like the term ip they say

907
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,600
it's disingenuous

908
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
that um none of this stuff is really

909
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
property that trademark is nothing like

910
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,799
copyright and copyright is nothing like

911
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,360
patent

912
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,720
and why are we grouping all of these

913
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,960
together anyway but i think that there

914
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,840
there is

915
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,279
and they argue that we should use a

916
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,960
different term for

917
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,520
ip they say that we should call them up

918
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,039
they say that we should call it authors

919
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,399
monopolies

920
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,840
they say that that's the term that we

921
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
used to use before copyright came along

922
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,840
or before ip came along

923
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
we called these monopolies because they

924
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,559
were government granted monopolies and

925
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,919
we should acknowledge what their

926
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,960
what their true role is but as this

927
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,320
litany of ways that we've seen

928
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,080
competitive compatibility foreclosed

929
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,279
upon shows us

930
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,840
ip does have a very precise technical

931
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,720
meaning

932
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,240
in the tech industry ip is any rule

933
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,919
or law that allows a commercial firm

934
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,440
to control the conduct of its

935
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
competitors its critics

936
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,120
and its customers so those those

937
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
uh tools are incredibly powerful

938
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,159
and when you fuse them with an author's

939
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,320
monopoly when you when you take

940
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,880
the market monopoly that we see firms

941
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
getting because of robert bork's

942
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,919
forbearance and the ability to buy your

943
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,600
competitors or merge with them

944
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
or create vertical monopolies and you

945
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,679
infuse authors monopolies into them when

946
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,320
you add

947
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,960
ip patents or copyrights or terms of

948
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
service

949
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,279
you get something that is far more

950
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,080
durable than an author's monopoly

951
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
or a market monopoly you get a market

952
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,799
monopoly that the government will defend

953
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
in the name of defending authors

954
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,919
monopolies

955
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,440
so in other words if you are universal

956
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
music

957
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,760
and you have a monopoly on

958
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,080
all you know sort of two-thirds of the

959
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
popular music catalog

960
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
that might be a source of concern for

961
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,960
your general counsel you might worry

962
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,159
that someday you'll attract

963
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
attract anti-trust scrutiny and be

964
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,919
forced to divest yourself of some of the

965
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,679
divisions that you've acquired

966
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,880
but if somebody wants to escape

967
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
your contracting terms and make their

968
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,240
own music

969
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
their own hip-hop that remixes the stuff

970
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,000
that's in your catalog

971
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
and they choose not to take a license

972
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
because doing so means signing your

973
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,399
contract

974
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
and your contract is extraordinarily

975
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,440
abusive because

976
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,000
you have a monopoly then the fact that

977
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,519
they sample your music without your

978
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
permission

979
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
allows you to ask the government to

980
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,399
punish them for doing it

981
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
for for making your shareholders sad um

982
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,919
this is a

983
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,320
a novel thing on the earth where you

984
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
have authors monopolies and market

985
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,080
monopolies fused together

986
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,519
in ways that allow large firms to suborn

987
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,720
the state

988
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
to serve their parochial commercial

989
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,320
interests

990
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
and of interest to this group might be

991
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,840
the way that um

992
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
the these authors monopolies fused with

993
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,159
market monopolies allow firms to control

994
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,440
their competitors

995
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
because under section 1201 of the

996
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
digital millennium copyright act

997
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,080
under the computer fraud and abuse act

998
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,480
of 1986 a cyber security bill

999
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
and under other things that we describe

1000
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,000
as ip we have seen

1001
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
independent security researchers

1002
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,760
threatened and even shut down and in one

1003
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
case dragged off a stage at a security

1004
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,000
conference

1005
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
by the fbi and arrested for bypassing

1006
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,799
copyright controls

1007
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,080
for ignoring terms of service and doing

1008
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
the other normal things that security

1009
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
researchers do

1010
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
in order to discover defects in products

1011
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,159
that people relied on

1012
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,679
that the firms didn't want their

1013
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,279
customers to know about because who

1014
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,799
wants their customers to know

1015
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,480
about the stupid mistakes that they have

1016
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
made

1017
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,320
so i started saying that the early

1018
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,080
internet boosters were not blind to the

1019
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
peril of technology

1020
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,880
but um maybe they were just a little

1021
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
uh after all once all that money started

1022
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,799
sloshing around

1023
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,480
then if you could convince yourself that

1024
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
the tech was an unforced

1025
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,320
an unchecked force for good you might be

1026
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
able to get some of that money even if

1027
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,080
you're

1028
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,880
compromising your principles the myth of

1029
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
two guys in a garage who could topple

1030
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,159
billion dollar giants and become

1031
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,600
billionaires themselves

1032
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
fired a lot of techies imaginations but

1033
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,679
it also sidelined a lot of their

1034
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,360
consciences

1035
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
now for better for worse those days are

1036
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,480
behind us

1037
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,720
thanks to monopolization the lines of

1038
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
business that the largest tech firms are

1039
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,880
in

1040
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
and even the lines that are adjacent to

1041
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
them are described by investors as the

1042
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,519
kill zone

1043
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
and no one will invest in them despite

1044
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,039
the fact that these large firms

1045
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,600
are experiencing double-digit growth uh

1046
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,559
year on year

1047
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
and reaping billions of dollars in

1048
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,320
profits profits that endure

1049
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,679
even through the calamitous pandemic

1050
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,919
so what that means is that the ambitions

1051
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,440
of technologists who go to silicon

1052
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
valley and other tech centers are shrunk

1053
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,919
from starting a company in a garage that

1054
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,760
changes the world makes a dent in the

1055
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,919
universe as steve jobs used to say

1056
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,880
to getting a job with a really good 401k

1057
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,640
where there's kombucha on tap and you

1058
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,359
get free massages on wednesdays

1059
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,280
and liberated from the fear of losing

1060
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
their customers to competitors

1061
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
tech has pivoted now it's in the

1062
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,159
business

1063
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,800
of locking in manipulating and abusing

1064
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
its users

1065
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,399
now the workers who write that code the

1066
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,159
workers who spend every hour that god

1067
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,918
sends writing code to take away your

1068
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,960
autonomy

1069
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,639
they're technologists they're

1070
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,079
technologists who discovered their

1071
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,599
passion for the field

1072
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,719
when they felt the thrill of

1073
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,480
self-determination that arises when you

1074
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,679
make code

1075
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,599
share it in a network and discover a

1076
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,960
community

1077
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,239
i think that this is an important

1078
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,320
fracture line

1079
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,719
for the last two years we have seen a

1080
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,520
rising tide of tech worker walkouts

1081
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,359
tech worker solidarity movements with

1082
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,119
other workers within tech firms like

1083
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,159
contractors

1084
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,719
or warehouse workers at amazon and of

1085
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,960
refusals to build certain kinds of

1086
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,000
technology

1087
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,760
on the grounds that it is too ripe for

1088
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,560
misuse no tech for ice antifacial

1089
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,920
recognition movements

1090
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,520
uh the walk out over um google building

1091
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,240
a

1092
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,560
censored chinese search engine or over

1093
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,480
providing artificial intelligence

1094
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,640
machine learning classifies classifiers

1095
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,720
to the u.s drone program

1096
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,440
and um it's it's interesting because

1097
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,119
it's tempting to compare these people to

1098
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,480
robert oppenheimer

1099
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,760
who was after all a genius and also a

1100
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,880
great force for

1101
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
moral uh discourse within technology

1102
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
oppenheimer was a brilliant physicist

1103
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
and a brilliant manager and there were a

1104
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,720
lot of brilliant physicists in his day

1105
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,440
and there were a lot of brilliant

1106
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
managers in his day but there weren't a

1107
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
lot of brilliant physicists

1108
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,160
who were also brilliant managers and so

1109
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,359
that's why he ended up running the

1110
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,720
manhattan project to make the first

1111
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,079
nuclear bomb

1112
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,560
and it was part way it was uh partway

1113
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,359
through the uh

1114
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,760
uh first field deployment of the nuclear

1115
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
bomb that rob and

1116
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,480
robert oppenheimer started to have

1117
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
regrets after the first

1118
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,359
trial of the nuclear bomb in los alamos

1119
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,680
he very famously said um

1120
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,599
uh turned away from it and quoted the

1121
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,280
bhagavad gita and he said i am become

1122
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
death the destroyer of worlds

1123
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,560
and he spent the rest of his career

1124
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,880
publicly repudiating

1125
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,240
the use of atoms and atomic bombs

1126
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
for war he was interested in things like

1127
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
the project orion sending

1128
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,320
sending spaceships into into uh deep

1129
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,520
space with nukes

1130
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,839
but not dropping them on cities anymore

1131
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,720
and it was so

1132
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
intense that when he was summoned to the

1133
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
president's office to congrat for

1134
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,160
so that he could be congratulating his

1135
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,400
role in making the bomb he instead told

1136
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,760
the president that he regretted it and

1137
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
the president threw him out

1138
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
and told his assistant never to let

1139
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
quote that in here

1140
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,440
again so um

1141
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,640
i have an interest in this uh because of

1142
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,200
something i did uh i wrote a novel that

1143
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
came out in 2008 called little brother

1144
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,640
and it's a book about kids

1145
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
who sees the means of computation and

1146
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,760
fight back

1147
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
against technological oppression it's

1148
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
kind of a how-to book it's it's a

1149
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,079
it's a crypto primer disguised as a

1150
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,599
young adult novel

1151
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,040
and lots of people have read that book

1152
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,720
it's a new york times bestseller it's

1153
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
been translated into dozens of languages

1154
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,359
adapted in many ways and i've lost track

1155
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,960
of the number of security professionals

1156
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
cryptographers cyber lawyers human

1157
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,440
rights activists

1158
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,040
who've come up to me and said you know i

1159
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,320
read that book and it changed the way i

1160
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
thought about technology

1161
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,760
and that's why i do what i do today it's

1162
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,520
a source of enormous pride

1163
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,280
it was even before i went and saw

1164
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
citizen iv the edward snowden

1165
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,000
documentary

1166
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,760
and realized that snowden had taken a

1167
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
copy of its sequel homeland

1168
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,599
with him when he went into hiding in

1169
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,640
hong kong and then into exile in russia

1170
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,240
and um although i had reached a kind of

1171
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,000
force of technologists who wanted to

1172
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
make tech a force for good

1173
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
i also realized that there was another

1174
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,359
cohort of technologists who were

1175
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,680
late stage oppenheimers right they were

1176
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,119
they were coming at it too late they

1177
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,720
were regretting their work after they

1178
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,520
built it

1179
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,640
and not before and so last summer

1180
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,400
our last uh autumn rather i published

1181
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
this book attack surface

1182
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
which is a book about a young woman who

1183
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
confronts

1184
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,240
the moral valence of her work as a

1185
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
surveillance contractor

1186
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,000
regrets it and dedicates herself to

1187
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,720
doing uh to remediating the harm

1188
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
and it's a book about having a reckoning

1189
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,079
uh it's an adult novel

1190
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,359
not not because uh it's uh got sex and

1191
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,560
it doesn't have any sex in it the young

1192
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,839
adult novels have sex in it because

1193
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,920
teenagers think about sex all the time

1194
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
the older you get the less it's on your

1195
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,200
mind and the less significant it is to

1196
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,760
you

1197
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,200
it's an adult novel because it's about

1198
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,280
moral reckonings and most teenagers

1199
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
don't need moral reckonings and even the

1200
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,480
ones that do are probably unlikely to

1201
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
have them until they've got a few miles

1202
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,880
under them so i find this to be an

1203
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,800
urgent project this project of

1204
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,079
addressing people

1205
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,119
who are caught in this contradiction

1206
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,920
because uh those authors monopolies are

1207
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,119
now available for

1208
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,520
every kind of technology every kind of

1209
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
device not just general purpose

1210
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,599
computers

1211
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,440
but anything with an embedded system in

1212
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
it and

1213
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
and what that means is that all of the

1214
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
technologies in your

1215
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,640
life can now be designed to be adverse

1216
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,119
to you to work against your interests

1217
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,040
and that the state will intervene to

1218
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,520
defend the manufacturer against you

1219
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
if you try to reconfigure them so that

1220
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
they act for you

1221
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,480
and not for some distant firms

1222
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
shareholders

1223
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,839
and worse than that these computers that

1224
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,240
live

1225
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
in our embedded systems they're not just

1226
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
a technology that uh

1227
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,599
binds us they're a technology that

1228
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,240
watches us and if we violate the rules

1229
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,839
that the manufacturers set down

1230
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,200
they are liable to contact the

1231
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
manufacturer and snitch on us

1232
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
and so this is a new kind of orwellian

1233
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
vision of technology

1234
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,839
one that frankly scares the pants off of

1235
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,599
me

1236
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,359
so what are we going to do about all

1237
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,720
this stuff how are we going to

1238
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,760
resolve this what's the theory of change

1239
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,640
the copyright scholar james boyle who's

1240
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,240
at duke university

1241
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,280
says that uh before the coining of the

1242
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,079
term ecology in the early 1970s

1243
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,280
there were people who cared about

1244
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
ecological issues but they didn't know

1245
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,000
that they were on the same

1246
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,079
side you know if you liked owls and i

1247
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,359
like the ozone layer

1248
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,040
it wasn't immediately apparent that you

1249
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
and i were fighting the same cause

1250
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,119
but the term ecology turned a thousand

1251
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,560
issues into one movement

1252
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
with a thousand ways to get involved in

1253
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,680
it and

1254
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,839
we are living in a moment in which we

1255
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,359
could conceivably

1256
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,319
uh rebalance our relationship with large

1257
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,280
firms

1258
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,880
not in spite of the fact that there are

1259
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,640
monopolies everywhere but because

1260
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,520
there are monopolies everywhere people

1261
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,440
come to harm because of monopolies

1262
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,680
uh not just in the tech sphere you know

1263
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
the us has one major glass bottle

1264
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,040
manufacturer left in it

1265
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,319
it's one of the reasons we've struggled

1266
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,400
so hard to distribute vaccines to people

1267
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,079
there's only one eyeglass manufacturer

1268
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,440
of any size left they also on the

1269
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,240
largest lens

1270
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
manufacturer which makes more than half

1271
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,440
of the lenses in the world and every

1272
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
major eye eyewear retailer

1273
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
you've ever heard of from lens crafters

1274
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
to sears optical to sunglass hut

1275
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,319
and also the largest eyewear insurer and

1276
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,000
they've raised the price of glasses a

1277
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,839
thousand percent over ten years

1278
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,040
although uh our friends at the

1279
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,640
university of chicago will assure you

1280
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
that the glasses went up in price

1281
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,839
for reasons completely unrelated to

1282
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,520
monopoly and we're uh

1283
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,599
and and if we disagree they will make a

1284
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,040
model that proves it

1285
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
there are people who are angry because

1286
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,040
professional wrestling has dwindled to a

1287
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,079
single league

1288
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
and they've reclassified all of their

1289
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,079
workers as contractors taken away their

1290
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:14,880
health care

1291
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
and now those wrestlers that those kids

1292
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,560
grew up loving are begging for pennies

1293
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,640
on gofundme so they can die with dignity

1294
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,400
of their work-related injuries that that

1295
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,760
are uninsured

1296
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
and then there's the big four accounting

1297
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,440
firms the insurance firms the big three

1298
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,520
studios the one movie theater

1299
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
the one beer the one spirits company the

1300
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
two beer companies

1301
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,079
and so on and so on up and down the dial

1302
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:36,480
uh

1303
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,160
and when these companies achieve

1304
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
monopolies they distort our policy and

1305
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,319
they hurt us with impunity

1306
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,640
if we can reach out to those people we

1307
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,319
can make a difference right we can we

1308
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,920
can gather all those people together

1309
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,280
into a political force the way the

1310
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,720
ecology movement did

1311
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,319
and we can say look it's i'm not all

1312
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,680
that exercised about professional

1313
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,240
wrestling

1314
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,800
but i am exercised about monopolies and

1315
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
if you will fight monopolies in tech

1316
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,160
i'll fight them in wrestling alongside

1317
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,760
of you

1318
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,720
above all we need to get past the story

1319
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,160
the reason that technology became

1320
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,119
monopolized

1321
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,839
is that it's run by evil super geniuses

1322
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,200
ultimately the lesson

1323
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
of monopolization across all these

1324
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
sectors is that we got monopolies

1325
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,480
because it was monopolizing time and

1326
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,880
that

1327
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
those technology super geniuses they're

1328
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,560
just three sociopaths and a trench coat

1329
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:30,240
and that's my talk thank you very much

1330
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,079
thank you that was a lot of material um

1331
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,960
and if people have questions please post

1332
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,520
them in the q

1333
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
a

1334
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,520
i have many comments on the chats but

1335
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
i'm not seeing any questions popping up

1336
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
yet

1337
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,040
ah yeah i see them too we'll give people

1338
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,160
a few moments here

1339
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,599
obviously when you say things that are

1340
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,680
as uncontroversial and obvious is that

1341
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,760
it's uh it's common for there to be no

1342
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,240
uh no questions everyone just nods and

1343
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,520
says yeah no that's why i thought all

1344
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,920
along

1345
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,680
uh there's one yeah there's two ago

1346
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,800
right so um what's the best to counter

1347
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,640
tech monopoly so i think that

1348
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,400
there we're seeing some some really

1349
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,920
important this is ralph's question ralph

1350
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,440
poor thank you for your question ralph

1351
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,680
i think we're seeing some really good uh

1352
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,359
uh initiatives towards fighting tech

1353
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,400
monopolies

1354
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,240
and there are both technical and

1355
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,079
non-technical remedies

1356
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,839
and it's important not to take away from

1357
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
my talk that um

1358
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,720
although tech became monopolized due to

1359
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,480
the same forces that allowed monopolies

1360
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,440
to flourish elsewhere

1361
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,280
namely forbearance on anti-monopoly

1362
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,040
enforcement that

1363
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,760
tech is not exactly the same as all

1364
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,160
these

1365
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,920
other industries you know think about

1366
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,599
the railroad the railroad

1367
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,000
creates monopolies as well but the

1368
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,280
railroad does not have this

1369
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
compatibility dimension to it that

1370
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,040
digital technology does

1371
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,200
in australia in the 19th century

1372
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,359
would-be rail barons all laid their rail

1373
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,720
at different gauges

1374
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,880
so that they could create monopolies and

1375
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
150 years later this is a very serious

1376
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,319
problem

1377
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,800
they call it the middle gauge model and

1378
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
for 150 years they've tried to resolve

1379
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,640
it with interoperability they've tried

1380
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
two to 300 different kinds of rail car

1381
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
that can drop a set of wheels and

1382
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,560
retract a set of wheels and

1383
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,440
hop onto a new set of tracks after 150

1384
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,040
years and a couple hundred designs

1385
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
they're just tearing up the rail and

1386
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,800
laying new rail because that turns out

1387
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,400
to be the most effective and efficient

1388
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,119
way to do it

1389
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,200
that's not the case with computers right

1390
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,640
with computers if you have some code

1391
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,400
that's locked in some silo

1392
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,640
you stick it in a vm or you write a

1393
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,319
compatibility layer or you reverse

1394
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
engineer the file format

1395
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,920
you don't you don't just throw away the

1396
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,680
computer you don't throw away the idea

1397
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,880
of computing you don't

1398
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
reconstruct your data from scratch right

1399
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,720
this is the cool and amazing and

1400
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,760
terrifying thing about

1401
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,680
information security is that this

1402
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,359
compatibility is always there

1403
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,280
you know if we can make a program that

1404
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,960
are a computing substrate that was

1405
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,040
mostly touring complete but not totally

1406
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,920
touring complete

1407
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,440
we wouldn't have malware that could run

1408
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,960
in printers because we could make a

1409
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,599
printer

1410
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,000
that only ran printing commands and not

1411
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,359
you know general purpose computing

1412
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,960
commands that allowed it to

1413
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,560
uh open a reverse shell through your

1414
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,040
firewall and then uh probe all the

1415
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,680
all the machines on your land for zero

1416
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,480
days and

1417
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,800
uh and then infiltrate them and then uh

1418
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,839
and then allow

1419
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,160
the uh the bot master to exfiltrate all

1420
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,040
the data

1421
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,079
you know so that compatibility is

1422
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,560
is the source of enormously powerful

1423
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
antitrust remedies

1424
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,640
some that will work faster than the

1425
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,079
traditional anti-trust remedies of

1426
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,359
blocking mergers and unwinding mergers

1427
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,560
for example uh if we decide that a

1428
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,119
company is abusing its monopoly

1429
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,319
on app stores we might demand that they

1430
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,839
allow third parties to operate app

1431
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,599
stores uh a bill to that effect just

1432
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,319
failed in the

1433
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,280
in the north dakota legislature uh no

1434
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,480
sorry the wyoming

1435
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,960
legislature wyoming i believe one either

1436
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,640
north dakota wyoming i beg your pardon

1437
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,079
i should have known that off the tip but

1438
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,319
it today it failed in the legislature

1439
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,160
uh and the european union the digital

1440
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,920
services act and the digital markets act

1441
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
make just that mandate along with many

1442
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,400
other mandates that come along with it

1443
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,200
you could imagine that a a state might

1444
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,079
enact a

1445
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,480
legisl legislation that says that it's a

1446
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,200
matter uh

1447
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,440
it's against public policy for certain

1448
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
contracting terms to be in terms of

1449
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,160
service

1450
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,319
like a contracting term that forbade

1451
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,680
reverse engineering for

1452
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
security research or for accessibility

1453
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,359
or for other purposes

1454
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,599
and those contracting terms would simply

1455
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,480
become null

1456
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,359
as a matter of state law this is why for

1457
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,119
example in california

1458
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,000
non-compete clauses aren't uh aren't

1459
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,599
enforceable california law prohibits

1460
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,000
them

1461
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,240
so you can put them in a contract but

1462
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,319
can enforce that contract in california

1463
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,240
it's pretty good news for silicon valley

1464
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,599
because it meant that when robert

1465
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,280
shockley who started fairchild the first

1466
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,079
first silicon valley company went

1467
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,800
bananas

1468
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,319
and decided to stop trying to make

1469
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,319
microchips and instead spend all of his

1470
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,520
nobel prize money

1471
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,560
paying people of color to get sterilized

1472
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
because he became a eugenicist

1473
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,960
that his eight early employees didn't

1474
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,319
have to hang around with this odious

1475
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:08,960
troll

1476
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,800
and instead could leave and found intel

1477
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,079
with having to worry about without

1478
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,200
having to worry about

1479
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,160
non-competes so we could impose limits

1480
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,079
on contracting terms that would clean up

1481
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,480
terms of service rather a lot

1482
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,160
we could reform the digital millennium

1483
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
copyright act to permit uh

1484
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,079
reverse engineering and bypassing

1485
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,839
technical protection measures

1486
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,000
for beneficial purposes or when there's

1487
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
no nexus with a copyright infringement

1488
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,480
or we could bind companies that are

1489
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,680
caught with their hands in the cookie

1490
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,040
jar companies caught

1491
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,359
violating the law we could say that as a

1492
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,359
condition of settling those those

1493
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,599
claims they would have to forbear they

1494
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,640
would have to eschew

1495
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,680
access to that or we might say as a

1496
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,680
procurement guideline at our state or

1497
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,000
federal level that we won't procure any

1498
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,200
any devices unless the manufacturer bind

1499
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,440
signs a binding covenant not to enforce

1500
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,720
these rules that allow them to block

1501
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,760
interoperability

1502
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,400
this is actually a very old tradition in

1503
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,280
procurement

1504
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,640
it goes all the way back to the civil

1505
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,319
war when the union army

1506
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,000
said that they would only buy guns if

1507
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
they could second source parts and

1508
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,960
ammunition for those guns

1509
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,559
because they didn't want to be dependent

1510
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,480
on a single manufacturer for it

1511
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
so imagine if your school district said

1512
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
yeah we're going to buy ipads

1513
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,599
but we're going to demand the right to

1514
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,599
side load on them because if apple has a

1515
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
dispute with the company that makes the

1516
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,480
edtech that we use for 50 000 students

1517
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,240
um we don't want to just be left out

1518
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,760
hanging out there and you know this is a

1519
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,720
real possibility

1520
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,960
apple removed fortnite like a couple of

1521
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,000
months ago so

1522
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,079
there's there's plenty of of reason to

1523
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,920
believe that this might happen again

1524
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,000
and why should we as taxpayers who

1525
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,520
support a school district

1526
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,599
tolerate them buying a device that could

1527
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,040
be effectively bricked by the

1528
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,720
manufacturer

1529
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,240
they might also say that before they

1530
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,839
procure google classroom

1531
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,720
they're going to secure a uh binding

1532
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,760
promise from google

1533
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,440
that they won't block inter operators

1534
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,040
who make new tools that allow you to

1535
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,440
more

1536
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,599
better integrate google classroom with

1537
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,960
rivals products

1538
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,359
or do security audits or add extra

1539
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,760
privacy layers or what have you

1540
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,440
so all of those things are available to

1541
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,359
us and a lot of them work a lot

1542
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,400
faster than mere antitrust right

1543
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,720
lawsuits take a long time recall

1544
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,760
ibm and antitrusts vietnam so it's

1545
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,359
conceivable that we could uh

1546
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,960
we could get there a lot faster through

1547
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
these other remedies and then you know

1548
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,640
more generally

1549
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,160
we could unwind all the mergers that

1550
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
were undertaken under false pretenses so

1551
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,319
google promised when they uh bought

1552
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
their ad tech companies

1553
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,200
and youtube that they wouldn't mine uh

1554
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
data from across multiple google

1555
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,319
services to

1556
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,240
uh to build a single profile that could

1557
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,079
be used by their ad tech companies

1558
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,280
and then they then they broke their

1559
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,359
promise right in the european union

1560
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,800
facebook said that they would only that

1561
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,480
they would promise not to merge the back

1562
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,839
ends of whatsapp and instagram with

1563
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,040
facebook messenger

1564
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,599
and they lied and you know if you uh

1565
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,680
obtain a merger under false pretenses

1566
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,440
you should have to unwind the merger

1567
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,160
that that should be the the remedy not

1568
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,079
uh in spite of the fact that it's a very

1569
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,599
expensive and difficult remedy but

1570
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,440
because of it you know as camus said

1571
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,839
sometimes you have to execute an admiral

1572
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,200
to encourage the others

1573
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,640
right we should send a message to

1574
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,880
everyone who undertakes a merger on

1575
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
false pretenses

1576
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,400
that they're not allowed that that uh

1577
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,760
they can't keep the company that they

1578
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,240
bought

1579
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,559
and if it costs them billions of dollars

1580
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,280
or destroys the company that they bought

1581
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,520
tough nuggies you shouldn't allied right

1582
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,640
you shouldn't get to hang on to

1583
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
something you attain through fraudulent

1584
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,200
means

1585
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,599
um and then we can block new mergers

1586
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,160
there's always new mergers underway

1587
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,319
you know the the aqua hire is this weird

1588
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,839
toxic thing that's coming to silicon

1589
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,680
valley where because of the kill zone

1590
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,440
if you do a cool startup you don't get

1591
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,880
to like you know

1592
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,119
take that startup public or or make a

1593
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,400
product with it

1594
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,000
really your cool startup exists as a

1595
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,440
postgraduate project

1596
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,359
that you use to impress recruiters from

1597
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,559
big tech companies

1598
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,640
your vcs aren't really vcs they're head

1599
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,000
hunters the

1600
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
uh notional purchase of your shares

1601
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,520
isn't really a purchase or shares it's a

1602
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,119
hiring bonus for you and a finder's fee

1603
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,480
for your vc

1604
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,559
and you know we can block those mergers

1605
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,400
if we block those mergers vcs will fund

1606
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,680
different kinds of companies

1607
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,800
and if they fund different kinds of

1608
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
companies will get products that

1609
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,119
actually compete with the big tech

1610
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,000
companies

1611
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,280
so that's what i think uh let's look at

1612
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,440
some of these other questions here

1613
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,920
uh

1614
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,160
i um

1615
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,079
what is the role of gpl i like this

1616
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,079
james harney what is the role of gpl

1617
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,599
license software and potential solutions

1618
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,800
to tech monopolies

1619
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
so one of the things that's interesting

1620
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,160
about gpl

1621
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,040
is is um that it constitutes a kind of

1622
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,319
ulysses pact

1623
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,920
so those of you who remember your your

1624
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,839
greek mythology and or

1625
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,319
read the odyssey will know that ulysses

1626
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,760
was a hacker

1627
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,040
so there was like an established

1628
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,280
protocol for sailing through the the sea

1629
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,599
of the sirens who were these uh

1630
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,440
fish women who when they sang made you

1631
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,720
jump into the sea and then they would

1632
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,680
devour you

1633
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,000
and the accepted protocol for that was

1634
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,079
to fill your ears with wax

1635
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,920
so that you couldn't hear the siren song

1636
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,760
but ulysses being a hacker

1637
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,040
wanted to find a better way because he

1638
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,400
wanted to hear the song he figured it

1639
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,680
was probably pretty cool

1640
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
and so he lashed himself to the mast and

1641
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,800
uh when he was lash the mask he could

1642
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,079
hear the song but he couldn't jump in

1643
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,040
the seat

1644
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,200
not because he didn't want to and not

1645
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,119
because he wasn't weak

1646
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,520
and vulnerable but because he understood

1647
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,200
that that moment of weakness was coming

1648
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,599
up

1649
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,680
and he planned for it it's the same

1650
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,520
reason you throw away your oreos then

1651
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,720
you go on a diet

1652
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,920
not because you're immune to temptation

1653
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,280
but because you have the maturity to

1654
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
anticipate temptation and to take

1655
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,599
yourself out of temptation's way

1656
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,559
and the gpl is a ulysses pact in the

1657
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,960
sense that it is an irrevocable license

1658
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,319
so once you apply the gpl to your code

1659
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,520
you pre-commit to permitting all comers

1660
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,760
to build new things with your code and

1661
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,359
nothing can cause you to take that

1662
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,160
license back

1663
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
out not even if you want to uh you know

1664
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,200
if you're

1665
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,839
if your investors show up and they say

1666
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:02,400
look

1667
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,920
you know you're running out of money

1668
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,200
you're not gonna be able to make payroll

1669
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,160
this week

1670
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,079
we've changed our mind about this gpl

1671
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,839
thing if you don't uh

1672
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,240
if you don't um take the gpl off your

1673
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:12,880
code

1674
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,160
we're going to shut your business down

1675
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,599
and all those friends that you convinced

1676
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,440
to quit their good jobs

1677
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,280
and risk their kids college funds

1678
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,720
they're going to lose their jobs and

1679
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,240
maybe end up homeless

1680
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,400
even then you can't say all right i'm

1681
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,920
going to take the gpl off my code it's

1682
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,200
irrevocable

1683
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,000
nothing can pressurize you into doing it

1684
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,200
and so

1685
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,880
there are lots of people who found

1686
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
companies and build technologies with

1687
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,960
the best of intention

1688
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
and then either they find themselves in

1689
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,480
a moment of weakness

1690
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,319
or they find themselves absent and

1691
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,400
someone who's got different ethics or

1692
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,760
morals to them

1693
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,079
is in charge of their technology i had a

1694
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,440
call with some apple people a little

1695
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,400
while ago

1696
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,079
who were talking with me about how

1697
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,079
apple's controls are used in service

1698
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,599
primarily to their users which i think

1699
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,079
is true

1700
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,119
except in china but i said you know

1701
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,160
jeff bezos just retired what if tim cook

1702
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,760
has a heart attack

1703
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,440
and jeff bezos decides to come out of

1704
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,119
retirement after the board begs and

1705
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:07,839
pleads

1706
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,640
and he's the ceo of apple do you think

1707
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,319
that he'll use that power that apple has

1708
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,319
irrigated to itself as wisely as tim

1709
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,359
cook did

1710
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,920
and they both got this very ashen look

1711
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,359
when i said that

1712
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,640
and so uh the gpl by by forming this

1713
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,319
kind of pre-commitment

1714
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,359
is a means of safeguarding not just for

1715
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:28,960
against your own future weakness and

1716
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,680
frailty

1717
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
but against the weakness or vanality of

1718
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,960
people who come after you

1719
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
and so in that regard is very good it is

1720
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,599
insufficient

1721
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,799
as we've seen the the uh cloud

1722
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,040
is uh not up to snuff when it comes to

1723
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,200
gpl or gpl's not its stuff snuff when it

1724
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,319
comes to the cloud

1725
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,240
benjamin mako hill gave an excellent

1726
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,079
2018 presentation

1727
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,400
at libre planet one of the keynotes

1728
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,640
where he he said that um

1729
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,760
open source is what the rest of us got

1730
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
all of us can see the code that

1731
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,920
backstops google's cloud or amazon's

1732
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,680
cloud it's all sitting there on github

1733
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,319
we can alter that software we can commit

1734
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,079
improvements to that software and and

1735
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,400
push them into the github instance

1736
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,079
what we can't do is alter how the cloud

1737
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,280
works uh that software freedom

1738
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,280
as distinct from the open source that

1739
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,559
software freedom

1740
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,559
is only owned by the monopolists who run

1741
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,839
cloud companies

1742
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,400
and so those people who said that open

1743
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,440
source

1744
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,240
and its stress of instrumental benefits

1745
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,839
would be a good proxy

1746
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,680
for free software and its stress on

1747
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,359
ethical benefits

1748
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,599
were i think proven wrong that it's

1749
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,200
entirely possible

1750
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,839
to have the mechanical underlying

1751
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,000
mechanisms of open source intact

1752
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
without the software freedom that

1753
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,079
underpin them and that they were created

1754
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,520
in the name of

1755
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,559
um i'm going to answer

1756
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,760
one more question because we've got two

1757
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,119
and a half minutes left and i have

1758
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,200
another call to get on

1759
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,680
privacy is an illusion this is from

1760
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,359
george jarvis can true privacy be

1761
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,079
realized

1762
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,760
given our government is using technology

1763
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,680
monopolies as surrogates to circumvent

1764
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,839
them

1765
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,680
and if somebody could get privacy

1766
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,480
wouldn't the level be correlated to

1767
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,760
being a terrorist wouldn't it make you

1768
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,200
look like a terrorist if you took steps

1769
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,480
to defend your privacy

1770
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,799
so i think privacy you know first of all

1771
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,040
it needs to be understood as not secrecy

1772
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,119
uh privacy is not that nobody else knows

1773
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,799
your business privacy is that

1774
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,319
you get to decide who knows your

1775
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,000
business uh and

1776
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,640
so it's true that if you wanted to keep

1777
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,760
things secret

1778
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,240
it's really hard but if you want to

1779
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,000
decide who you share stuff with it's

1780
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,520
actually pretty straightforward we have

1781
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,599
more privacy primitives

1782
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,000
at our disposal than anyone in the

1783
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,760
history of the world right i mean

1784
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,480
you know kings used to shave messengers

1785
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,640
heads and tattoo messages on their scalp

1786
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,240
and wait for their hair to grow out

1787
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,319
and send them across the roman empire to

1788
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,000
deliver the message

1789
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,200
now you know you you take your you know

1790
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
pocket distraction rectangle

1791
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,799
and you click the button on it and it

1792
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,640
takes a picture and

1793
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,640
in an eye blink it's encrypted so

1794
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,799
thoroughly that if all the hydrogen and

1795
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:09,119
the

1796
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,280
atoms in the universe were computers and

1797
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,720
they did nothing until the end of the

1798
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,480
universe but try and guess the key

1799
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,319
that we would run out of universe like a

1800
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,599
long time

1801
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,480
before we ran out of possible keys and

1802
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,119
so

1803
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,079
we have many options for privacy that

1804
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,440
weren't there before

1805
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,240
people may be bad judges of when they

1806
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,520
should have privacy and when they

1807
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,040
shouldn't people might

1808
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,599
allow other people to know stuff that

1809
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,960
they come to regret

1810
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,400
or they might keep secrets from people

1811
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,240
who could help them you know

1812
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,720
speaking as the father of a 13 year old

1813
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,160
i'm here to tell you

1814
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,400
that kids really appreciate their need

1815
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,520
to have privacy

1816
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,040
but they fail to understand who they

1817
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,440
need privacy from my kid is 13

1818
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,079
and has already had issues where she

1819
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,240
shared stuff online with friends that

1820
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,640
turned out not to be wisely shared and

1821
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
in part the reason that

1822
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,319
it was as bad as it was is that she kept

1823
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,680
she took measures to stop me from

1824
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,520
knowing about it because

1825
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,160
she lacks the context to understand that

1826
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,680
i'm on her side and that her friends

1827
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,440
aren't necessarily on her side or at

1828
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,599
least not as reliably as i am

1829
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
and so people might make unwise choices

1830
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,720
about privacy

1831
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,680
but privacy is very important privacy is

1832
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,000
how it is that we got to a place

1833
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
where we were able to make social change

1834
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,200
social progress

1835
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,640
you know within living memory like there

1836
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,319
are people alive today

1837
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,160
who remember when so-called interracial

1838
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,599
marriage was a crime

1839
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:32,799
there are people alive today who

1840
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,280
remember when being gay was a crime

1841
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,680
there are people alive today everyone on

1842
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,280
this call who remember when smoking

1843
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,000
marijuana

1844
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,920
was a crime it's not where i am here in

1845
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,119
in california

1846
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,480
i can't because i'm an immigrant and

1847
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,559
it's a federally scheduled substance but

1848
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,079
my american neighbors can and i can

1849
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,960
smell it over the fence of an evening

1850
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,200
and the way that we got from there to

1851
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,160
here

1852
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,280
was not spontaneous it took effort

1853
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,599
people who had secrets about themselves

1854
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,599
people who had things about themselves

1855
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,319
that were not socially acceptable were

1856
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,400
able to keep those secrets

1857
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,880
and then tell other people about them

1858
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,680
share them

1859
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,480
right be private at the time and manner

1860
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,760
of their choosing

1861
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,319
and people were able to wait until they

1862
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,680
were away for a fishing weekend with

1863
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,400
their dad

1864
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,520
to to come out as being queer or to

1865
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,359
wait until they were in company with

1866
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,960
with other people whose judgment they

1867
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,760
trusted

1868
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,520
to talk about their relationship with

1869
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,280
someone who was racialized in a

1870
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
different way to themselves

1871
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,440
and and by building those alliances with

1872
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,400
people

1873
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,520
who had a different set of

1874
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,960
risks of social sanction uh people who

1875
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,640
didn't have secrets that they were

1876
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,960
keeping from the wider society

1877
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,520
and by building uh networks with each

1878
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,400
other

1879
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,079
those people who had those disfavored

1880
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,000
characteristics or views

1881
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,640
were able to make common cause with one

1882
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,520
another

1883
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,680
and were able to affect gross social

1884
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,240
change massive social change to the

1885
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,200
point now where

1886
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,400
we view some of the uh ideas that we

1887
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
held in those days

1888
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,720
not just as wrong but as a source of

1889
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,839
shame

1890
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,599
as a as a thing that we need to

1891
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,480
repudiate and make reparations for

1892
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,400
and that is a remarkable set of changes

1893
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,799
to have made within our lifetime

1894
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,720
and the corollary of that is unless you

1895
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,400
think that we have attained perfection

1896
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
today right unless you think

1897
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,599
that in 2071 and 50 years

1898
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,200
your grandkids will sit down at the

1899
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,960
christmas table with you

1900
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,559
say tell me again grandma tell me again

1901
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,440
grandpa how was it that in 2021

1902
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,960
we had attained social perfection and

1903
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,480
haven't had to change any of our social

1904
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,079
attitudes since

1905
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,680
then you should probably guess

1906
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
that one or more people that you love

1907
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,319
you really care about whose happiness

1908
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,359
is important to you and when they're sad

1909
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,440
you can't be truly happy

1910
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,880
that some of those people have a secret

1911
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,240
they've never told you some of those

1912
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,960
people have

1913
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,920
never been their authentic selves with

1914
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,040
you

1915
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,760
and unless uh we have a private space

1916
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,559
where they can come forward and tell you

1917
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,000
that in confidence

1918
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,200
at the moment in manner of their

1919
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
choosing then

1920
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,000
the case won't be that they simply one

1921
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,799
day

1922
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,559
throw caution to the wind and announce

1923
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,640
to the world who they really are

1924
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,319
the case is far more likely to be that

1925
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,079
they'll go to their grave with a great

1926
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,480
sorrow in their heart and that part of

1927
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,599
that sorrow will be down

1928
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,520
to you to the fact that they were never

1929
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,200
able to be their authentic selves with

1930
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,640
you

1931
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,000
and so for that reason we need to

1932
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,760
preserve privacy

1933
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,359
and if you happen to feel like you were

1934
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,119
lucky enough to have been born on first

1935
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,880
base or second base or third base or

1936
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,440
maybe even

1937
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,640
a slide for home run and you don't have

1938
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,040
anything that you need to keep secret

1939
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,960
that is the reason you should be using

1940
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,559
privacy technology

1941
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,280
because as uh george points out if the

1942
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,760
only people who use privacy technologies

1943
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,440
are the people who have some reason to

1944
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,960
fear social sanction

1945
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,319
then they will experience social

1946
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,319
sanction for the mere reason

1947
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,920
of using privacy technologies we have a

1948
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,799
a duty to each other to the people we

1949
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:11,839
love

1950
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,079
to strangers who haven't come yet who

1951
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,240
will either be burdened or unburdened

1952
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,000
of something fundamental about who they

1953
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,079
are we have a duty to maintain

1954
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,160
that privacy and the way that you and i

1955
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,240
can maintain that privacy today

1956
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,039
is by using privacy tools even when and

1957
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,640
especially when we have nothing to hide

1958
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,000
thank you corey uh it has been a

1959
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,359
wonderful hour with you

to jump off and take

1962
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,880

1963
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,480
hour with questions

1964
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,640
