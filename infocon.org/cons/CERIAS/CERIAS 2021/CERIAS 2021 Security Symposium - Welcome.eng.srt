research and cyber security not only

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
just at

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,040
purdue and the collaborators

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
and faculty and students at purdue

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
but with our partners overall so i'm

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800

um

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,360
hope uh this is a kick off to a great

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,879
two days

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,640
hopefully next year we'll be able to see

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
everybody in person once again

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
but the virtual format does give us the

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
ability to reach out i think to far more

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
people as well

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
i'm going to just kick things off with

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
just some really exciting advances here

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
at purdue overall

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
um with a couple of quick facts and

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
um for those of you who haven't been

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
tracking the news we had record

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
enrollment coming out of covid last year

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,879
um we have just kept

84
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,159
hit 50 000 residential students and a

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,680
real differentiator for purdue

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
university is that over two-thirds of

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
those students

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
along with the academic programs are in

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,599
stem disciplines and i don't need to

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
tell anybody on the line that this is

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
fulfilling a really critical need for

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
the nation right now

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
and our work in cyber security and

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
related areas are certainly at the top

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,599
of the list

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
but not only

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
do we continue to grow in scale

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
we maintain a very

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
high

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
ranking in terms of our overall strength

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
both across engineering and cyber

102
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
security in particular both at the

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
undergraduate and graduate levels and so

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
this provides a very robust

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
pipeline of students for the future

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
i'm very proud to say that we are also

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,239
we also have a diverse population of

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,399
students and faculty fifth in the nation

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,279
for degrees to undergraduates as well as

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,639
phd

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,919
women engineers and were recently ranked

112
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
the fifth most innovative university if

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
you've been to campus recently

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
you'll see everything from autonomous

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
vehicles to other

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,360
so to speak living lab exercises

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
so what we like to say is you want to

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
try something new come to purdue and i

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,639
think it really underscores

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
the culture that we're promoting in

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,000
terms of

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,639
a hands-on minds on approach to the

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
research that we do

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
as well as learning

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
i also thought i would just provide a

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
high level overview of some very

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
exciting new strategic initiatives

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
in a time of a significant challenge for

129
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
the nation and for higher education in

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
general

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
we have

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
you know continued to make deep

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
investments i'm going to share our some

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
of our purdue next moves investments but

135
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,160
as we were making some decisions going

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
into this calendar year we took a look

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
at our overall portfolio which i'm just

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
showing a snapshot of right here you can

139
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
see that approximately 60 percent

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
of our recent research expenditures out

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,520
of a total of over 690 million

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
um were from the federal government

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,919
but a very

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,520
substantially growing part of our

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
portfolio has been our direct engagement

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,639
with industry and the relationships that

147
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
we have with industry together with the

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
federal government really looking at

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
that triad between the academic federal

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
and industry partnerships which i know

151
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
many of you are active active

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
participants and

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
as we took a look at our overall

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
portfolio we noted that as a very a

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
strong stem university

156
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
that we have opportunities we have

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
greater opportunities to work more

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
closely with our mission-driven agencies

159
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
in the federal government sector

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
particularly agencies like the

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
department of defense intelligence

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
community homeland security and others

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
and as a result of that

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
with the support of president daniels

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
and the board of trustees we launched

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,680
our purdue next moves

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,319
where over 110 million dollars is going

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,199
to be invested over the next five years

169
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
um to support some very significant

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,240
advancements um in

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
key areas of national security and

172
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,759
technology

173
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,880
and this will include as i will show

174
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
investments in core infrastructure

175
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
people and state-of-the-art facilities

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
but it's very important that as we

177
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
looked at the potential opportunities

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
we made a strategic decision to focus on

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
areas of deep

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
strength where

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
as we look at the

182
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,759
the needs of our partners and the

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
federal government

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
aligning with some of our state

185
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
priorities and also with our deep

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
industry partners um we chose four

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
strategic areas of focus and what what

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,639
you can see here is that cyber security

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
is one of our top four uh the the images

190
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
on the right highlight some of our deep

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
strengths um and long-standing

192
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,720
investments and core capabilities where

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080
you see many of our facilities at scale

194
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
ranging from

195
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
our academic propulsion lab

196
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,479
to our nanofabrication facility

197
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
um and some of the advanced hypersonic

198
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
test facilities here are the mach 6

199
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
quiet wind tunnel which is one of only

200
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
two in the country

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
and so again the takeaway here is the

202
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,560
purdue coming out of covet in times when

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
other universities

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,759
were not

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,280
in such a fortunate

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,639
position

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
we are doubling down on our strengths

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,599
and making a commitment of investment in

209
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
order to

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
build out a more extensive base with

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,319
which to expand our research initiatives

212
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,840
i would also like to highlight that

213
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
there's a very significant investment

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
that really sits side by side in this

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
complementary in teaching and learning

216
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
as well as

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
recommendations that came out of a

218
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,719
year-long effort

219
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,919
that was

220
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
a campus-wide effort that was called our

221
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
equity task force and we're making over

222
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
a 30 million dollar investment um to

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
diversify our faculty

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
graduate student and undergraduate

225
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
student population as well as our staff

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
population

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,600
um to really embrace uh once again our

228
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,399
core

229
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
land grant mission

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,399
and to ensure a a public education um to

231
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
a diverse community that's

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
representative of our state and of our

233
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
nation

234
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,040
so that 30 million investment again um i

235
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
think uh will will continue to support

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
the efforts that are underway and i hope

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,160
for our industry and federal partners

238
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
who might be on the line that you will

239
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
join us um in

240
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
uh really um you know underscoring and

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
emphasizing um some of our critical gaps

242
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
and talent needs and um we'll be

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,480
partners in our on our efforts um as we

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
again continue to diversify our

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
student base

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
um i just like to highlight

247
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
some of our you know real proud

248
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
accomplishments and cyber security

249
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,959
starting with the founding of our main

250
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
cyber security center called sirius

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
in 1998 really dating back to the early

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,959
1990s

253
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,399
so it was one of the original seven

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
nsa and dhs labs again it has maintained

255
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
a national leadership role um and as an

256
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,120
academic a

257
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
center of excellence in cyber security

258
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
um one of the things that as i joined

259
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,880
purdue that has been really impressive

260
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
about the cyber activities at purdue is

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
that it's not just in one department or

262
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,279
one college we have over 100 and 150

263
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,000
faculty from across 20 academic

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
departments who are deeply engaged

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
so this spans from computer science all

266
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
the way to

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
liberal arts and humanities and

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,440
again we have programs

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
and externally funded programs that are

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,480
supporting faculty and students in a

271
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
truly interdisciplinary way so over 3

272
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
000 cyber focused students

273
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,079
and

274
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,240
moving beyond research but really

275
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,560
touching on the core educational

276
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
principles as well

277
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
so sirius serves importantly as the

278
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,399
portal for all of our cyber security

279
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,880
initiatives at purdue

280
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
um we did have the first accredited

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
cyber security graduate degree program

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
in the late 1990s

283
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
um and

284
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
over that time and today and to today

285
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,839
you can see that the range of focus

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
areas continues to grow and they align

287
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,720
um and track in real time where we see

288
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
the greatest needs um across

289
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
our industry partners and our federal

290
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,680
partners and so as needs change um the

291
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
serious center is there

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,399
really tracking those changes

293
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,200
a very impressive over 300 million

294
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
dollars in active programs uh that are

295
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
supporting our cyber research and sirius

296
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
itself um is

297
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
really the home to our industry-driven

298
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
partnership uh program

299
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,200
one of the

300
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
uh core

301
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
uh strengths is really thinking about

302
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,760
the interface between

303
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
the virtual and the physical world

304
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
and considering cyber security in those

305
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,480
application driven areas and many of the

306
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
programs are focused in those

307
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
very recently

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
we

309
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
became home to a strong purdue sandia

310
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
collaborative

311
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
effort in a cyber physical a test bed

312
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
and that's prominently displayed

313
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,920
having

314
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
performers directly from sandia working

315
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
hand in hand with our faculty and

316
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
students here at purdue

317
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,600
and again just to underscore uh that we

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,079
maintain a very very strong national

319
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,120
ranking

320
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,560
in our overall efforts in cyber security

321
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,880
um the strategic partnership uh here

322
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
we're just showing a few of the many

323
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
strategic partners from across of many

324
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,880
different industry sectors you can see

325
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,800
uh defense

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
contractors you can see

327
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,600
major semiconductor companies

328
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
pharmaceutical company companies and

329
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,880
beyond as well as our federal partners

330
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,959
and so bringing together

331
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
the input and the strengths from these

332
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,160
very

333
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,800
broad ranging industry sectors again

334
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
really builds a vibrant environment here

335
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
at purdue and with our other academic

336
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,040
partners

337
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,920
um we're very proud that just over uh

338
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
the last year we've continued to receive

339
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
very significant investments

340
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
that are combining federal and industry

341
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
support

342
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,040
including a 7.5 million dollar award

343
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
that's part of the doe cyber security

344
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
manufacturing innovation institute

345
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,199
that's in partnership with the

346
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
department of energy um you can see

347
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
additional programs growing from nasa as

348
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,760
well as the office of naval research so

349
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
again just to highlight these are just a

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
few of the many

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
programs

352
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,680
that continue to receive support

353
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,519
within the serious

354
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
we're working hard to get the word out

355
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
and so it's part of

356
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,519
enhancing our strategic communication

357
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,240
i hope that you remain in touch

358
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,120
with our active news and social media

359
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
feeds

360
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
we're really building a drum beat of

361
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,040
communication that's highlighting our

362
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
cyber security efforts um one that i'd

363
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,560
like to highlight in particular is the

364
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
new rolls-royce

365
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,240
cyber technology consortium where purdue

366
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
and carnegie mellon were the first two

367
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
university founding members building off

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,120
other successful initiatives

369
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
with other industry partners and so

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,959
again this is filling a core need

371
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
of industry working hand-in-hand in

372
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
different application domains and with

373
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
our federal partners

374
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,279
um as part of the purdue next moves i

375
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
highlighted our strategic area of focus

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
in national security and defense where

377
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,279
cyber security is one of our top four

378
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,639
priorities

379
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
um i'd also like to highlight

380
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,120
that as purdue considers how we continue

381
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,160
to support the nation in building out

382
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
the work with mission-driven agencies

383
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,160
we felt that it was time to invest in a

384
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
platform which is an affiliated

385
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
non-profit

386
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,279
research arm of the university that we

387
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,680
are calling the purdue applied research

388
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,040
institute and this institute

389
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
will have a very strong base in cyber

390
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
security and will invest in researchers

391
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,199
critical infrastructure and

392
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,440
one-of-a-kind facilities

393
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
that are aligned

394
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,440
with the core strengths of purdue

395
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
both our research education and outreach

396
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,240
in order to drive

397
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
the our ability to solve bigger and more

398
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
complex problems in interdisciplinary

399
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,320
areas for um a safer nation and world

400
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,279
and with that um i want to highlight not

401
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,759
only investments in people but really

402
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,920
building out a robust and vibrant

403
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
ecosystem

404
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
um this image shows

405
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
the continued expansion

406
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
of our discovery park district which

407
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
sits at the western side of campus

408
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
immediately adjacent to the academic

409
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,360
core what we're showing on the left

410
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
is the build out of the hub of our

411
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
interdisciplinary research activities

412
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
and if you can see my cursor um we are

413
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,199
establishing one building uh that will

414
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,440
support or be the front door for our

415
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
national security and defense

416
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,440
initiatives at the university

417
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
as part of that um it is important that

418
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
we enhance our capabilities to support

419
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
classified and restricted research and

420
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
with this investment we will be building

421
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
out those those capabilities and i'd be

422
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,119
happy to talk to industry partners um

423
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,839
who would like a more in-depth um

424
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
understanding of some of the facilities

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
that we will be bringing online as part

426
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
of that investment

427
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,640
um what i'm showing to the right is the

428
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
convergence building and it's truly

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,400
an area that sits adjacent to our

430
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
interdisciplinary research activities

431
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
some of our core labs and facilities

432
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
where we provide space

433
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,799
to

434
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,840
house

435
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
not only our researchers but to provide

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,160
a location proximate to campus for our

437
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,080
industry federal and state partners

438
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
we are also building out enhanced

439
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
capabilities

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,320
with state-of-the-art facilities

441
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,000
we were very fortunate to receive

442
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,360
funding from the air force as well as a

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
donation from northrop grumman

444
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,720
um to

445
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
construct verify

446
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
and bring online as a national asset a

447
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
two additional state-of-the-art

448
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
hypersonics wind tunnels which if you've

449
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
been following the news

450
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
right behind

451
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,679
cyber and cyber physical system security

452
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
hypersonics is a key area of technology

453
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,440
that of course builds on these core

454
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
capabilities so we are very much looking

455
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
forward to hosting

456
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,440
as a national asset to the country

457
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
one of the locations in the nation that

458
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
will support advanced test and

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,679
evaluation

460
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
we're also building out additional

461
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,600
capacity in advanced manufacturing not

462
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,559
only for hypersonics but thinking about

463
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,480
the ongoing and enhanced support of the

464
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,520
digitalization of

465
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,919
industry oftentimes known as industry

466
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,720
4.0 and as you can see one of the major

467
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
programs that is being driven out of

468
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
sirius is this um interaction with the

469
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
department of energy in this critical

470
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,919
area as just one of many examples so

471
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,080
again with that um we really appreciate

472
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
um your participation

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,120
in uh to then in the event um over the

474
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
next couple of days the serious

475
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
symposium

476
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
and um i really hope you enjoy

477
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,679
the engagement with the panels

478
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
and as of course as always with our very

479
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,160
talented students and partners so uh

480
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
thanks thanks joel and the organizers

481
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
for giving me the opportunity to provide

482
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,399
this um brief introduction

483
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,199
you
