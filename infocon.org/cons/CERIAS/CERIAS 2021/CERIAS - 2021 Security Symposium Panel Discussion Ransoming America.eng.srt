and then at the end we'll take question

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
from audience in the last 15 minutes so

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
let me start with the definition of

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
ransomware

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
according to the cyber security and

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
infrastructure security agency

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
definition ransomware is an

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
ever-evolving form of malware designed

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
to encrypt files on a device rendering

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
any files in the system that rely on

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
them unusable

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,759
malicious actor then demand ransom in

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,880
exchange for this decryption so this is

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
the definition of ransomware ransomware

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
impacts um business processes and leave

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
organization without the data they need

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
to operate and deliver mission critical

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,080
services

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
in the recent colonial pipeline

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
ransomware attack the victims were not

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
just colonial pipeline company which

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
paid the request to ransom but also

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
ordinary gas consumers like many of us

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,680
who experienced long line and higher

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
price at gas station

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
ransomware as a type of cyber malware is

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
not technically new there have been many

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
research and development effort in the

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,720
past decade to address land server

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,760
detection prevention investigation and

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
recovery

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,680
however ransomware attacks seem to be

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,720
trending awkward in recent years this

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,239
indicates that defense against

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,480
ransomware is not just a technical

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
problem instead it is a challenge that

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,280
needs to be addressed from multiple

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,319
fronts for example technology policy

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,800
international politics finance and

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
insurance education workforce

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,760
development and public awareness

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
these challenges

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,560
make today's panel a very timely one we

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
have invited panelists from cyber

85

vulnerabilities in computer system

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
now now i would like to invite each

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
panelist to give a two three minute

128
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
state position statement or ransomware

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
um

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,479
let's start with

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,160
uh simon hunt

132
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
i so i think as many of you know

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
my role in mastercard is to protect our

134
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
franchise so i am deeply interested in

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
anything that affects the world's banks

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
the world's merchants the world's card

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
process from from acting properly

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
because it affects us as society

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
i think we all intrinsically know that

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,479
all the losses in the merchants and the

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
stores and the banking system

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
that changes the price of goods and

143
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
services that we buy so all those costs

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
affect us individually so this is a deep

145
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
a deep problem

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
um

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
my position is that ransomware is just

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,759
another form of malware

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
all the same tactics that we've been

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
dealing with for the last 30 years

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
stopping malware are the tactics to stop

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
ransomware you know at the simplest

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,479
state ransomware is

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,520
how do i get somebody to click something

155
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,360
to how do i get a computer to run a

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,479
program

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,680
all the things that stopped that

158
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
happening stop ransomware the reason

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,080
ransomware is particularly evil is it's

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
directly funding the global cyber crime

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
industry it's 5.2 trillion dollars i

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
think is the today's number

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
40 of that money we know thanks to the

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
research happening in places like

165
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
university of surrey forty percent of

166
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
the money gets plowed into further crime

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
to guns trafficking human prostitution

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
uh international terrorism it's funding

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
huge social evils

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
and

171
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
to wrap up my position

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
i am deeply worried that companies feel

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
that they can buy their way out of a

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
ransomware problem by funding the very

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
criminals who will then use that money

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
to attack another victim i am deeply

177
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,319
concerned of that behavior

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
i'll pass the baton

179
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
thank you so much simon hunt so

180
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
next is i would like to invite

181
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
chester win wineski

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
thank you thayer uh

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
you know building on what simon said uh

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
of course his organization mastercard is

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
part of the traditional financial system

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
and until bitcoin ransomware really

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,639
couldn't get a foothold as the kind of

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,759
problem it is now because the

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
traditional financial system

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
shuts this stuff down and if we go back

191
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
i mean ransomware the first ransomware

192
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
was in 1989 it never really went away

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
but the problem with perpetrating the

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
crime was collecting the money like you

195
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,599
couldn't collect millions of dollars the

196
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,160
way you can now and you know criminals

197
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,599
used uh

198
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
premium rate sms in russia to do

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,759
ransomware crimes we've seen

200
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
gift cards being used but it was all

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
small scale stuff you're talking 50 gift

202
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
cards 25 here 100 on a premium rate sms

203
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,879
phone call to unlock your boot loader

204
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
this kind of thing all the way up until

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
bitcoin in 2008

206
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
and at that time the companies like

207
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
mastercard and visa and american express

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
were helping us combat other scam crimes

209
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,720
like fake antivirus and things where

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
they were trying to use the traditional

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
payment processing networks but they

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
kept getting stomped out

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
because they couldn't process credit

214
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,319
cards and you can't convince grandma to

215
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
buy windows antivirus 2008 for 99 if she

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
can't pay for it with visa and

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
mastercard right so the criminals were

218
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,879
really struggling on processing the

219
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
payments until until bitcoin and so i

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
think it's it's very difficult to talk

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
about ransomware without talking about

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,000
um

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
i don't want to call it anonymized

224
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
payment technologies but

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
uh with you know blockchain

226
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
decentralized payment technologies that

227
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
have no ability to claw back money no

228
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,839
ability to really uh meaningfully apply

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
financial regulations by design

230
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
and that really um changed these crimes

231
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,039
right because the amount of money

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,440
funneling into the system when it was

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
99 a victim and 200 victim and or for

234
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
that matter 75 cents a victim if you're

235
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
talking about selling computers for spam

236
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
bots and things like this that occurred

237
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
so much through the early 2000s and 20

238
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,360
teens

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
completely transformed when suddenly the

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
same effort to commit the crime

241
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
could yield two three ten million

242
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,440
dollars

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,959
or even tens of thousands of dollars in

244
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,519
in the smaller attack cases so

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,440
that's been the transformative thing and

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,040
as much as technology's a part of this

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
we have to try to look at the financial

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
side of it as well because

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
there's never going to be a network that

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
has no vulnerability to someone getting

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
a basic foothold in and that doesn't

252
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
mean we can't defend ourselves

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,200
but uh applying that ubiquitously across

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,959
all organizations in the world is

255
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
unrealistic

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
we need to take the approach of limiting

257
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,399
their opportunity technically and

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
limiting their opportunities financially

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
in order to try to get a grasp on this

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
thank you so much

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
and the next i will invite

262
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
santiago areas

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
right uh and i'll build on uh everything

264
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,680
that has been uh spoken about so far uh

265
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
although from different perspectives i'm

266
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
more of an academic

267
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
uh

268
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
we did mention that ransomware

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
technically speaking is mostly an

270
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
unsophisticated type of attack that

271
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
stated almost 40 years ago

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
and the fundamental mechanisms that make

273
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
this this work haven't really changed

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
throughout the years

275
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,519
my position is that

276
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
even though this is a fact

277
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
it doesn't really surface uh the real

278
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
problematic which is we're identifying

279
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
how vulnerable the whole software

280
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,760
ecosystem is

281
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
as a as a messy interconnected network

282
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
of uh actors and

283
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
technical elements and i think this is

284
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
this is where we're really falling short

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
uh we are not going to be plugging a

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
hole like ransomware if we don't

287
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
understand that there's a critical cyber

288
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
infrastructure out there

289
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
that really doesn't have any sort of

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
compliance requirements followed or like

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
the proper mechanism set in place

292
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,959
or even a uh a vision of a like

293
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,760
a nationwide uh

294
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
position to react to ransomware as a is

295
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,279
a commitment

296
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
say uh in the same way that the zero

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
tolerance policies were enacted on say

298
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,480
terrorism or uh

299
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,839
uh or

300
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
many like acts of of that nature um i'm

301
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
also trying to bring in the notion of uh

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,040
after colonial pipeline and solarwinds

303
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,279
uh the executive order i think it's 14

304
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,640
028 really tried to set forth a new way

305
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
to address these problems that uh that

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
also academics as practitioners need to

307
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
start thinking about how this is not an

308
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
isolated problem of oh let's shut down

309
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
their payment networks or let's come up

310
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
with better signatures for antiviruses

311
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
but rather how can we develop an

312
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
ecosystem in which we are as fundamental

313
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
as the power grid as fundamental

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,120
as the as the loyal pipelines and uh

315
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
really really start trading all these

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
interconnected systems as something that

317
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
can really really cause uh large amounts

318
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
of damage to

319
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
the nation's fabric

320
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
thank you so much

321
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,519
um now i would like to invite arvind

322
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
missierie

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
supposing statement

324
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,839
hey

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
hey there uh as i mentioned before uh i

326
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
work on system and software security

327
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
so my interest in ransomware

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
is basically iot ransomware so like the

329
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
traditional ransomware we have been

330
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,279
dealing with uh or like the ransomware

331
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
like high profile ransomware are all

332
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,600
desktop machines and they

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
take control of this high profile data

334
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
by encrypting or shutting down the

335
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,519
system or blocking the system whereas in

336
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,040
iot space

337
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
the impact is much severe right like we

338
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,959
could have like we have straight access

339
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
to the physical world and we may get

340
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
locked out of our house or the baby

341
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
monitor might get turned off

342
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
and the ransom can be demanded where

343
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
there's a high chance of hit rate

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
because now it's your life in question

345
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
and so my work

346
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
uh

347
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,040
is developing new hardware assisted

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
techniques like by using trusted

349
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
execution environment to detect and

350
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
prevent these ransomware attacks

351
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,160
so uh specifically we can actually see

352
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
that most of the iot devices are

353
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
communicated through smartphone so can

354
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
we make sure that all the physical

355
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
actions that the

356
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
firmware does on an iot device is

357
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
through this through a smartphone

358
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
so having this trusted chain

359
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,399
on the physical activities done by iot

360
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,720
devices as a way to prevent transfer

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
attacks on iot devices is my like main

362
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
area of research

363
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,680
and i'm also interested in like what

364
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
santiago mentioned about the patching

365
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
practices or the cybersec the security

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
of infrastructure

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
that are have been used in the

368
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
organizations right can we have

369
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
a common baseline or can we even have a

370
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
evaluation metric to know how secure the

371
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
systems are and how secure are the

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
machines that hold critical

373
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,959
infrastructure is

374
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,880
or can we like

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
can we shift the

376
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
critical data to another infrastructure

377
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,600
where we have

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
much more like patched machines because

379
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
most of the ransomware attacks they use

380
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
like one day vulnerabilities

381
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,320
and the fact that

382
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,360
these ransomwares have an easy way to

383
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
entry just because some organizations

384
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,639
don't apply patches on time it's really

385
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,680
worrying

386
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
so

387
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
i'm like my idea is to understand like

388
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,279
what what makes these organizations not

389
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
like those patches on time and how can

390
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
we improve it

391
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
well thank you so much for the position

392
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
statement

393
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,880
now i have a number of questions to ask

394
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
panelists for their comments and advice

395
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
despite advances in ransomware research

396
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,560
and development

397
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
why do ransomware attacks keep coming

398
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,320
back

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
is it because of the more advanced

400
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
attack strategies and tactics or slower

401
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,399
progress in developing deploying rent

402
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
software defenses

403
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,800
as

404
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
simon said before

405
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
that we have seen the first model in 19

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
in like 19 i believe in 1989 so after

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
that now we in 2021 uh since then

408
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,440
have we not done enough to stop all

409
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,519
those ransomware attack so i would like

410
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,199
to invite

411
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,480
simon

412
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,279
to

413
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,560
comment on this question

414
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,880
uh i think we're just really bad at

415
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,600
cyber security

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
if i look at uh and chester i think

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
we'll have some much better data here so

418
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
chester i'll set this up for you but the

419
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
attacks that i see are

420
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,240
password stuffing fishing and patching

421
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
um

422
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
i'm not saying everyone falls victim to

423
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,480
that there are certainly some targeted

424
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
dedicated attacks against large

425
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,199
organizations where criminals

426
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
put time and effort into investigation

427
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
you know

428
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
doing the due diligence

429
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,079
understanding how to penetrate before

430
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
they launch the attack but most

431
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,320
companies uh like i think about lewis

432
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
and for instance the uh the city of

433
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,519
lewiston

434
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
it was uh password stuffing uh if i

435
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
think about um

436
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
i can't remember the name of the city

437
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,240
but there was another city more recently

438
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,440
it was fishing

439
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,160
so really basic stuff you know and if i

440
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
send you an email saying hey click here

441
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
to encrypt everything on your computer

442
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
i bet like one out of 100 people will

443
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,920
click it if i put if i call it click

444
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,240
here to see puppies i'll get 10 out of

445
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
100 people to click it we are just lousy

446
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,440
at the basics right now um and the

447
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
criminals know it the criminals can do

448
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
global scale uh

449
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,519
tracking of

450
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,759
vulnerabilities they know everybody's

451
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
username and password from all the

452
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
breaches and they can just push a button

453
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
and trigger that and and reel us in

454
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,279
so

455
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
that's that's my opinion and but i would

456
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
leave it to chester who no doubt will

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,839
have

458
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,040
numbers okay

459
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
thanks simon i i i don't know if i have

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
hard numbers but i mean we we did a

461
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
outside survey commissioned by like real

462
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
survey people not just like customers of

463
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
ours kind of thing uh 4 500

464
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
organizations um in january

465
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,280
and uh 30 37 of them had fallen victim

466
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,599
to some sort of a ransom attack in the

467
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
last year which is an astounding number

468
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,039
when you consider

469
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
that this was across all industry bases

470
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
you know all verticals etc and while it

471
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
varied by vertical i mean healthcare and

472
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
local government and education were

473
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,880
harder hit than media and technology and

474
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
some other verticals the the fact of the

475
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
matter is it didn't vary much i mean it

476
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,559
was literally well over a third for

477
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,640
every single sector and then 47 of those

478
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
that were attacked were successful in

479
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
defending themselves meaning they were

480
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
able to stop it before the files were

481
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
encrypted or the data was stolen

482
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,720
so

483
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
that's good i mean it's bad it's only

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
less than half but it's good in that the

485
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
previous year it was only 20

486
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,039
so we went from 20 to 47 in a year of

487
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
organizations that were starting to be

488
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
better at

489
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
defending themselves after the attacker

490
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
got a foothold

491
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
but that getting the foothold to what

492
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,240
simon's talking about is the problem

493
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
it's just uh i mean it's astonishing

494
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
there's no

495
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
there's not a lot of skill involved

496
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
uh of the last three victims i talked to

497
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
that used our rapid response service one

498
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
of them had the criminal got in through

499
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,640
a 10 year old unpatched cold fusion

500
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,679
server

501
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
so not a year out of date not a month

502
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
out of date 10 years out of date um

503
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,840
another one

504
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
the infrastructure the criminals got

505
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
into was in their windows server

506
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
environment and they had our software on

507
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
all of their endpoints they had all our

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
software on all of their servers but it

509
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
was turned off on the servers so not

510
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,360
only were we not able to protect them

511
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
but on top of that that meant windows

512
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
defender was disabled so it's even worse

513
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,400
than not having anything on there at all

514
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
because if you load a security tool and

515
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
you set the policy to null you've

516
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
actually reduced the security of windows

517
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,520
and the security tool because now you've

518
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
got nothing

519
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
and this is the part of the issue is

520
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,120
it's it's the ubiquity of policy right

521
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
you can have 10 000 computers and 9 800

522
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
of them can be in perfect

523
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
condition it's not that we don't have

524
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
the technology to stop ransomware from

525
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
encrypting computers it's been around

526
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,200
for a long time and we're all actively

527
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,559
developing pretty

528
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
good sophisticated stuff i've seen great

529
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,919
papers in academia about things that

530
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,200
work very similar to things that we're

531
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,000
doing

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the solution's there it's just it has to

533
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
be everywhere and if the servers where

534
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,600
all the crown jewels are held or the one

535
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
unprotected asset

536
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
that's kind of a giant problem and

537
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
for another presentation i'm doing

538
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
yesterday i was spent the day on the

539
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
dark web looking at um what are called

540
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
initial access brokers people who get

541
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
that initial foothold and then sell the

542
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
victim on to a criminal to be ransomed

543
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
and this you know the one forum i logged

544
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
into yesterday had 12 000 open rdp

545
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
accounts for sale before between five

546
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
and twelve us dollars each i could pick

547
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,880
by industry by country by ip address by

548
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
provider

549
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
which victim i wanted um and so when

550
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
it's that easy it's not even about

551
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
fishing i mean certainly phishing is

552
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
another vector

553
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
but the vast majority of this is

554
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
unpatched firewalls unpatched vpn open

555
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
rdp access to the internet

556
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
and um

557
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
and i don't need to even i don't even

558
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
need to scan the internet to find

559
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,799
victims i could just go to someone else

560
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,919
and pay them six dollars and they'll

561
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,400
hand me one

562
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,559
oh

563
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,640
that's that's really interesting

564
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
information

565
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
um

566
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
because that's that's most of the time

567
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,679
it happens you know because sometimes

568
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
like we have all those tools available

569
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,679
all the products are already there but

570
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,200
somehow

571
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
they are disabled or maybe they are

572
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
they're not working they're not

573
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,520
functioning or maybe sometimes we have a

574
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
greater system available but those are

575
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
not patched you know

576
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,919
sometimes like we we always spend

577
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,000
hundreds of dollars to buy a new laptop

578
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
or buy a new computer but we cannot buy

579
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
a software to like antivirus software

580
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,919
you know and to put it on there

581
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,960
so

582
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
thank you so much

583
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
next i will go to santiago

584
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
for

585
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
yeah i just wanted to echo uh

586
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
what's been said i i was very surprised

587
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
earlier on i did some investigation

588
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
about the configure uh

589
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
it is not a piece of ransomware but it

590
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
was essentially a botnet uh and uh

591
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,799
i remember how surprised it was to see

592
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,640
that it was like on the top 10 uh

593
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
malware uh

594
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
families on for a bunch of decades

595
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,320
but you look at the underlying cde

596
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,880
that's uh used to to spread and it's a

597
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
it's a cv from 2008

598
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
uh that's widely documented that's

599
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
widely passed by windows and it just so

600
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
happened that this thing was still

601
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
spreading like wildfire

602
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
um so it is true that there's a there's

603
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
an issue of propagating patches and uh

604
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
it is interesting also to consider

605
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
because microsoft itself they find like

606
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
a patch tuesday methodology

607
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
they're somewhat like the gold standard

608
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,039
of uh

609
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,880
of trying to propagate patches fast but

610
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,600
the

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
it still happens that there are systems

612
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
out there that are patched and uh what

613
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
chester was saying that well you can

614
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
have 10 10 10 000 hosts but it just

615
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
takes one for you to lose i think part

616
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
of what's missing here is the

617
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,360
the ways to assess this sort of

618
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,440
vulnerability surface i think uh or

619
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
or mechanisms to assess the security of

620
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
our network are not entirely mature and

621
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,159
they're uh they're generally

622
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,000
meant to look at the compositional

623
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
analysis right is this host safe is this

624
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
what's safe is this all safe what are my

625
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
like open ports is there like an open

626
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
rdp port here and there's just mentioned

627
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
uh but there's no way to actually

628
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
holistically look

629
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,880
at a deployment and also understand in a

630
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,600
semi to automatic way to say hey this

631
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,679
happens to be an oil pipeline we need to

632
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
take a different approach to this uh

633
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
and i think part of it is also uh

634
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
i don't want to get too too far ahead

635
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
but it also seems to me that we're uh on

636
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
a hard lack of like security

637
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
professionals on some of these pieces of

638
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,799
infrastructure

639
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,880
nobody actually thought of this because

640
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
maybe there wasn't somebody to raise

641
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
this concerns in some of these incidents

642
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,200
oh thank you so much uh now arvind

643
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,559
michelle

644
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,679
hey

645
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,720
yeah i mean

646
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
like everybody like there is very valid

647
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,159
points i like i echo with everyone

648
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,080
it's the same thing the and it's it's

649
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
interesting to know like why these

650
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,919
organizations don't follow like this

651
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,760
common sense security practices right

652
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
like what what made them not to patch

653
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
these like 10 year old cve what made

654
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,880
them not to pass this vulnerability that

655
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
was 2008 do they

656
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
do they discard the patches because

657
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,559
microsoft actually pushes patches back

658
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,240
on patch tuesday you actually get the

659
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,960
notification very bright and

660
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,720
in front of you and it'll it's very

661
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
annoying it's hard to escape that

662
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
warning and still

663
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,360
like organizations tend to miss it i

664
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
want to understand like why why

665
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,760
is like irrespective of all the

666
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,720
notifications and all the education like

667
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
everything that we do why is it not

668
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,440
reaching the end users

669
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,919
i don't know like i think that is more

670
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,720
interesting than i mean it's easy to say

671
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
okay they don't apply this common sense

672
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,279
practices but i believe these developers

673
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,559
are not

674
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,760
like the

675
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,360
they're not like

676
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
they're not naive they kind of know what

677
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
it takes but the fact that they're not

678
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,279
applying them

679
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,640
it's it's interesting i want to

680
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
understand like why especially with

681
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
victims like why were the practices not

682
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
followed like what what are these

683
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
what are their practices like why is it

684
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
the case that the

685
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
10 year old cb is not patched right

686
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,919
so i think it's incredibly easy to stand

687
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
up infrastructure easier than it has

688
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
ever been

689
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,080
and no easier to maintain it

690
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
i think any anyone in this call could go

691
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
stand up a windows server on amazon with

692
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,679
a credit card in fact you wouldn't even

693
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
need the credit card ten minutes later

694
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,120
you can have it stood up

695
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
how many but how many of us actually

696
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
know how to patch and maintain and

697
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,039
correctly configure that asset it's

698
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,400
yeah it's

699
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,880
we've been given a great power and

700
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
we lack the skill to make to look after

701
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,600
it

702
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
yeah but but i thought it was enterprise

703
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
environments it's about customization

704
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
right you look at this cold fusion

705
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
server and i i didn't go into the

706
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
details with this particular client but

707
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,760
i suspect based on previous experience

708
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
that they heavily customized their

709
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
custom code on top of the platform that

710
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
they purchased

711
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,240
and then if they every time they go to

712
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,919
apply a patch it breaks their entire

713
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,520
website and it's it's an important

714
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
e-commerce platform for their

715
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
organization and so their

716
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,320
their tendency is to either never patch

717
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
or to take an incredibly long time at

718
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
change control of testing those patches

719
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,279
because of the customization involved

720
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,880
and if you look at what most enterprise

721
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,799
companies are doing these days like we

722
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
have a whole team of full-time

723
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
developers all they do is build

724
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
salesforce stuff for us so if salesforce

725
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,480
makes a major api change it's a gigantic

726
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,799
nightmare because we've literally got 15

727
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,480
man years of code laying on top of

728
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,640
salesforce and so

729
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,559
when you look at things like windows

730
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,799
patches microsoft ship several duds over

731
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,159
the last couple years that have blown up

732
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,760
machines and blue screen them so

733
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
companies get hesitant they're like

734
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
we're waiting at least 30 days until we

735
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
see if everybody else blows up before

736
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,919
we're going to let it blow up in our

737
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
environment so part of this is the

738
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
software industry's fault we don't

739
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
deliver reliable enough patches and

740
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,360
consistent apis that don't change so

741
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,960
that organizations that need all this

742
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
custom software can reliably build it

743
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
and still consume our patches we're

744
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
instead wanting to push our newest

745
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
latest thing

746
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,919
and a new api to support all this crazy

747
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
new stuff we've developed except that

748
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
then creates breakage right so there's

749
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
responsibility on both sides of this i

750
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,279
think between independent software

751
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
vendors uh and uh consumers of that

752
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,200
software and and certainly enterprises i

753
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
feel are

754
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
doing their customizations much more

755
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,679
carefully so they don't end up in these

756
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,919
situations now but it you're trying to

757
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,480
undo 25 30 years of software development

758
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
uh to move forward for for any large

759
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,960
complicated uh organization and that's

760
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
really tough

761
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,120
uh and i think some of that uh

762
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,919
if i may oh almost like a two words in

763
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,679
your mouth i think i think it has to do

764
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,120
with the fact that

765
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
there's not a lot of accountability uh

766
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
when somebody gets hacked i don't want

767
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
to get far ahead in the conversation but

768
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
most of this uh attacks are all very

769
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,679
uninteresting like you look at equifax

770
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
it was an apache structure probability

771
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
it was uh something that

772
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,200
people were talking about and it just

773
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,919
took

774
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,679
apparently one person to go like oh i

775
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,760
wonder if this website does have that

776
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
uh or just use another scanner or

777
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
something like this uh

778
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
now i don't know and i'm not trying to

779
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
say like hey we should uh like

780
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
put up our pitchforks and go uh

781
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,679
down whatever equifax is uh physically

782
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,640
at but

783
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,880
i i wonder what what is the expectation

784
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
that we should be having when again the

785
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,960
old pipelines are really dependent on uh

786
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,399
software nowadays

787
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,679
uh

788
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
there's this old quote and i forget it

789
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
was uh who said it but it used to say

790
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
that

791
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,399
if we uh build buildings like we write

792
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,240
source code

793
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
the buildings will be brought down by a

794
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
woodpecker right

795
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,039
it is it is pretty much that

796
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
well thank you so much uh for answering

797
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
this question

798
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,039
um

799
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,679
with the discussion it seems like we

800
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,240
need to patch our system we need to make

801
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
sure that we can identify phishing

802
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,919
emails

803
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,600
from the company perspective we need to

804
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,360
make sure that they are up to date on

805
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,799
their softwares

806
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,520
and also like any of the tools that

807
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
available in machines they're supposed

808
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,600
to be in functioning and they must be

809
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
functioning uh it's pretty surprising

810
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,520
that like 40 percent 47 percent

811
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
um

812
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,200
were able to defend the attack and it

813
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,559
means the 53 percent were not able to uh

814
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,600
detect that hack and it means like if if

815
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
i'm one of those 53 percent that's

816
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399
that's a really big large number

817
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,520
and that's kind of connected with the

818
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
second question so my second question is

819
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,880
in your opinion what are some of the

820
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,039
most effective defense against

821
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
ransomware attacks do you guys have any

822
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,039
suggestion how the people like for

823
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,520
example the 51 53

824
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,919
they were not able to defend themselves

825
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
from this attack uh what's your thought

826
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,399
on

827
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
i guess i'll i'll start since it was my

828
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,520
number i threw out there but um what the

829
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
biggest difference if

830
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
between the successful and the

831
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,159
unsuccessful

832
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,080
amongst those that i talk to

833
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
is those that are

834
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
acknowledging they can't prevent which

835
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,960
means they have an active process of

836
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,799
monitoring and threat hunting

837
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,559
like they understand that they are

838
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
probably not fully patched even if they

839
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,840
intend to be there's going to be

840
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
computers that got missed there's going

841
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,960
to be reasons that certain ones couldn't

842
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,240
be updated and that they may have some

843
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,559
mitigation in place and so the companies

844
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,960
that are smart enough to recognize that

845
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
protection isn't 100

846
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,360
no matter what antivirus or firewall or

847
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,120
whatever stuff i buy

848
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
things are going to happen and when i

849
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
hear

850
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
the burglar break in the glass at the

851
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
front window of the house

852
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,520
i need to go investigate it and if i

853
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,039
investigate it it means yeah i was

854
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,080
compromised by a ransomware criminal but

855
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
the ransomware criminal is a human being

856
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,120
right these aren't automated attacks i

857
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
mean santiago's comment on conficker i

858
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
mean i could go on for hours because

859
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,120
it's a fascinating piece of malware um

860
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,760
the very first uh malware to ever employ

861
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,919
rc6 encryption even before ron rivest

862
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,440
was able to implement it

863
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,240
um fascinating stuff but the thing is

864
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
conficker was automated right conficker

865
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,320
was a worm that spread through a

866
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,240
vulnerability in rpc

867
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
and

868
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,480
when we're talking about ransomware it's

869
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
human operated so we've got this

870
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,840
advantage right the criminal actually

871
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,679
takes a few days on average seven to ten

872
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,960
days the criminals in your network

873
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
before they trigger the ransomware right

874
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,159
because they're they've got to find all

875
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,200
the servers that have the valuable

876
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,559
assets and they've got to copy all the

877
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,000
data off and they got to try to delete

878
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,279
your backups and do all these things to

879
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,559
trip you up along the way so you can't

880
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,320
recover so there's a really good chance

881
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,559
they can get their money and if it takes

882
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,600
them a week

883
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,039
from that first

884
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,880
alarm that comes into the security tools

885
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
you have if you're monitoring you've got

886
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
a whole week to find them and and and

887
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
evict them from your network right so

888
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
those 47 percent they're watching and

889
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
they went huh that's weird that doesn't

890
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
look like it's supposed to be happening

891
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,919
i'm gonna go talk to josh and see if he

892
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
opened an attachment

893
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,559
and

894
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,799
the organizations that just let the you

895
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
know the feeds fly by and are in

896
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,960
reactive mode if a user calls and says i

897
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,080
have a problem they help them but

898
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
they're not looking proactively to see

899
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,240
and investigate alerts those are the

900
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
ones that are 53 in my opinion

901
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,960
okay thank you so much

902
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,559
simon

903
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,559
yeah i think as chester says that

904
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,679
catching people you during the

905
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,080
reconnaissance phase absolutely if

906
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,919
you're sophisticated enough to do that

907
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,760
that's that's really great

908
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,360
otherwise you know the the recovery is

909
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,679
the key thing and you know a common

910
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,799
situation with people who pay or really

911
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,000
suffer downtime because of ransomware is

912
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,519
they say well we didn't have a robust

913
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,960
backup strategy

914
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
um and if you think about you know a

915
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,559
decade ago when you got malware on your

916
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
computer you you'd pick it up you take

917
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,720
it to the it guys i've got malware he

918
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,080
wouldn't try and fix it he'd just give

919
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
you another computer i'll just wipe it

920
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,279
and start again

921
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,960
now the problem is the ransomware's

922
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,799
going off your computer into the other

923
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,320
parts of the network it's doing the

924
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,600
traversal

925
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
so i encourage small companies

926
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,440
especially you know

927
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,519
do play the game everyone comes to work

928
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
and you say the building burnt down

929
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,279
what do we do

930
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,679
because ransomware is is burning of your

931
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,760
i.t infrastructure you know burnt to the

932
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
ground like who has a backup at home who

933
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,919
has the tape who has the discs that

934
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,120
we're offline yeah what is the strategy

935
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,840
and

936
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,679
that's where you start is your ability

937
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,279
to recover from a devastated cyber

938
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,200
attack is much the same as recovering

939
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,840
from a fire in your building um what

940
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,679
plans do you have have you taken that

941
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,720
seriously

942
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,039
so chester says like get catch it during

943
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,159
reconnaissance you know have your av or

944
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
your protections running everywhere know

945
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
the scope of your attack surface

946
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
and have a plan for if you miss

947
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,000
something

948
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,519
how is it not going to be business

949
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,360
devastating

950
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
one thing i want to add simon said is

951
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
we've we've noticed organizations in

952
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,600
hurricane zones earthquake zones etc are

953
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
more resilient they have a plan already

954
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,880
they know they're going to have to shut

955
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,559
down their office in florida for a week

956
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,000
every year because there's likely to be

957
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,519
a golf hurricane that's going to affect

958
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,679
them and they can just put that plan

959
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,039
when the pandemic hit everybody pulled

960
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,399
their emergency plan out for disasters

961
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,840
because everybody had to work from home

962
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,039
in a hurricane or everybody had to work

963
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,120
from home in a earthquake in san

964
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
francisco for example or here in british

965
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,919
columbia so take those disaster recovery

966
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,840
plans that you've created for natural

967
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,320
disasters and repurpose them into

968
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
ransomware response plans and they work

969
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,880
incredibly well

970
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
thank you so much yeah and i think that

971
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,559
highlights this uh this topic of uh

972
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,360
resiliency on other industries again i'm

973
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,640
sorry for beating at that horse right

974
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
but uh

975
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,840
when you look at a plane you would

976
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,039
expect it to fly on a reduced uh like

977
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,279
number of targets that are working or

978
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,440
when you look at a ship like the titanic

979
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
in theory was

980
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,480
expected to be flooded to a certain

981
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
percentage and things would still work

982
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,679
out they would still be able to make it

983
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,879
to shore

984
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,000
uh

985
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
i think there's also a uh

986
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,918
a lack of uh

987
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,800
recognition that uh we need to employ

988
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
these uh these mechanisms because again

989
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
we're still critical infrastructure even

990
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,760
though we're

991
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
uh information uh

992
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,839
information systems or like on the

993
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,879
information economy um these things have

994
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,879
a fundamental impact on everybody's uh

995
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,560
well-being and we need to start

996
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
budgeting

997
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,320
or disaster strategies accordingly

998
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,320
thank you so much

999
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
department yeah i mean

1000
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
everybody raised uh everybody pointed

1001
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
out the backdrops basically the

1002
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,320
resiliency i agree with that

1003
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,280
i mean the fact that uh the critical

1004
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,440
infrastructure is not backed up that's

1005
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,599
kind of points out that our main the

1006
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,359
initial question like

1007
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,240
the

1008
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,160
organizations are missing the very basic

1009
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,640
thing that they should follow

1010
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,200
and uh other thing

1011
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,599
i don't know like i want to ask everyone

1012
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,480
here

1013
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
so like moving the infrastructure to

1014
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,520
cloud does that provide us with the

1015
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,359
automated backup mechanism so that we

1016
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,119
don't need to worry about backup if we

1017
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,680
put if we deploy all our infrastructure

1018
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,960
as micro services on amazon like now

1019
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,560
can we be

1020
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
free of this backup

1021
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
business can we be

1022
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
safe about or like can we not worry

1023
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
about ransomware anywhere anytime like

1024
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,079
what do you guys think about that

1025
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,000
is cloud the way to go

1026
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,440
to avoid having these backups

1027
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
i think you still need

1028
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,640
go ahead just this way i was going to

1029
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,760
say the criminals typically have

1030
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
administrative rights so they just log

1031
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
into your cloud and delete everything

1032
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,920
um

1033
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,240
so that isn't necessarily great either

1034
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,160
right this is why backups are

1035
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,359
actually a problem a lot of

1036
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,720
organizations have backups and they're

1037
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,280
using things like uh veeam or other

1038
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,720
commercial backup solutions and then

1039
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
they use amazon s3 as the back end or

1040
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
backblaze or azure in order to store

1041
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,720
their backups the problem is those are

1042
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
online backups and if the criminal has

1043
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
administrative rights they just go

1044
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,119
delete them right and so people that

1045
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,599
did i.t when i was coming up in it

1046
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,440
back in the 90s and i had to like haul

1047
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
the tapes home every night so that they

1048
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
would be off-site from the office when

1049
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
we were done doing tape backups turns

1050
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,800
out that'd be great right now

1051
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
because if those if those backups are

1052
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,680
offline

1053
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,040
then they can't be deleted by the

1054
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
criminal but the problem is most

1055
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
organizations are either backing up to

1056
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
live hard disks that are hooked to the

1057
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,359
sand

1058
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,960
or they're backing up to a cloud

1059
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,560
provider and those online backups are

1060
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
simply wiped out by the crooks

1061
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
the benefit though a cloud i think is

1062
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
it's moved more organizations towards a

1063
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,599
zero trust approach which we talked a

1064
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,440
little bit in the fireside chat with

1065
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
staff earlier

1066
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,079
and

1067
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,920
we all have known for a long time that

1068
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
zero trust concept is the way forward

1069
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
but i think the adoption of it's being

1070
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
driven by the cloud now as soon as you

1071
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,920
move your authentication into azure

1072
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760
active directory and as soon as you move

1073
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
your email into gmail and you start

1074
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,160
moving your crm into salesforce the idea

1075
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,079
of these isolated systems having their

1076
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,599
own authentication and protection and

1077
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,119
authorization rules

1078
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,720
just kicks in automatically right rather

1079
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
than i logged into the network now i get

1080
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,640
everything which is our old model right

1081
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,720
so there are huge advantages i think

1082
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
conceptually moving to the cloud that

1083
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,680
provides a bit of a higher level of

1084
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
security consciousness and modern

1085
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,520
security but it doesn't necessarily help

1086
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,680
with the backup problem

1087
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,160
i i agree very strongly with a off-site

1088
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,680
backup i think other than being an

1089
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,359
operational nightmare this would be

1090
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,040
perhaps the best thing that you can do

1091
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
to protect your uh

1092
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,119
yourself from ransomware

1093
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,839
uh i also wonder the use of uh

1094
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,160
stuff like the diodes and like

1095
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
right on the backups could also help

1096
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,680
uh but i overall i

1097
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,960
i don't know if i'm just old school but

1098
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,720
i think uh off-site backups that you can

1099
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,560
physically control are just the best

1100
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,960
thing you can do

1101
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,800
i think uh there's a

1102
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
it's an interesting really interesting

1103
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
question because one could make a strong

1104
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,280
case that

1105
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,839
traversal from local admin rights on an

1106
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,400
infected window machine to getting the

1107
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
cloud credentials to actually modify the

1108
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,560
backup strategy is a

1109
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,119
is a big jump and there are many

1110
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,839
opportunities to stop that jump

1111
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,560
uh it's not going to be an obvious easy

1112
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,400
jump in many cases

1113
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,119
so

1114
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,079
you may

1115
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,640
get a window of protection

1116
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,079
i think if everyone was doing that the

1117
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,680
criminals would as chester says the

1118
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,079
judge adjust their behavior to watch for

1119
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,800
it

1120
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
so the moment there's the the criminals

1121
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,079
can be very successful without being too

1122
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,240
sophisticated so there's an opportunity

1123
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,119
for

1124
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,720
being you know as i always say not the

1125
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,359
slowest rabbit being a little faster

1126
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,520
and avoiding the commodity attack

1127
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,720
strategy

1128
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,880
if you are big and important and you're

1129
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,280
suffering you're facing a dedicated

1130
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
hacker

1131
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,079
they'll do the reconnaissance to work

1132
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,800
their way through and mitigate that

1133
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,560
well all it takes uh the ones that are

1134
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,000
falling victims simon are the ones that

1135
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,359
are integrating active directory as

1136
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,040
their authentication right so their

1137
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,240
backup solution in the cloud once

1138
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
they've got the domain amazon these guys

1139
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
aren't sophisticated enough to go

1140
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,760
separately find your amazon credentials

1141
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
they're just logging in with regular

1142
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
windows credentials that before their

1143
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,480
own convenience i t departments have

1144
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
like made windows authentication on all

1145
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,480
of their things including their backups

1146
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
so

1147
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,119
multi-factor would stop it every single

1148
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,640
time yeah but nobody's using

1149
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
multi-factor so like these are super

1150
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
simple solutions like do the basics turn

1151
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
multi-factor on don't integrate active

1152
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
directory into your super admin rights

1153
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
in the cloud

1154
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,079
um all of those any one of those things

1155
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,200
is enough to stop any of this from

1156
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,880
happening

1157
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
well thank you so much uh for the

1158
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,240
response

1159
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,040
yes we always forget our basics you know

1160
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,880
we always work our basic we always make

1161
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,319
advancement in the technology

1162
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,079
infrastructure but sometimes we are

1163
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,880
forgetting the basic and one thing is

1164
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,680
and no system is 100 secure so that's

1165
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,640
why we need to implement some kind of

1166
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,599
defense mechanism so any time or attack

1167
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,400
happens we have a we have a plan

1168
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,000
as many panelists said we need to have a

1169
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
good plan backup so one is the backup it

1170
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,119
has to be not on site has to be offside

1171
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,000
so another recovery plan we need to also

1172
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
focus on critical infrastructure

1173
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
um that's uh

1174
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,160
let's move to another question

1175
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,440
another question is in your opinion what

1176
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,680
is the most important lesson learned

1177
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,079
from the recent high profile ransomware

1178
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
attack

1179
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,800
anybody wants to

1180
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,520
take this one

1181
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,040
i would say paying doesn't guarantee

1182
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,520
recovery

1183
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
several attacks i've seen lately people

1184
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,119
paid nothing worked

1185
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,079
yes

1186
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,440
uh

1187
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
the the the um i have data on that eight

1188
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,599
percent of victims get all of their data

1189
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,640
back

1190
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,119
the average victim gets 66 of their data

1191
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,160
back

1192
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,119
and 33 percent of victims get less than

1193
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,560
half their data back

1194
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,640
so um but 98 get some data back so only

1195
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
two percent get nothing

1196
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,000
um but the the criminals decryption

1197
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,560
tools are buggy like so if you do

1198
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
i don't encourage anybody to pay the

1199
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
ransom but if you pay the ransom come to

1200
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,520
one of us vendors

1201
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
will write a decryption tool that will

1202
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
work with their keys whereas the one

1203
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
they provide you may not

1204
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
and in the case of colonial apparently

1205
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,839
the restoral tool after they paid the

1206
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,359
ransom was slower than restoring their

1207
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,800
backups

1208
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,319
and so it kind of didn't do them any

1209
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,160
good but but minor stuff we don't

1210
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,760
personally do this at sophos but some of

1211
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,440
the vendors in our space will write you

1212
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,839
a custom decrypt tool that uses the keys

1213
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,359
that they gave you and it's much more

1214
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,040
likely to be like multi-threaded and

1215
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,880
fast and

1216
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,480
this kind of stuff the criminals do not

1217
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,119
their qa is not good and at best their

1218
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
qa is only focused on the encryption not

1219
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,119
the decryption

1220
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,960
and also like you know if you yeah i'm

1221
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,280
also like if you really pay them ransom

1222
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
you know how sure that they will not

1223
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
come back to you you know because they

1224
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
already got all the information there so

1225
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
that's another

1226
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,960
uh important thing that they have to

1227
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,880
remember that paying rent somewhere it

1228
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
might not help them for the long term

1229
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
usually it's a different ransom group

1230
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,760
that comes back the second time i mean

1231
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
when it does happen i mean there is a

1232
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,520
weird reputational situation with the

1233
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,040
criminals which is

1234
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,880
they know that if word gets around that

1235
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
they say they're going to do something

1236
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
and they don't then nobody's ever going

1237
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
to pay them ransom again so there's this

1238
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
weird kind of mafia

1239
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,200
code of

1240
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,240
honor i guess but um

1241
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,920
we've seen at least two or three victims

1242
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,200
hit twice but it was always two

1243
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,839
different groups

1244
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,720
yes

1245
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,850
thank you stopped by the same criminals

1246
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,640
[Music]

1247
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,760
well it could be yeah because i mean

1248
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
they're all affiliate based right so the

1249
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
idea is the you know the affiliates move

1250
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
around between different ransomware

1251
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,960
networks if you want to call them yes

1252
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,839
nope

1253
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,319
i agree with chester we we see

1254
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,880
terms and conditions of of getting the

1255
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
key like the criminals will say you know

1256
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,720
we would not attack you again or for

1257
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,960
this much time and we guarantee this

1258
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,240
than the other

1259
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,720
but it's uh yeah as you say as chester

1260
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,240
says it's an affiliate group one group

1261
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,079
has done the reconnaissance sold the

1262
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,520
data to some other group who've

1263
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
weaponized it penetrated you

1264
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,839
there's there's no guarantee that they

1265
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,079
won't come back and kill you again

1266
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,599
and because they give us sanctions and

1267
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,240
things they keep changing names yeah so

1268
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,680
one you know one week they're dark

1269
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,119
matter and the next week they're black

1270
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,319
matter and the week after that there's

1271
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,760
something else so

1272
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,119
you know they're trying to i hope

1273
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,640
they're not dark matter that's a real

1274
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,680
company oh sorry well

1275
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,160
i'm using the wrong my apologies to dark

1276
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,160
matter

1277
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
okay

1278
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
well i i think a common pattern here is

1279
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,160
that most of them are uh uninteresting

1280
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,839
uh there's a there's a talk about alex

1281
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,280
daniels on using security in 2019

1282
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,760
uh but for as much as we want the

1283
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,079
hacking to be like hollywood that's like

1284
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,400
so much like breaking into the pentagon

1285
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,480
they're just finding a paste bin with

1286
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,079
your password

1287
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,880
using some like very badly written

1288
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
set script to

1289
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
parse through large amounts of data and

1290
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,640
then they start stuffing it into a bunch

1291
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
of places they realize that you have

1292
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,079
horrible password practices

1293
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,720
and they they they go from there uh

1294
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,400
which is it's what makes it very very

1295
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
frustrating in that

1296
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,400
for as much research that we can have

1297
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
and identifying new ways to detect all

1298
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:38,960
of this

1299
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,560
uh

1300
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
we have been seeing this happening over

1301
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,200
and over again on the like most

1302
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,200
basic common denominator like password

1303
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,440
stuffing phishing

1304
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,520
a malicious powerpoint file about

1305
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,640
puppies

1306
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,119
stuff like that

1307
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,440
and uh yeah i think that's why it also

1308
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,599
calls for like maybe a stepping back on

1309
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,319
and rethinking things

1310
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
i mean most roads end in multi-factor

1311
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,960
multi-factor would thwart 99 of these

1312
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,079
attacks

1313
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,200
like i'd love to sell you some

1314
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,640
anti-ransomware stuff but you'd be

1315
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,160
better off implementing multi-factor

1316
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,200
like just flat across the board

1317
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,119
it helps with not only ransomware right

1318
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,640
it helps with the launch yeah i mean

1319
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,960
it's just and it just the end result is

1320
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
these criminals need administrative

1321
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,000
rights to do what they're doing

1322
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,440
they can't turn off the anti-virus if

1323
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,520
they don't have admin they can't steal

1324
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,880
the most important files that are locked

1325
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,560
up in the file share for finance if they

1326
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,720
don't have admin like if you simply put

1327
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,480
mfa on your admin this all stops

1328
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,480
so and like

1329
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
what is the

1330
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
barrier to

1331
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
like deploy multi-factor authentication

1332
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,079
in organizations like why are they not

1333
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,480
doing it

1334
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,880
i forgot my keys at work and i don't

1335
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,000
want to have to go back and get them i

1336
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,319
don't know

1337
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,960
it's

1338
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,119
it's interesting to see like although

1339
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,200
we know the solution is simple like the

1340
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,280
organizations don't try to enforce this

1341
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,920
right uh well i think it's as similar as

1342
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,599
a backup question right it's just an

1343
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,440
operational uh

1344
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,599
add-on and a lot of this time you're

1345
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,760
really running on a tight budget

1346
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,839
and you don't have

1347
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
the time to be asking people to do these

1348
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,480
things and sometimes it just

1349
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
it's just it's just looked at as a

1350
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,079
something that's

1351
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,680
restricting you from doing your work

1352
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,200
rather than

1353
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,359
part and parcel of doing your work

1354
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,520
um

1355
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,280
i think in a sense uh all of this like

1356
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
challenges almost stop being uh

1357
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,880
technical and start being a little bit

1358
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,560
more of the regulatory

1359
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,160
side and the

1360
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,079
cultural development side of things and

1361
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,000
uh if you want it to be technical maybe

1362
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,480
it's on the hdi side of things right

1363
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,960
uh i have my developers in my lab now i

1364
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
have a uv key

1365
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,880
and now i said like take this thing

1366
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,119
follow this like five step guy i don't

1367
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
want you to commit to the repo until you

1368
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,079
do that

1369
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,880
uh and that does change things a lot uh

1370
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,480
compared to like say oh download this

1371
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,040
phone app and scan this qr code

1372
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
and then you change your phone and

1373
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,280
whatever and it's just like a a

1374
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,720
different level on the of the

1375
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,240
conversation i think

1376
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,280
okay

1377
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,680
well thank you so much i do have more

1378
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,880
questions but the time is 347

1379
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
we need to open the floor and to

1380
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,480
to get the question from audience if

1381
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,760
they don't have any question then we'll

1382
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,480
continue with the question that i have

1383
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
so now we are opening the floor to the

1384
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,480
tour audience folks in the audience

1385
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,960
please share your questions and comments

1386
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,800
with the panel via the chat function

1387
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
here for questions we're using the q a

1388
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,839
section and there is a question in there

1389
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,240
okay

1390
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,280
so should i start with that one the

1391
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,359
disclosure question so the question is

1392
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,559
about

1393
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,880
perfect go ahead simon

1394
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,720
question to ask about the uh the

1395
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,480
thoughts on disclosure where we call it

1396
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,359
where criminal takes your data encrypts

1397
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,280
your copy of it and then threatens to

1398
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,960
share their copy with the rest of the

1399
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
world so blackmail again

1400
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,000
um

1401
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,400
yeah hideous evil

1402
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,440
uh

1403
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,720
not something

1404
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,559
socially acceptable

1405
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,240
but i come back to my position statement

1406
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,440
is i don't think you should be able to

1407
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
buy your way out of problems

1408
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,280
like if it's happened

1409
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
it's happened your data is already owned

1410
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,880
by criminals there's no guarantee they

1411
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,960
will delete it it will exist on the dark

1412
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,040
word for eternity

1413
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,079
i think paying is just

1414
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,480
paying isn't i i keep saying it's not as

1415
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,160
socially and not it doesn't seem to be

1416
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,200
an ethical choice for me

1417
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,839
uh i will comment on it as well with

1418
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,079
that uh they almost all the groups do

1419
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,520
this now they're they're going to post

1420
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,359
the data largely and i agree with simon

1421
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,119
on the paying

1422
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,280
but the uh

1423
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,640
we had one victim that turned it to

1424
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,839
their advantage which is they couldn't

1425
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,119
afford to pay

1426
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,319
and they waited for the criminals to

1427
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,680
publish their data on the dark web so

1428
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,440
they could download it and get their

1429
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,760
data back so at least that worked out

1430
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,240
for that particular victim um

1431
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,000
i mean if you're a law abiding you have

1432
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,599
to disclose

1433
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,880
that this attack happened even if the

1434
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,640
criminals don't publish it

1435
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,520
so

1436
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,720
you're not really saving yourself

1437
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,599
anything and and by the numbers again

1438
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,599
ransom is typically only one-tenth of

1439
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,960
your cost of recovery whether you pay

1440
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,400
the ransom or not so the average

1441
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
recovery in the us is 1.8 million

1442
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,480
dollars per event the average ransom in

1443
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,000
the us is 175 000 per event so

1444
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
it turns out the extra 1.7 million uh or

1445
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,800
1.6 million that it costs

1446
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,319
exists whether you pay the ransom or not

1447
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,200
because

1448
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,960
simon could sing say you burn down the

1449
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
building that's what you have to do

1450
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,760
anyway the criminals have compromised

1451
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,359
your network you have to burn it all

1452
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,960
down and build it all over again no

1453
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
matter whether you pay the ransom or not

1454
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,640
so all you're really doing is funding

1455
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,839
criminal activity when you're paying the

1456
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,800
ransom is assuming you have backups and

1457
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,240
i'll never blame a victim for what they

1458
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,520
choose to do but if we keep paying the

1459
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,680
ransom this is never going to end

1460
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,400
i would i would be very proud to do

1461
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,480
business with a company who said we got

1462
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,000
hit by ransomware and we refuse to pay

1463
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,040
uh this is disruptive please bear with

1464
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,760
us

1465
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,280
like a company that took the high moral

1466
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
ground and said we are not participating

1467
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
in this in this

1468
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,599
i would be i would consider them highly

1469
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,319
worthy of my business i really would

1470
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,960
um and i and i would hope as a community

1471
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,200
we applaud people who

1472
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,319
stand up and and act ethically

1473
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,119
and we support them through transitions

1474
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,400
you know it's

1475
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,079
it's we shouldn't be condemning people

1476
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,319
but making good choices even if they

1477
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,880
made poor risk decisions that got them

1478
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,079
uh hit in the first place

1479
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,839
i agree with you uh we should never pay

1480
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,359
ransom to

1481
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,200
any criminals you know because they will

1482
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
like other activities other criminal

1483
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,440
activities i agree with you

1484
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,280
uh we have the second question here

1485
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,359
anybody would like to take the second

1486
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,720
question

1487
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,078
that's pretty interesting question

1488
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
i can explain why i think we don't know

1489
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,040
which is the past problems as we

1490
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,040
discussed earlier in the conversation

1491
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
were around collecting money

1492
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,880
and so we kept playing whack-a-mole

1493
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,400
moving them around from one scam to the

1494
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,839
next scam to the next scam to the next

1495
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,119
scam because they had to keep finding

1496
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,880
new ways of collecting money after

1497
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,240
credit cards were cut off they used

1498
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,000
these green dot money pack cards you buy

1499
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
711 or walgreens and

1500
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,440
and then you know once they started

1501
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,800
putting warning on things then they

1502
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,160
started doing western union and then

1503
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
western union started patrolling their

1504
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,559
wire transfers better and like we were

1505
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,839
chasing them around and they kept going

1506
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,119
next game i don't think there is a next

1507
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,559
scam after ransomware as long as we have

1508
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,000
cryptocurrency to

1509
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
and as long as people keep paying it

1510
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,359
there's there's just no reason for this

1511
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,880
to end and this is the longest trend

1512
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,400
i've ever seen in my career i mean i've

1513
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,680
been working in security since the mid

1514
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,880
90s

1515
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,760
and

1516
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,520
it's always changed every 18 months

1517
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,760
based on okay we fixed this thing now

1518
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,200
what's the next thing right like we

1519
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,040
started using firewalls so worms kind of

1520
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,480
died off so we started attacking

1521
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,640
browsers so we killed java plug-in and

1522
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,160
flash plug-in and then stopped attacking

1523
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,000
browsers right we keep getting better we

1524
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,839
are getting better right we're like 90

1525
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,680
or more encrypted websites now like all

1526
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,440
the work we're doing truly matters and

1527
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,960
has made the world considerably more

1528
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
secure but this is an achilles heel as

1529
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,040
long as this cryptocurrency problem

1530
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,960
exists this problem isn't going to

1531
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,480
change

1532
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,440
yesterday

1533
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,520
where do you stand on the destruction

1534
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,200
where we're seeing where criminals are

1535
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,040
threatening to permanently break

1536
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,240
hardware using your eu efi and firmware

1537
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,359
attacks

1538
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,119
so the threat isn't just disclosure of

1539
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,119
data or ransom it's like if you don't

1540
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,880
pay i'm going to destroy your

1541
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,760
irrecoverable irrecoverably destroy your

1542
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
i.t infrastructure

1543
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,680
we haven't seen anyone do it so as far

1544
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,760
as i'm aware it's a toothless threat at

1545
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,839
the moment but there's obviously nothing

1546
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,480
stopping them per se

1547
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,480
you know there are security mechanisms

1548
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,640
around updating yuffie firmware from

1549
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,640
within the guest operating system of the

1550
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,559
computer however we also have seen dell

1551
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,200
lenovo and others have massive flaws in

1552
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,400
their

1553
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,319
bios update code that have been

1554
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,800
disclosed in the last 12 months that

1555
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
the right criminal with the right

1556
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,240
technical skill there's nothing stopping

1557
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,640
them right

1558
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,559
and it's really hard to defend against

1559
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,040
like software like can that can detect

1560
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
ransomware and stuff i'm not sure could

1561
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,000
be uh effective at protecting firmware

1562
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,319
in that capacity if it's a vulnerable

1563
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,359
if it's a vulnerability in the the oem's

1564
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,599
you know system

1565
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,000
so i i will say that

1566
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,559
from an academic standpoint i think uh

1567
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,040
ransomware is not

1568
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,880
going to end because it's it's almost

1569
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,520
like it means to an end uh

1570
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,359
rather than a particular like attack

1571
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,319
vector or why to infiltrate the network

1572
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,680
something that i

1573
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,200
that we're seeing a trend and i think it

1574
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,520
should be uh brought up more

1575
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,280
like uh prominently is that software

1576
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,960
supply chain attacks are also on the

1577
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,640
rise and uh we're starting to see

1578
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,079
combinations of these where people

1579
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,599
actually attack the software delivery

1580
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,720
pipeline

1581
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,559
to hack a consumer that was the case of

1582
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,960
solving wins i wouldn't be surprised we

1583
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,960
start seeing essentially these two ideas

1584
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,880
come together in which somebody

1585
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,119
hacks solarwinds to essentially make a

1586
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,079
ransomware over the the fda or the cdc

1587
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,520
or something like that

1588
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,280
and this would be extremely devastating

1589
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,880
because they can actually get into more

1590
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,800
high profile targets that

1591
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,280
may have uh proper uh

1592
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,960
proper mechanisms in place to protect

1593
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,440
against the old school uh i sent an

1594
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,920
email uh with a with a fishing link on

1595
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,799
it

1596
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,319
well that was kind of the cassaya attack

1597
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,079
right i mean cassaya the vulnerability

1598
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,079
in kasaya led to pretty much all of the

1599
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,400
downstream victims getting implanted

1600
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,160
despite them not necessarily even have

1601
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,839
done anything wrong

1602
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,280
um

1603
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,720
that's a that's a super tough one

1604
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,480
software supply chain is incredibly weak

1605
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
we have another

1606
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,400
kind of follow-up question or more

1607
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,960
clarification so question is do you have

1608
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,799
any specific best practice

1609
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,359
recommendation for making your data less

1610
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,200
valuable to bad guys with threatened

1611
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,040
disclosure mean the person disclosure

1612
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,240
that asked the question also was saying

1613
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,280
about you know encryption of their

1614
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,200
databases obviously encryption is great

1615
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,680
if you can implement it successfully

1616
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
um the problem is the criminals likely

1617
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,200
will have the keys

1618
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,520
if they've gotten administrative rights

1619
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,280
again so it's really about stopping them

1620
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
from getting

1621
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,760
control of everything at the top

1622
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,000
the the other thing to keep in mind is a

1623
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,440
lot of things are

1624
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,839
difficult to encrypt that are still good

1625
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,640
extortion tools like your email um they

1626
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,079
are reading your email

1627
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,599
i mean i didn't mention this in any of

1628
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,040
the earlier stuff but just as a tip to

1629
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
anyone if they are victimized by these

1630
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,400
guys they're watching all your

1631
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,079
communication so you have to go out of

1632
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,520
band and have a plan to go out of band

1633
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,799
they're reading your emails so if you're

1634
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,799
negotiate if you're talking about

1635
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,799
snuffing them and not paying the ransom

1636
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,720
in email they're reading your email

1637
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,559
they're just going to nuke your stuff

1638
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,720
um you need to be talking on the phone

1639
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,480
or over text messages or whatsapp or you

1640
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,000
gotta have some kind of plan

1641
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,319
to talk out of band with your service

1642
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,559
providers with your co-workers

1643
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,799
because once you're compromised they're

1644
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,400
going to use your own communications

1645
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,839
against you and so to alex's question i

1646
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:26,720
mean

1647
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,480
my concern would be even if you encrypt

1648
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,480
files and databases and things

1649
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,960
email is always somewhat open access to

1650
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,480
employees and almost needs to be for the

1651
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,640
way we all communicate today so they

1652
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,160
will try to use that against you as well

1653
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,079
so perhaps telling your employees not to

1654
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,760
use email for

1655
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,839
illegal activity and password sharing

1656
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,280
and

1657
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,559
talking about how they're discriminating

1658
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,680
against someone or something would be a

1659
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,240
great idea

1660
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,720
uh i think

1661
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,720
to after that i forget what the example

1662
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,920
was but uh

1663
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,280
i remember there was a

1664
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,799
high-profile ransomware attack i think

1665
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,119
last year that they

1666
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,319
the hankers realized that the

1667
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,920
information of them being hacked was

1668
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,880
enough for them to like speculate on the

1669
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,040
unlike uh on the stocks of that company

1670
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,079
itself

1671
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,119
so

1672
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,280
they they are very very clever and they

1673
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,480
they're really just trying to figure out

1674
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,160
what they can make what they got uh

1675
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,200
so

1676
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
i it is hard to have smart people that

1677
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,559
are just trying to make this their

1678
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:23,760
living

1679
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,839
with just like a random afterthought

1680
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,839
i guess the the challenge is they have

1681
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,680
more experience at this than you right

1682
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,119
you're not their first victim and

1683
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,480
they've been through this a few times

1684
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,760
and they know they know what the

1685
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,280
insurance company negotiator is going to

1686
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,079
say

1687
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,119
they know what you're going to do to

1688
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,720
stall to buy time to decide whether

1689
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,000
you're going to pay the ransom they know

1690
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,760
the the tells

1691
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,960
of somebody who's going to pay and

1692
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,119
somebody who isn't um and

1693
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,799
and that's unfortunate for the victims

1694
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,359
which is why i think having an outside

1695
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,359
firm of some sort help you in these

1696
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,799
types of incidents is essential because

1697
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,240
they also have experience working with

1698
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,440
these criminals

1699
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,760
and that does give you at least some

1700
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
even playing ground while you figure out

1701
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,400
how to save your business

1702
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,240
and that sounds like a wonderful spot to

1703
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,880
wrap up this panel discussion

1704
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,240
