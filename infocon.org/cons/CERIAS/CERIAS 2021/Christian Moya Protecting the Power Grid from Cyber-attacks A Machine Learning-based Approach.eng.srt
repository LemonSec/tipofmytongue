6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
department christian good afternoon the

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400
floor is yours

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,919
hi everyone let me share my screen

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
are you seeing my screen

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
looks good christian okay awesome so

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
uh hi my name is christian muya um i'm a

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,399
postdoctoral researcher at the

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,920
department of mathematics at purdue

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,280
university

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
today i'm going to present some of our

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
research

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
about

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
machine learning based methods that we

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
are trying to use to protect the power

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
grid from cyber attacks

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,039
so

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,359
the power grid is a very large a very

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
non-linear very complex and only a

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
system that has seen a lot of deployment

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
of information and communication

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
technology

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
which has created more interconnection

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
with an interconnection between the i.t

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
network uh the control network the scan

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
network for example and the autonomous

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
or the physical system and this

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
transforms the power grid into cyber

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
physical system

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
the which is ambition to improve the

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,840
reliability and operation of the grid

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,159
however it also increases the risk of

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
cyber attacks especially cyber attacks

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,920
that aim to

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
create some energy delivery disruption

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
moreover and as the grid becomes more

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
interconnected and operates in a more

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
distributed fashion

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
uh the attack surface the number of the

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
the number of components that an

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,600
adversary can attack is increasing this

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,759
attack surface is widening so the risk

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
is even even more

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
as the grid progresses to a more

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
distributed operation

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,119
and cyber attacks are not theoretical as

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,399
we know from the attack against the

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
ukrainian power grid

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
here

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
the adversaries

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,720
reach the distributed management system

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
from the itt network they use phishing

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,360
emails they use lateral

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
movements until they reach their target

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
which was the scala system they took

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
control of the scada they opened some

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
breakers and

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,720
they created outages that affected more

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
than 200 000 customers

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
if something like this will happen in

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
the us

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
this will cost billions and it will

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
affect many of the critical

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
infrastructure

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
so

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
in our research our focus is on machine

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
learning and learning based solution for

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
dynamical systems and we're particularly

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,879
interested in power grids

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,640
we have developed prediction methods

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
uncertainty quantification

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
we're looking at control and decision

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
making and we know that we could use

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
most of them for like providing cyber

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,399
security solutions at the ot level

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,920
and in particular we are interested in

81
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
stopping coordinated control attacks the

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
attack against the ukrainian power

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
really was a coordinated control attack

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
by coordinated we mean the manipulation

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,800
of multiple power grid devices in order

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
to jeopardize the power grid operation

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,959
in the figure that you're seeing there

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,400
for example we are assuming the

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
adversary has reached

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
the scala system of generator owners and

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
transmission owners operators

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
and they are ready to either operate the

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,280
the

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
generators they're going to disrupt the

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
the power output of the generators or

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
they're going to open a transmission

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,319
line like what happened in the in the uk

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,280
uh this is not a new problem in fact the

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
power community has studied this problem

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
before

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
they for example have assumed that the

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
adversary could potentially operate many

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
generators or lots

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,280
and they use the steady state tools to

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
predict whether these this manipulation

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,959
this adversarial manipulation will reach

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
to a point where the power flows in the

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,760
system

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,319
uh where were are going to be higher

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
than the ratings and these will treat

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
them the protections

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
which could trigger also cascading

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
failure and blackouts

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
they usually use steady state approaches

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,000
so

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
in

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
in particular they use the what is known

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,759
as the power flow equation

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
another another

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
another topic that has been studied a

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
lot for example by abv is that what

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
happens when the adversary opens circuit

123
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
break is like what happened in the

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
ukrainian power grid is there a way we

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
can stop this

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
these usually create large disturbances

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
in the grid and these could potentially

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
be very catastrophic so

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
our goal in our in our research is

130
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
actually to predict whether uh the

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
consequences of these attacks

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
uh and uh and we assume that all these

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
adversaries uh their goal is to disrupt

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
the power grid operations so their goal

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
is in the physical space

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
even though they had to traverse over

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
the cyber space in order to reach this

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
goal

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,320
so we we have the level of several

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
methods

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
and how to stop these coordinated

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
attacks for example we we i'm not going

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
to show uh how we can screen this up the

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
adversarial command that comes with uh

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
that will operate the generators and uh

146
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,199
will move the power grid to a point

147
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
that's going to disrupt

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,479
and also uh and this is current this is

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
our current work uh we're trying to see

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
after an attack whether we can predict

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,080
what would be the consequence of the

152
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
attack very fast so we can create

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,400
emergency control control strategies

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
the first uh

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,479
so let me explain this example so

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
in this example we're assuming that that

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
the power grid is uh in without an

158
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
adversary the power grid the the

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
operator of the power bit is gonna

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
operate the generators in order to

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
follow the law

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
and

163
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
however in an adversarial environment

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
when the adversary has reached the scada

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
system the adversary could also operate

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
this we could also manipulate these

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
commands in order to disrupt the power

168
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,639
with operation

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
so the goal of the the difference in

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
this case is to create a method

171
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,520
a digital copy of the power grid that

172
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
will observe this command and we'll

173
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,199
predict whether this this is going to

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
create some disruption or not

175
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
right

176
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
so but this is a very challenging

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
problem because the power gate uh it

178
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,720
operates in an unstationary environment

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
and the decisions are not the same uh

180
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
depending on on the on the time of the

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,039
year right if the attack happens during

182
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,600
the summer with high load the adversary

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
may need only a few generators to

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
compromise in order to disrupt the power

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,000
grid but in low load conditions the

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
adversary the same attack may not affect

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
the power g the power grid is very

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
robust and we'll actually right through

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,319
that attack

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,360
so

191
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
in order to develop a method we need to

192
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
always have to

193
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
uh

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,599
have to be able to capture the operating

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,280
point the power grid is is currently in

196
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
so in our work we develop a variation

197
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,319
learning method uh that does exactly

198
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,400
this this essentially uh predicts

199
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
whether these commands this manipulation

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
of the generation will either or will

201
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,160
will disrupt or not the power grid and

202
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
it will disrupt we're going to stop it

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
we're going to stop that command and and

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
and

205
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,280
we're going to stop the command

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
but if if the if the command is safe or

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
it's not going to disrupt the power

208
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
we're going to allow it

209
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
we

210
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
we also attach as always some

211
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,919
uncertainty quantification to the

212
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,440
prediction because machine learning

213
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
methods especially they are usually um

214
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
they felt

215
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
a little bit in when they need to

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
generalize to outside of what their

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
training model training samples were

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,759
and using this uncertainty

219
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
quantification we can combine this model

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
with more complex methods in order to

221
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,039
increase uh

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,800
increase they are our prediction

223
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
capability and our performance to stop

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,919
cyber attacks

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
uh some results uh so essentially with

226
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
machine learning based methods what we

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
what we obtain is we are usually faster

228
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,240
in this case with a power with a very

229
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
large power grid of 3 000 buses

230
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
our method is 10 times

231
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,400
less

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,319
10 times faster than the

233
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
method that will use standard numerical

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
methods

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
and in terms of performance every node

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
method is a very simple linear

237
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
probabilistic model we also we almost

238
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
reach the same capacity the same

239
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
performance

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,399
of uh the model based method

241
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,679
now

242
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,679
uh what we've seen right now in what i

243
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
presented before was just

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
uh an application of uh when we when the

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
adversary underper small

246
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
creates a small perturbations uh of the

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
generation however we most likely the

248
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
adversaries will disrupt the power grid

249
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
by creating larger disturbances which

250
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,320
will

251
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
on the other hand create transient

252
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
responses

253
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
and we expect that these attacks are

254
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
gonna the goal of these attacks will be

255
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,279
to create large disturbances

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
so in in our current work what we have

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
done is a weird we develop a deep

258
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
learning based method that after an

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
attack observes a little bit of that

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
trajectory using pmu measurements

261
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
and then predicts

262
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
uh what would be the consequence of such

263
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
attack and this is done very fast

264
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
we will attach to this prediction

265
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
uncertainty quantification so we we will

266
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
essentially

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,839
provide a confidence interval whether

268
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
our our prediction is correct or not

269
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
and what this allows us and this is our

270
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
current work is that using these

271
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
predictions can we create emergency

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
controls such that the power grid will

273
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
right through this attack

274
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,839
this problem is extremely challenging

275
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
and in fact standard deep learning

276
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
methods uh they will fail with trying to

277
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
to predict try to do this kind of

278
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
extrapolation

279
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,640
so

280
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,279
what we do is we use a a method called

281
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
operator regression essentially we we

282
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
construct a map in between the

283
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
trajectories that have some information

284
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,320
about the attack uh this trajectory

285
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
two

286
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
uh to a trajectory that knows

287
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
a trajectory of what happens after the

288
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
attack

289
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,279
and in order to approximate this

290
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
operator we use what is called the

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
deponets this is a this is a different

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
kind of deep learning method that was uh

293
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
recently proposed by lulu in

294
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
natural intelligence

295
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
and this this deep learning method

296
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,959
contains two uh neural networks one

297
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,040
which is called branchnet the branch net

298
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,360
takes this input the the input with

299
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
information about the attack

300
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
and the throw net takes uh it takes uh

301
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,480
takes it takes an input something to

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
create a base basis function such as

303
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,839
such that we can decode the the post

304
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
attack trajectory these deponets have

305
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
shown very good generalization so

306
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,519
allowing this will allow us to do

307
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
extrapolation

308
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
they they perform very well when data is

309
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,600
scarce when it's expensive like in the

310
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
power grid

311
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
they allow to train with multifidelity

312
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
kind of data in this case we will we

313
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
will we will have data from the field

314
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
but also we can simulate uh attack data

315
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
to improve the the performance of

316
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
our deep learning method

317
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
and this is essentially a supervised

318
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
method even though we're trying to

319
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
create self-supervised approaches using

320
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
deployment

321
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
uh we also as

322
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
as mentioned before we we attached

323
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
uncertainty quantification to this

324
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
problem

325
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
uh to this end what we do is we we

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
create an architecture of our deep

327
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,160
learning method that not only predicts

328
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
uh cr

329
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,480
pro outputs our mean prediction but also

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
outputs a confidence value right in

331
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
terms of a standard deviation

332
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
and we achieve this by using a training

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,399
function

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
that will that will essentially

335
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
try to always approximate with

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
approximate the right trajectory using

337
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,720
the mean prediction but it also controls

338
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
our error using the standard language

339
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
our results are quite remarkable um

340
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,519
we

341
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
for example this is a result that we

342
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
tested on a 68 bus system

343
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
this is a response in one of the

344
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,000
generators and we created a cyber attack

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,839
in five of the transmission lines of the

346
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
68 bus system

347
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,000
and by observing just the first two

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
seconds of the response after the attack

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,880
we can predict the red the the red

350
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
dashed line is the prediction is the

351
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
mean prediction but also we provide an

352
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
uncertainty quantification uh value

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
estimate to this prediction

354
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
as you can see our our prediction

355
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
follows very well the true the true

356
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
value which is the blue line

357
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
and the blue line actually is within the

358
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
estimate of confidence which is what we

359
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
want right because whenever we do

360
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
controls we want to have the estimate in

361
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,800
order to uh to to try to

362
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
try to control the attack

363
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,079
uh and

364
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
this is just an example pictorial

365
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
example of what we have done we perform

366
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
at perform we develop tests on 300

367
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
trajectories

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,279
and we show that our mean predictions

369
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
are very good less than one percent

370
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
error relative error with respect to the

371
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
to the standard ones but the best the

372
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,240
best thing is that they the

373
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
the confidence interval this green

374
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
interval here contains 97 of the true

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,680
trajectory in those in most in almost

376
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,480
all our examples and this allows us to

377
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
conclude that our uncertainty

378
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,839
quantification can provide enough

379
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
information to create emergency control

380
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,199
and drive through attacks

381
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,000
in summary i have explained it a little

382
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
bit about the type of attacks we're

383
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
studying we're trying to defend against

384
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,639
which are coordinated attacks

385
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,519
uh we we describe evaluation variation

386
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
learning method to stop attacks when

387
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,360
disrupting just steady state operation

388
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
of the power grid

389
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
we also propose a probabilistic devoper

390
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
operator regression model to predict the

391
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
transient response during attacks that

392
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
are going to create large disturbances

393
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
and we use the opponents to approximate

394
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
this this operator

395
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
in our future work we're gonna design uh

396
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
emergency control using our predictive

397
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
trajectories

398
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,839
uh we're looking at using the physics of

399
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,279
the power system to improve our

400
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
generalization and create what is called

401
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
the physics-informed depo operator

402
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,560
neural networks

403
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,480
and you by using also a way to to

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
to using um solutions for inverse

405
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
problems plus the physics informative

406
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
operator operator neural networks we're

407
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
going to construct the digital chain of

408
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,839
a larger scale

409
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
of our large-scale power grid system

410
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,600
and

411
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
in in the future using this digital

412
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
thing we could stop these largest large

413
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,079
disturbance attacks even before they

414
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,600
happen

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
uh any questions wonderful thank you

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
very much christian appreciate your
