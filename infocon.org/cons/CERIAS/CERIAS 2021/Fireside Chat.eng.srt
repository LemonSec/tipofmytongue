1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
welcome back to the 22nd annual syria

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,880
security symposium the next on our

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
agenda is our annual fireside chat this

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
is usually rated as one of our highest

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,960
uh components of the of the symposium

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,120
every every year and i suspect this year

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
will be no different it is a free-form

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
conversation that will be moderated by

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
professor gene spafford the founder of

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,480
sirius and

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,119
executive director emeritus uh professor

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
spafford i turn it over to you to

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
introduce our fireside chatters

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,159
well thank you

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
uh hopefully we'll have quite a bit of

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
chatter here

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
let me uh

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
invite the audience to pose any

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
questions you might like us to consider

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
to the q a

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
in zoom and i'll go through those and

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
pick out some that seem to fit the flow

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
of the conversation

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,600
and having that conversation

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
uh we have three very distinguished

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
individuals a lot of experience in the

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,559
field you can read their bios online but

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,600
briefly we have simon hunt who is a vice

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
president at mastercard for cyber

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,439
innovation

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,400
amit duran who is the chairman and ceo

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
of a tenable corporation

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
and chet wisniewski who is a principal

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
scientist with sofos

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
these three gentlemen have considerable

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
background in a number of areas of

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,840
security and it should provide an

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
interesting conversation

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,600
um

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
one of the things i'd like to get

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
started with is

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
looking at some things that have been in

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,840
the news recently

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,400
and

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
ransomware obviously has been in the

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
news

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
i'm going to

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
bypass that because i know that's going

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,960
to be

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,799
the main topic of a panel that two of

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
you are on later today

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
but another news item is that there

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
seems to be growing momentum in

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
washington

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,119
for mandatory reporting of cyber

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,719
security incidents

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,200
and this is something that not

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
everyone in industry is

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
completely happy with

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
because of the burden involved and

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,680
possibly interference with some of their

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
internal investigations

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
uh but i would be interested in hearing

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
uh the three of you make some comment on

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
that and let me start with a meet uh

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
because you have background in both

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
government and uh industry well what

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,119
what do you have to say about this

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,360
i can't hear you

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
please unmute yourself every zoom has to

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
at least have uh

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
have a please unmute yourself so now

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
that we've got that out of the way uh

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
it's great to be here uh with you today

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
and and great to join this uh this

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
terrific panel

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
uh i'm i

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
i'm a huge fan of mandatory reporting i

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,959
think it's

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
you know lack of transparency lack of

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
data lack of understanding have been a a

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
key

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
failure in the cyber security market

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
over the last 30 you know plus years

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
uh in order for

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
free markets to work and i think you

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
know generally speaking we all we all

88
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
believe that that's

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
a more efficient model or a most

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,879
efficient model

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
you have to have certain characteristics

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
you have to understand risks you have to

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
understand the threat environment you

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
have to understand

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
uh losses accurately you have to and and

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
and so having greater transparency part

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
of which is

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
mandatory breach reporting and not just

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
about silly pii i mean pii is important

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
but that's a small subset of the

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,760
breaches that that we see

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
mandatory

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,519
reporting of breaches

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,840
increases the level of transparency it

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,239
will help the market understand

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
when breaches occur the volume of

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
breaches which are occurring the

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
consequences of breaches occurring and

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,879
also start understanding which

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,120
organizations are investing in and

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
taking cyber security seriously which

112
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
organizations are not doing that and

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
you'll see trends starting to emerge

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
what types of solutions are more

115
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
effective or result in

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,680
in in fewer and fewer breaches so

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,840
i'm a huge fan of transparent

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,879
transparency i think this is a

119
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,199
tremendous and fundamental step forward

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
the only thing i would say is that it's

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,400
one of many transparency steps which

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,919
washington

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,639
should undertake another one should be a

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
very strong attestation from corporate

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
leadership saying

126
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
not saying we do this and we do that but

127
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,440
saying

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
we've looked at our level of cyber risk

129
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
and we are investing appropriately or

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
taking appropriate actions to mitigate

131
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
that risk

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
and so again i think even these types of

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,320
attestations another form of

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
transparency will help create a better

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
uh equilibrium for what today to date

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,919
has been just a failed a failed market

137
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,159
okay uh chad or simon

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,960
sure

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,039
i've got a few thoughts i mean to me

140
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,600
being able to assess the scale of the

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
task that we face

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
is literally impossible right now i mean

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
even the numbers from last week stating

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
i'm going to cross the ransomware road

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
but i saw the justice department

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
published a thing about 5.4 billion

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
dollars in cryptocurrency moving around

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840
and of course

149
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
all of these numbers are inaccurate

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
right that's that's a glimpse of what

151
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
the department of justice is able to see

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
it's also money called counted multiple

153
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,600
times because it was anonymized in the

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,840
process there's imperfection all over

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,199
the place with trying to assess the

156
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,280
scale of the problem that we face

157
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
and we can see it having ripples

158
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
throughout the economy and society

159
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
because we have no

160
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
we i don't know if we're underestimating

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
overestimating we don't know what's in

162
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
front of us because no one's um

163
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
reporting on these crimes so i think

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
it's incredibly important i support

165
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
everything i meet said

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
but uh you know you look at cyber

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
insurance and what a mess that industry

168
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
got into with how much payments they had

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
to make because they had no idea the

170
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
scale of what they were facing they

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
jumped in anyway which i'm not sure was

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,199
the brightest thing but

173
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
the point is like it was much bigger and

174
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
much more prominent and of course

175
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
only increased after

176
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
ransomware type crime started happening

177
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
um i've had so many conversations here

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
in canada with

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,479
the cyber police at the rcmp in ottawa

180
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
and they're like well it's really hard

181
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
for us to go to parliament and say we

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
need another four billion dollars to get

183
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
more cyber cops

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
when we can't even explain the scale of

185
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,199
the problem because nobody's reporting

186
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,639
the crime right we can tell you how many

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,080
houses were broken into in a given

188
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
postal code we can tell you how many

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
people were mugged in toronto last year

190
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,319
and that lets me put boots on the street

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,039
but i can't tell you how many people had

192
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,160
uh data stolen from their computer or

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
you know this type of crime because no

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
one's reporting it everybody feels that

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
we're ineffective or incapable of

196
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
dealing with these crimes and as a

197
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
result um

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
many of these crimes go unreported in

199
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
the in the personal space against

200
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
individuals or in the corporate space of

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
course so a lot of it ends up getting

202
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
swept under the carpet to hopefully

203
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
preserve some sort of

204
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,199
reputation and things like that so

205
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
that's my perspective that we absolutely

206
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,440
need it just to be able to assess what

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,479
we're doing and be able to judge if

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,120
we're having any impact

209
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
i would i would add

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
my concerns are always timeliness like

211
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
if if it's mandatory reporting that you

212
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
have to report within a certain amount

213
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,280
of time there are often situations where

214
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
you're not ready it's premature

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
um you have to be careful about

216
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
reporting you know the accuracy of your

217
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
report or qualifying it to say this is

218
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
our preliminary thoughts

219
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
the other thing that i'm always nervous

220
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
about with reporting is is teaching the

221
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,840
criminals

222
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
there are several examples lately in the

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
news where we

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
or the industry i should say has

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
done a great dissertation on the

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,840
mistakes criminals made in their malware

227
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,919
and their technology or their attack

228
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,080
and it just breaks my heart i mean

229
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
every time we discover really bad

230
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,599
malware we should be pimping it and

231
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,879
hyping it saying this is the most

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
advanced thing ever like i don't

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
understand it we shouldn't be teaching

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
the criminals how to do their job better

235
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
so those are the pitfalls that reporting

236
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
comes into otherwise i agree completely

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,919
with chester in a minute that the more

238
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,520
information we have on the scope of the

239
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
problem the more accurately we can apply

240
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,639
efforts to solving it

241
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
i am back gentlemen

242
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
for some reason the

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
hardwired connection in the cs

244
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
department went away

245
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
for a few moments

246
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
there was actually a momentary outage of

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
internet on the entire purdue campus so

248
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,039
it was only it was only about two

249
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,958
minutes long but but we did just lose

250
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,200
two minutes of great conversation

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
yesterday is that your time okay

252
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,480
um it must be some

253
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
some hacking group that didn't want to

254
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
have answers

255
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
about to the questions

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
well uh good i

257
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
i'm

258
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
sorry i missed some of the the

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
wise thoughts there but uh

260
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
um

261
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,920
i

262
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
i think we'll be able to

263
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
move on through

264
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
um

265
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
another thing that's been in the news

266
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,800
although not certainly is prominently

267
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
is a resurgent

268
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,000
interest in the idea of hacking back

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,120
and that certainly has both positive and

270
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
negatives associated with it

271
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,920
uh the idea that we might uh

272
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,600
have victims who attempt to disrupt or

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,399
or attack back to

274
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,640
the organizations or individuals that

275
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
that are causing them problems

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
um

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
without me going further on that i know

278
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
uh simon you and i talked about this a

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
couple years ago uh yep uh

280
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
if you

281
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
i'm sure you've got some interesting

282
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
thoughts on this

283
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,839
i am i am fully supportive of hacking

284
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
back as long as it's conducted by

285
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
military and law enforcement

286
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
like civilians we don't have the right

287
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
to do that and as much as we want to

288
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,440
it's not our place in the world uh if

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
it's done by law enforcement

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
legally or military

291
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,880
yeah

292
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
the challenge the challenge is always

293
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,320
attestation

294
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
like there are so many cyber attacks

295
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
that we have thought we knew who was

296
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
responsible and then a year or two years

297
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,920
later we've changed our minds

298
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
if you're if you are hacking back and

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
you've got it wrong you're as much a

300
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
criminal as they as they are um so get

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
it right do it legally under the guise

302
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,959
of law enforcement or military and i

303
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,680
personally don't have a problem with it

304
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
okay

305
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
uh amig

306
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
yeah i think you know for starters it's

307
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
it's illegal which is always a good

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,079
guide to as to what to do and not to do

309
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
but listen i i agree it's it's not

310
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
something that uh that private industry

311
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,279
should be

312
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
getting involved in or even advocate not

313
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
you have the problems of attribution

314
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
that simon highlighted

315
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,279
uh there's the

316
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,480
the uh the the technical challenges also

317
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
of

318
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
how you're going to hack back without

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
having

320
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
you know overflow consequences into uh

321
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,079
into uh

322
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,640
non-non-participants or innocent

323
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
bystanders and

324
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
uh and so there's all sorts of

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
challenges and

326
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
not the least of which is the technical

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
acumen of many organizations which might

328
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
consider hacking back uh and these are

329
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
the same folks that have failed to apply

330
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
a patch for more than 365 days and and

331
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,600
failed to take cis admin privileges away

332
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,279
from from local local users and and so

333
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,160
uh

334
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
i'm not a huge fan that they'll be

335
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
accurately attributing and

336
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
pinpointing the the source and

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
delivering the munitions correctly

338
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,199
anything else to add to that

339
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
yeah i mean

340
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,639
to adding to mostly what they say

341
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,600
although

342
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
a little bit of thoughts on

343
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
having more clear definitions on exactly

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
where lines are because um things are

345
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,680
evolving quickly we're

346
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
we have a rapid response team and one of

347
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
the things that often happens when we're

348
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
we're not doing forensics per se we're

349
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,560
coming in just to kick the bad guys out

350
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,399
of the network and assess what happened

351
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
enough for the the victim to begin to

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
recover so we're not doing full

353
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
forensics like a mandiant or something

354
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,079
might do

355
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,800
so

356
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,880
we're really truly rapid response get in

357
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
there kick the bad guys out and help the

358
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
customer assess where they're at so they

359
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,519
can make a plan to start recovering from

360
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
their attack and in that scenario

361
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,279
three quarters or more of the cases

362
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
these days data's been stolen in a lot

363
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
of cases that data is now sitting on a

364
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,639
criminal owned dropbox or

365
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,519
mega.cod.nz or

366
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
some file sharing service and the

367
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,519
password's been left behind and so

368
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
there's vagaries of things like that is

369
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,959
that hacking back if i log into the

370
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,040
criminals mega account to delete the

371
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,760
data they stole from me that's my data

372
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
um you know is that hacking back is that

373
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
uh is that

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
you know is that uh

375
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
in violation of the computer fraud abuse

376
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,839
act i'm accessing somebody else's

377
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
account without the clearly without

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
their intentional permission

379
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
um

380
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
so i think there are fuzzy areas like

381
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,240
that where it can be valuable i believe

382
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
victims in that scenario should

383
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,959
absolutely be able to at least uh

384
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
ascertain what data is on that drive of

385
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,320
theirs so that they can understand the

386
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,399
scope of their incident if not in fact

387
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
delete that data from the criminals

388
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
but that's very different than

389
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
necessarily truly attacking back you

390
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
know doing an actual offensive operation

391
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
against the the adversary because again

392
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
in so many of the cases that we're

393
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
involved in um the fbi may already be

394
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
investigating the group that we're

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,839
trying to help the victim recover from

396
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
and we don't know that we might if we

397
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,279
were to do anything proactive at all we

398
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,480
could be disrupting an active

399
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
investigation and and making it even

400
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
worse not even let alone helping so uh

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
the only the only disagreement i have

402
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,959
there is just those kind of fuzzy edges

403
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,160
now where

404
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
sometimes you're able to maybe get

405
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
access to your own things um even on the

406
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,480
dark web and uh you know

407
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
do we have to bring in the fbi every

408
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
single time and the time lost in

409
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,199
engaging

410
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
the law enforcement could be the time

411
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
difference between the criminal actually

412
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
disseminating your information and being

413
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
able to keep it private

414
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
well somebody with fuzzy edges i sort of

415
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,320
uh

416
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,800
resonate with that um

417
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
are there comments from the panelists to

418
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,120
that i i would i would say

419
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,399
i think chester makes a really good

420
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,560
point um

421
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
i guess i am perhaps privileged because

422
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
i have a good relationship with the fbi

423
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
and the secret service because the size

424
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
of my skirt and i know if i called them

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,560
and said hey can i delete this

426
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,399
i'd get a very quick response i do

427
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,040
appreciate that not every company has

428
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
such a relationship

429
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
but i have never found in the u.s law

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,399
enforcement be anything less than

431
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
helpful and positive in situations like

432
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,480
this there's no downside in engaging

433
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
them at all

434
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,399
um

435
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,920
to be clear simon

436
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,199
that's absolutely been the case for us

437
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,639
as well yeah like because we're dealing

438
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,000
with quantities of these we have

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
relationships now with many fbi field

440
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,760
offices and they've always given us the

441
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
go ahead when it's a reasonable request

442
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
but i think individual organizations

443
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
that may not have those relationships or

444
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,959
may not have a third party like us

445
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,240
involved where we've already established

446
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
those relationships

447
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
it becomes this fuzzy thing for them and

448
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,880
i think we should we or should we should

449
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
make it clear what you're saying we

450
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,199
should just make it you know try to get

451
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,399
the word out to everybody you know what

452
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,000
join in for guard build that

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
relationship so it's there and the day

454
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,639
you need it you just pick up the phone

455
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,320
and go you call your local guy and he

456
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
said sure

457
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
listen i i'm a huge believer join in for

458
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
guard engage with fbi know who your

459
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,360
local

460
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
guy is

461
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,600
uh

462
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,079
i would also add that you know a vast

463
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
majority of general counsels that i have

464
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
worked with in the past would not uh

465
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
would not uh you know favor that

466
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
response or say yeah this is the first

467
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,519
call

468
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
you know the first call we should make

469
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,199
they'd be very reluctant to get the fbi

470
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
or law enforcement involved and and

471
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
sometimes there are differences of um

472
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
differences of objectives between law

473
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,800
enforcement which is primarily

474
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
interested in prosecution of of crimes

475
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,959
and

476
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,480
you know those trying to defend networks

477
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,279
and keep their operations safe and and

478
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
and resilient and repair right i mean

479
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
law enforcement may want to fishbowl

480
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,759
something and observe and monitoring and

481
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
track back and trace and and that isn't

482
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
necessarily in the best interest

483
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
at all times of

484
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
of the operators there's another great

485
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
question in the q a panel says do we

486
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
have the right to set decoys

487
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
and point clinical poison data that

488
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
impacts the adversary's environments

489
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
which is something that i

490
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
uh and maybe i'm drawing a fine line

491
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
i like to uh draw a distinction and say

492
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,560
in my opinion that doesn't feel like

493
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,759
hacking back

494
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,079
the the the couple of lawyers that have

495
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
spoken to on this topic uh vehemently

496
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,800
disagree and say that you cannot

497
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
create you know for instance a pdf or a

498
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,199
document with some malware in it and put

499
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,279
it off in a honey

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
network or honey system and say hey

501
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,600
anybody that grabs that and brings it to

502
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
their environment you know deserves what

503
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,720
they what they get

504
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
that is in fact at least a cup according

505
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,839
to the two lawyers that i've spoken to

506
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,240
that is in fact illegal to do so

507
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
that may uh

508
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
there may be other uh other other

509
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,559
commentary on that no

510
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
yeah it's interesting it's the same same

511
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
laws as applies to putting a poisoned

512
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
lunch in the staff fridge

513
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,359
yeah you cannot knowingly poison

514
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,400
somebody

515
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,919
but you could put a distasteful lunch in

516
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
there that's fine

517
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,919
well i guess there's a difference

518
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
between a beacon and malware too right

519
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
you look at things like things canary

520
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,640
which is simply a beacon which

521
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
arguably every website's doing to us

522
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
with cookies so they can sell us the

523
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,400
right brand of underwear or whatever

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,919
they're trying to put on amazon tomorrow

525
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,360
so

526
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,559
there's a you know there's kind of a

527
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,760
fine line between something that's

528
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,039
malicious and something something that

529
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,000
simply lets you know that um i've uh uh

530
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,160
you know been triggered and but

531
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
potentially i'm i'm now sitting at this

532
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
ip address if you're more interested in

533
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
knowing who might have opened it

534
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
let me circle around uh back to uh

535
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
something that immediate said about

536
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
corporate lawyers not being very

537
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
supportive of doing these kind of things

538
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
would this be something that

539
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
if they knew that there was a 24-hour

540
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
mandatory reporting deadline

541
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
that they be

542
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
less reluctant to

543
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,320
allow people to make that call

544
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
that's kind of directed at any of you

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,520
but

546
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,760
yeah i listen i i do think that having

547
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
you know whether it's 24 hours you know

548
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
regardless what the time period is if if

549
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,960
there's a a regulatory requirement

550
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
to provide

551
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,559
notification to or through law

552
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
enforcement or to some other mechanism

553
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,760
then you know most general counsels

554
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
you know that i've worked with would

555
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
would uh would say we need to comply

556
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,320
with the

557
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
regulations the laws and and

558
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
so that would that would perhaps open

559
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,799
open paths of communication that don't

560
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,360
exist today

561
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
well now let me expand this a little bit

562
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
uh because all three of you work with

563
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
organizations with international reach

564
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
and we've been talking sort of about the

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
u.s situation

566
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
but that's obviously not the case

567
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,360
internationally that other countries

568
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,679
have different laws and regulations

569
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,679
um what do you see there in terms of

570
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,080
international norms or the direction

571
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
uh where these kinds of issues of

572
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,360
reporting

573
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
and uh

574
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,039
right of self-action

575
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
uh how do those sort of play out

576
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
internationally and and simon i'll i'll

577
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
ask you first

578
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
to respond to this yeah it's very very

579
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
complex

580
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,480
and we assess

581
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,360
140 different

582
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,120
countries regulations when we do

583
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
anything in cyber

584
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
and we spend a lot with external counsel

585
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
and legal

586
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
it is very variable and ever-changing

587
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
there's no

588
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
no stability at all

589
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
so uh

590
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,240
to put the corporate lawyers hat on

591
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
everything becomes a risk decision uh

592
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,919
you know we look at where our major

593
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,400
business flows are and we try and guess

594
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
where the biggest legal liabilities are

595
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
and every now and again we get called

596
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
out like nigeria and morocco have

597
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
ferociously tough cyber security laws

598
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,039
that are that are interpreted very

599
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,200
uh very harshly

600
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
and and sometimes result in criminal

601
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
proceedings so some things like hacking

602
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
back like doing a port scan in morocco

603
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
would could get you sent to jail um

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
individually so

605
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
it becomes a risk decision if you want

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
to do that and of course critical

607
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
infrastructure in russia and china you

608
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
know if you accidentally do a pen test

609
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,799
against somebody considered a critical

610
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
infrastructure it could be a bank or a

611
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
municipality

612
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,520
huge

613
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
huge problems

614
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,679
so

615
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
yeah as as

616
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
companies develop international business

617
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,559
keeping abreast of the particular cyber

618
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,000
security tone

619
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
within those countries is difficult and

620
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
the best advice i give to small

621
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,120
companies is look what everybody else is

622
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
doing if you are about to break new

623
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,840
ground and do a new thing be very very

624
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,159
cautious if you're doing what other

625
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
people seem to be doing

626
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,880
you may be on safe territory um

627
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
but that doesn't you know just copying

628
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
doesn't protect you from from liability

629
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,360
right well tenable makes a premier

630
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
product that does some of that reach out

631
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
in testing so what's been your

632
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,918
experience

633
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
in our uh

634
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
license agreements and usage agreements

635
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,559
we've we do have uh you know the terms

636
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,240
of use which require that you're

637
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
complying with the local laws

638
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
jurisdictions authorities that you have

639
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
and so on and so forth so

640
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
uh it's not uh it's not perfect by any

641
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,240
stretch

642
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,679
but it is something that we have

643
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,640
enforced on occasion and and we have

644
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,520
been uh you know notified by

645
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
law enforcement and various geographies

646
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
that

647
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
necessarily nessus which you wouldn't

648
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
have visibility into but that our sas

649
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,080
platforms have been used to

650
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,320
poke and prod into other people's

651
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,679
environments and sometimes it's as

652
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,760
simple as a misconfiguration

653
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,799
uh you fat fingering in an ip range that

654
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,640
doesn't belong to you and and sometimes

655
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,520
it's

656
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
uh it's a little bit more involved than

657
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
that but it is something that we

658
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
you know i'd say put forth a pretty

659
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
strong effort to enforce where we are

660
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,200
made aware of uh transgressions

661
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,320
okay

662
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
anything

663
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
uh more on the breach notification side

664
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,360
of things and things like that i mean

665
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
i've got a bit more visibility there

666
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
from my perspective in that well one

667
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
similar to the u.s i just noticed

668
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,080
yesterday that in canada

669
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
in a bill that's actually related to

670
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
freedom of information changes they're

671
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,559
making they're going to slip in a

672
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,400
mandatory breach notification it looks

673
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
like if that bill passes so very similar

674
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
legislation it looks like to what's

675
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
being proposed in the united states

676
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,080
which is not uncommon canada and the us

677
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
often have very similar rules there um

678
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
what's interesting to me more is the the

679
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
gdpr side when it kicked in and watching

680
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
interacting with a lot of victims in

681
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
europe after gdpr passed and the

682
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
quantity of them that are willing to

683
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
risk

684
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,080
the regulatory penalties of hiding their

685
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
breaches and not reporting them and

686
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
collaborating with criminals on

687
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
well we'll pay the criminal to keep

688
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
quiet so we don't have to report this

689
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
because if we report it we think the

690
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
outcome's going to be worse than getting

691
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,159
the criminal to be quiet

692
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
and that's a little disturbing um i mean

693
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
it's not like half or more than half or

694
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,480
anything like that but it's it's a lot

695
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
larger number of them than i would have

696
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
expected

697
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
have chosen

698
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,280
to

699
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
not disclose when they're legally

700
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
obligated to do so so these laws in

701
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
their past are no

702
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
magic panacea of thing i mean

703
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
organizations are still going to

704
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
do what they think is in their best

705
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
interest even if it means violating the

706
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
rules um and and if they have to they'll

707
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,880
pay their penalty

708
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,120
all right

709
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
um a follow-up question from somebody in

710
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
the in the audience

711
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,279
would a well implemented drm solution go

712
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,679
a long way to protecting sensitive data

713
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,919
exposure within or outside an

714
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,159
organization and are there pitfalls

715
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,440
beyond the

716
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
just simply the complexity to implement

717
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
have this

718
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,159
have this work so

719
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
thoughts by anyone on that

720
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,120
yeah i guess this is why cso's uh let's

721
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
say make a lot of money but have have

722
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,480
the opportunity to really contribute to

723
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
their their organizations you know

724
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
um solutions can certainly be part of

725
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
uh you know the overall the overall

726
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,360
approach

727
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
there are a lot of implementation

728
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
challenges

729
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
first of all it's not

730
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
foolproof second of all there's a lot of

731
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
nuance and complexity and properly

732
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,320
implementing drm or many other security

733
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
solutions including you know how well do

734
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,799
you understand your data how well do you

735
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,840
uh classify it how well do you discover

736
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
where it is where it isn't

737
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
how

738
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
flexible are the systems that you choose

739
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,120
to implement drm on top of or next to

740
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,039
uh because you know they can also get in

741
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,440
the way of productivity and

742
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,520
ease of use and the things which make

743
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
you know which really drive efficiency

744
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,440
in the organization so i i think drm can

745
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,919
be a part of it but it is

746
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
historically

747
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,960
suffered from a lot of these challenges

748
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
to implementation

749
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,480
absolutely a well-implemented drm

750
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
that would be a really good thing at

751
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
reducing the risk

752
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
it's

753
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,960
it's a very challenging space though

754
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
very challenging

755
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,159
um i think something that small

756
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
companies can do really well

757
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,919
but as you as your company grows in size

758
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,480
and complexity drm gets very difficult

759
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
sometimes to implement

760
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
well um

761
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
here's another question that was

762
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,720
inspired by this

763
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,400
and i'll alter this a little bit but uh

764
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
we have many malicious actors

765
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,880
who

766
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
appear to be acting with impunity

767
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
they're operating from locations where

768
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,039
they have

769
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,520
some protection potentially from the

770
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
national government or in the case for

771
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,880
instance of north korea

772
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
they actually are the government

773
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,080
and

774
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
the

775
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,679
at least the observed

776
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,400
kinds of consequences for those actions

777
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
so far has been

778
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
either ineffective or nil

779
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
this is a difficult area obviously for a

780
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,559
lot of reasons

781
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
what what do you think would be

782
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,120
appropriate

783
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,480
consequences that can be carried out

784
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
if not by the commercial

785
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,919
entities by governments collections of

786
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,120
governments

787
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,639
that would have some deterrent effect

788
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,799
again i i think all three of you can

789
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
comment to this but so any of you are

790
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,520
welcome to take the lead

791
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
well it seems to me like i mean

792
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
this is really a political issue more

793
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
than anything else because uh obviously

794
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,240
the

795
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,799
we we've seen very few cases but

796
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
beginning uh the fbi seemingly taking

797
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
some proactive action against some of

798
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,799
these ransomware criminals uh in the

799
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,600
case of the solar or not solar winds uh

800
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,080
i forget which one it was now that they

801
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
went

802
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
clearly disrupted the command of control

803
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
in the and got some of the bitcoin back

804
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,440
from colonial pipeline and like we've

805
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
not really seen publicly any um

806
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
offensive actions on behalf of the us

807
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
government everything they've done

808
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,640
previously had been completely secret

809
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,559
and never talked about if anything was

810
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,559
done at all and now we're starting to

811
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,520
see

812
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,559
uh

813
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
them not only doing a little bit but

814
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,879
taking

815
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,480
being okay with it being public letting

816
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,679
the public know that they are taking

817
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,279
some action and they are getting engaged

818
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
and trying to disrupt some of this

819
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,840
criminal activity uh but the the

820
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,880
challenge is like you say spaff i mean

821
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
we've seen actors in russia that are

822
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,840
daytime gru

823
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,559
evening personal crime and we see the

824
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,080
same thing in iran and we see the same

825
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
thing in china mss and the daytime cyber

826
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
crime in the evenings or the weekends

827
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
for fun you know

828
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
and uh

829
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
they're i mean they're government

830
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
officials right in some way or another

831
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
they're they're officers of mss they're

832
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,919
officers at gru they're they're

833
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,279
i mean

834
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,039
what can be done other than the

835
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,440
sanctions and the international warrants

836
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
and uh

837
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
you know indictments uh that are

838
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
we only of course see the unsealed ones

839
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
there's tons more that are are sealed

840
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
which are the really valuable ones

841
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
because other ones where we actually

842
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
think we're going to get someone and we

843
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
don't want them to know they're indicted

844
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
so we can get them

845
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,399
i think we should give them all free

846
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,879
tickets to disneyland

847
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,000
okay so yeah chester brings it up that

848
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,320
there is we know who these people are

849
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,080
we know in many cases where they live i

850
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
mean the intelligence we know exactly

851
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
who these people are we are unable to

852
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,679
act

853
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,080
uh through our domestic law enforcement

854
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
international law enforcement is

855
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
somewhat stifled the opportunity for

856
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
sanctions and the economic constraints

857
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
against those countries to force action

858
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
is is there

859
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
um

860
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
even domestically if you look at the

861
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
average time to prosecution for a

862
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,159
domestic u.s domestic cyber criminal

863
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,200
it's years it's multiple years of

864
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,360
them operating before they finally are

865
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,399
jailed

866
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,919
um so

867
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,240
law enforcement is

868
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,760
is due a shake-up in terms of this uh

869
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,440
very unusual threat which is

870
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
geographically unlimited and equally you

871
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,080
know equally achievable from anywhere in

872
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
the world

873
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,080
um

874
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,120
yeah it needs to be faster and more

875
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,360
international corporate cooperation

876
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,679
and taken a lot more seriously in terms

877
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,000
of economic sanctions and geopolitical

878
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,080
power

879
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,559
here's what i found

880
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,520
i

881
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,600
i generally i i agree i think that you

882
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
know the government can this is an area

883
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
where the government can uh has been

884
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
starting

885
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
to be more active and can certainly be

886
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,159
more active i think the

887
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,520
the indictments that we've seen in

888
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,240
recent years are an incredibly important

889
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
move

890
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,200
uh if and and you know many people say

891
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,399
okay well you know if they're never

892
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,360
gonna

893
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,679
uh step foot into jail or be held

894
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,440
accountable then then this is a waste of

895
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
time i disagree um

896
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,679
if we

897
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,880
uh

898
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
uh indict folks

899
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,919
it is it sends an important uh signal in

900
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
terms of acceptable behavior on and

901
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
establishing international norms of

902
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
behavior which over time become

903
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
customary international law so it's

904
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
incredibly important that we are

905
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
very loud and forceful when these crimes

906
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
occur even if it doesn't feel like

907
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
there's immediate gratification

908
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,080
the government response is

909
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,679
generally should fall into two

910
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
categories there's the the retorts which

911
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,360
are the legal activities the you know

912
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,039
persona non grata people out of the

913
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,840
country implement sanctions changes in

914
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
trade posture and agreements and and

915
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
then there are the

916
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,080
the uh category of

917
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
uh not necessarily legal but uh still

918
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
regularly achieved countermeasures so

919
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,159
uh things like hacking back and and i

920
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,519
think as simon mentioned some of those

921
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
are visible some of them are not and i

922
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
think the government should do a better

923
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,840
job

924
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,480
uh educating the public and the world at

925
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
large about which ones are visible and

926
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
why

927
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,559
uh and and and that can create more and

928
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,200
greater deterrence but there's other uh

929
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,519
actions whole of government responses

930
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,519
things like freezing assets

931
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,039
you know i don't think we've seen cyber

932
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,799
attacks get to the point of renditions

933
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,519
but

934
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
uh you know we should leave all options

935
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
on the table uh and i think that does

936
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,159
add to add to deterrence but the

937
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,120
conclusion here uh like it or not is is

938
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
ultimately the same and i think will be

939
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,559
the same for years to come which is

940
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,880
the government

941
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,960
for combinations of political will or

942
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
inability cannot keep you safe can i

943
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
keep your organization safe and so while

944
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,799
we can cooperate with law enforcement

945
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,039
and encourage all these things to happen

946
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,640
we're operating very much in the wild

947
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,519
west and every organization needs to

948
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,279
exercise a

949
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,360
high degree of care and and protect

950
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,039
themselves and that's just

951
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,880
you know better worse the world that we

952
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
live in and we'll continue living in for

953
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,960
the for the foreseeable future

954
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,240
let's look at the other side of the coin

955
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,840
though we talked about like punitive

956
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
damage putative efforts against these

957
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
mastermind criminals

958
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
but what about the tens of thousands of

959
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,039
yahoo boys in nigeria who individually

960
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,519
are causing tremendous like disruption

961
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,440
to vulnerable people

962
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,799
but they're clawing their way out of

963
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,039
abject poverty you know

964
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
how do you

965
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
what do you do about you know those guys

966
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,519
who are just attacking by a social media

967
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,720
phishing

968
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
extorting grandparents and elderly and

969
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,480
vulnerable people

970
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
you know having an international law

971
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,519
enforcement act against them is

972
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,960
tremendously difficult maybe the

973
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
response there is is instead to look at

974
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,919
how we can offer support and assistance

975
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,720
to

976
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,159
change those people so they don't

977
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,399
gravitate towards cybercrime

978
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
uh you know the entry-level cybercrime

979
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,399
that they are given more opportunity

980
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
and change the systemic mechanisms that

981
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,320
they're taking advantage of right i mean

982
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
if

983
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
if it's taking advantage of you know

984
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,039
elderly or somebody who just can give

985
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,519
their password online or or you know on

986
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,240
the on the phone and fall victim then i

987
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,080
would say systemically that's a pretty

988
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,399
horrific design by whoever's

989
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,080
implementing and offering and offering

990
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
that as a service so

991
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,000
maybe ascribing some degree of liability

992
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,559
to uh to those parties might be

993
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
uh might be worthwhile although this is

994
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,159
certainly going to be only agreed to by

995
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,559
the cyber uh professionals

996
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,360
well

997
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,279
there's there's two i mean the nigeria

998
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,960
is quite strict with this stuff and to

999
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,880
be fair i mean i i they uh i follow

1000
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,320
their cyber crime twitter feed and

1001
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
they're they're arresting large groups

1002
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,360
of people on a pretty regular basis

1003
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,480
actually they're involved in a lot of

1004
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
these crimes they're very aggressive in

1005
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,679
law enforcement there as you pointed out

1006
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,760
earlier with the rules and the laws and

1007
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
they aren't trying to enforce them and

1008
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,560
they seem i just saw yesterday more

1009
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,480
indictments come through for for uh

1010
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,079
nigerian criminals that were targeting

1011
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,480
u.s entities um that

1012
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,599
came through yesterday from the

1013
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,520
department of justice so i would say

1014
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,359
we're having more success in actual law

1015
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,199
enforcement of cyber crime in nigeria

1016
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,719
than we are in america i mean they're

1017
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,040
they're quite aggressive about it

1018
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,719
i'm not sure to your point that we

1019
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,960
should like the systemic causes would be

1020
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,239
a much better way of addressing it

1021
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,679
considering the poverty and the issues

1022
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,839
that are causing it it'd be better to

1023
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
like have it stop for for good reasons

1024
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,760
um but from a law enforcement

1025
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,918
perspective they're not um they're not

1026
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,079
capable and when you said that it just

1027
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,520
kind of triggered in my mind i mean how

1028
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960
is this different than what's happening

1029
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,280
in moldova or russia or belarus or

1030
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
like you've got highly trained computer

1031
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
science professionals that were well

1032
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,359
educated in the 1980s and 90s and 2000s

1033
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
who can't find legitimate work who end

1034
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,200
up getting caught up in these groups

1035
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,440
being coders for them and and helping

1036
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,040
them figure out how to launder the money

1037
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,480
and stuff i mean these are incredibly

1038
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
well educated people that

1039
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,400
if they were in warsaw

1040
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
facebook would be happy to hire them and

1041
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,280
and and put them to work but somehow

1042
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
they're in a dysfunctional economy

1043
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
that's leading them to conduct these

1044
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
crimes so can we extend that idea from

1045
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,800
nigeria into these

1046
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
former soviet republics into cis

1047
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,720
countries as well because it seems like

1048
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
that's an awful lot of talent working

1049
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,959
the wrong direction

1050
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,000
very good point

1051
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,520
well

1052
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,480
uh there's really that's the more

1053
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,839
general question i think in a lot of

1054
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,079
ways is

1055
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,200
how

1056
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
do we

1057
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,800
uh train or or encourage anyone

1058
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
to use what they're doing more for the

1059
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,359
good and it's an economic issue

1060
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,680
eventually is what it comes down to

1061
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
because as you know there are some

1062
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
people just trying to make a living for

1063
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
their families

1064
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
although i think some of the crime gangs

1065
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,640
that have pulled in

1066
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,720
2.3 billion dollars over the last five

1067
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,680
years

1068
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
uh either they've got a very large

1069
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
family or they're a little bit beyond

1070
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,440
what they need

1071
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,839
uh so let's let's look at this from a

1072
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,560
different perspective

1073
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,440
many of the victims when we look at

1074
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
after action kind of reports

1075
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
have been

1076
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,480
negligent

1077
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
at worst or careless

1078
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
in applying

1079
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,200
basic sound security practice

1080
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
including as was mentioned earlier

1081
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,160
patches in a timely fashion

1082
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,680
but other kinds of things such as uh

1083
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,760
the idea now of zero trust is certainly

1084
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,920
caught on although the ideas behind zero

1085
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,560
trust we were talking about 25 30 years

1086
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,200
ago as basic security practice

1087
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,800
that people didn't pick up then either

1088
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,440
how much blame

1089
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
should be apportioned to some of these

1090
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
victims

1091
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,720
for not following basic practice and

1092
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,280
what do we do to encourage them

1093
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,000
to

1094
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
get with the program and do a better job

1095
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,599
of cleaning up after themselves now

1096
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,400
simon i know there's a pci standards

1097
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,480
that we use for merchants but but how do

1098
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
we make that more general

1099
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
yeah that concept of personal

1100
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
responsibility is

1101
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
is

1102
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
a difficult one different social groups

1103
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,160
have different levels of expertise um

1104
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
but staff you and i have talked about

1105
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
this with 50 years into this industry

1106
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
now at least and we still can't get the

1107
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
basics right you know we still can't get

1108
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
people to think about password security

1109
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,839
and you know patching

1110
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,520
patching shouldn't be a complicated

1111
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
topic to people i mean everyone with a

1112
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,680
smart tv is used to patching now yeah

1113
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
everyone with the

1114
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,240
game gaming console is hatching

1115
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,400
um but still it's a mystery to most

1116
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
people and also most people think cyber

1117
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,680
security is not their problem that's

1118
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
somebody else's problem that's the

1119
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
bank's problem the telephone company's

1120
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
problem the game console's problem the

1121
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
maker of the tv's problem

1122
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
it's

1123
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,800
it's something i would like to see as

1124
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,040
like a you know very early on in

1125
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
schooling

1126
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
but i would probably want to see fiscal

1127
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,240
you know financial acumen even more

1128
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
important there's some there's some core

1129
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,200
skills we're missing in schools right

1130
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,359
now some security is one of them

1131
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,280
the question is is it the most important

1132
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,680
um i would you know this forum of course

1133
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,599
we would say it is but then there's

1134
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
critical thinking fiscal you know

1135
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
financial acumen other things that

1136
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
society is kind of quite weak on at the

1137
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
moment

1138
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,960
it's it's very i mean it's very

1139
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,599
different based on who

1140
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,440
we're addressing right there's there's

1141
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
consumers and then there's sort of like

1142
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,240
small and mid-sized businesses and then

1143
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
there's enterprises and they're very

1144
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,480
different answers i think to how you get

1145
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
people to come along with doing those

1146
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,079
things right on the consumer side almost

1147
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,839
all the things simon pointed out those

1148
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,119
things happen automatically or don't

1149
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,560
really give you a choice like i know you

1150
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
want to play xbox right now but you

1151
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,520
can't play xbox because it's buying an

1152
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
update and you don't have a choice like

1153
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,720
it's just doing it and you're just going

1154
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
to wait 10 minutes to play xbox

1155
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,280
and uh or your smart tv or these kinds

1156
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,560
of things right we we don't give

1157
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,000
consumers choices anymore because we

1158
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
know the choices do it later and they'll

1159
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
never do it

1160
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
but in the enterprise i think some of

1161
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
this can be addressed through insurance

1162
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,640
and audit and things i mean the bottom

1163
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,000
line is we saw the insurance company

1164
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
take a bath the insurance companies take

1165
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,720
a bath on a lot of these ransomware

1166
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
policies and part of that is that there

1167
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,119
was pretty much no requirement at all

1168
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,800
that you'd do anything and instead of

1169
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,920
doing

1170
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,359
anything to improve their security they

1171
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,400
were just covering their butt with a

1172
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
policy and hoping that if they had an

1173
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,000
incident the insurance company would pay

1174
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,280
out and that has to stop right like if

1175
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
those companies want to be insured the

1176
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
the carrot and the stick is you either

1177
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
don't get insurance if you don't meet

1178
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,960
some reasonable qualifications

1179
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,680
uh and those qualifications obviously

1180
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,480
can

1181
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
vary the price of those policies

1182
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
depending on how

1183
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,760
mature your security posture is but of

1184
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,839
course to assess that maturity means

1185
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,000
doing some sort of an audit or something

1186
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,119
has to be involved to assess the

1187
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,800
maturity level and that doesn't scale

1188
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,319
right i mean it scales if you're a large

1189
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,760
organization and you're negotiating

1190
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,920
million dollar insurance contracts you

1191
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,520
darn well want to prove that you meet

1192
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,040
certain requirements to get a discount

1193
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
and to get better coverage that doesn't

1194
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,520
work for 50 person small businesses that

1195
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,599
that obviously wouldn't be cost

1196
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,440
effective in order to truly assess their

1197
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,599
security posture so i think we have to

1198
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,839
think about these things in the

1199
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160
the resources available to address the

1200
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,680
problem and the resource for a consumer

1201
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,760
to address is kind of almost none if you

1202
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
just don't do it for them

1203
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,800
and in small business there's certainly

1204
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
some responsibility but at the

1205
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
enterprise side

1206
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,880
i i think we do know what mature

1207
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,040
programs look like we know that

1208
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
organizations that threat hunt are going

1209
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
to be far more successful at defending

1210
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,040
themselves from any adversary than those

1211
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,960
that are purely reactive we know that

1212
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
you know it's not about the brand of

1213
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,839
which tools you have per se but we know

1214
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,480
the the hallmarks of a mature program

1215
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,319
and we're not currently doing anything

1216
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,400
to incent organizations to mature their

1217
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
programs other than they personally

1218
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
discovered that it was a good idea

1219
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,240
i i'm i'm probably on the uh

1220
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,920
on the extreme side of holding

1221
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,079
organizations accountable i think

1222
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,720
generally speaking you know the basics

1223
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
of how to secure yourself are well

1224
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,680
understood

1225
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,720
and

1226
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,640
generally speaking many organizations

1227
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,599
fail disastrously disastrously at doing

1228
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,480
so

1229
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
uh and and behave in what i would

1230
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,079
characterize as a negligent fashion

1231
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,040
um

1232
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,800
if we understand the basics of how to

1233
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
protect yourself

1234
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,520
we should have an expectation that

1235
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
organizations

1236
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,280
uh the businesses

1237
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,640
have gone through the effort they

1238
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,040
understand that they have the know-how

1239
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
if they're a large enough organization

1240
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,240
if they're a small enough organization

1241
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,640
they either hire them or know how or use

1242
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
providers which can

1243
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,400
which can deliver those capabilities to

1244
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,640
them

1245
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,280
in most cases that i'm aware of it's

1246
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,960
either a matter of not wanting to incur

1247
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,240
the cost

1248
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,200
which

1249
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
i would say tough but hey that's

1250
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,280
the cost of doing business or not having

1251
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,319
the cultural will to say we value

1252
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,240
security and i think that that point has

1253
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,599
also been made

1254
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,280
and and listen by all means i'm not

1255
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,720
saying everybody

1256
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,800
should be secure at all times and if you

1257
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,040
fail to apply a patch you should be held

1258
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
accountable but what i am saying is that

1259
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,359
we can look at an organization's culture

1260
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,119
and their behavior and say

1261
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,359
yeah generally speaking they're you know

1262
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,880
high critical whatever however you want

1263
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
to characterize it

1264
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,839
issues they're addressing within a

1265
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,800
24-hour period 36 hour period five day

1266
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,200
period whatever the standard is

1267
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,920
or they're generally pretty lacks about

1268
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,160
their security practices

1269
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
they're using passwords instead of mfa

1270
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
they're they're you know local sysadmin

1271
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,040
privileges they're not applying fixes on

1272
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,400
a regular basis and say you know what

1273
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,520
this is just

1274
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,440
negligent behavior and

1275
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,760
there are very few almost no instances

1276
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,079
where we're holding folks accountable

1277
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,119
for uh for that level of of negligence

1278
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,200
and and i think that is uh

1279
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
really holding back

1280
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,920
a culture a business culture which could

1281
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
dramatically improve uh security

1282
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
so where do we

1283
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,960
sorry

1284
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,640
i would add a modification to amit

1285
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,000
because i don't

1286
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
i think businesses have a right to

1287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,920
choose their level of risk

1288
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,760
you could decide not to implement any

1289
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,920
cyber security that's a valid business

1290
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,359
decision i don't think it's a sensible

1291
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,160
one but it's valid you you are allowed

1292
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
to do that

1293
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
but as i met says if you choose not to

1294
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,640
have mature cyber security practices

1295
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,280
and you get hit by something and lose

1296
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,240
data there should be consequences

1297
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,599
and you know the consequence could be

1298
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,680
your cyber insurance policy premiums go

1299
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,560
up you lose your bbb rating et cetera et

1300
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,920
cetera et cetera

1301
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,800
um

1302
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
that's the bit that's not really clear

1303
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,079
for every business right now is how to

1304
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,599
measure it how to decide and the

1305
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,839
consequences of your choice

1306
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,000
sorry no no no that i i agree

1307
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,359
wholeheartedly which is i think the

1308
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,960
first question that's baff asked which

1309
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,000
is

1310
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,160
transparency around mandatory reporting

1311
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
right so the consequences are are

1312
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,560
understood and perhaps even transparency

1313
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,760
around

1314
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,319
your risk management practices and so

1315
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,720
that investors or customers or people

1316
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,480
giving you their data or using you as a

1317
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,800
vendor can can say oh these guys just

1318
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,720
have decided not to do cyber security

1319
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,000
and that's okay because they're the

1320
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,079
cheapest vendor and i'm willing to to

1321
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,720
accept you know their risk decisions or

1322
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,000
or it's not okay but without the

1323
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,520
transparency

1324
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
uh you know that that becomes without

1325
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,680
the transparency or the accountability

1326
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
it just becomes the the kind of failed

1327
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
ecosystem that we find ourselves in

1328
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,599
what what do you do about the

1329
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,359
the broad middle where they don't

1330
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,640
understand that the risk that they're

1331
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,480
taking on right they're not making an

1332
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
educated risk assessment they think they

1333
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,480
don't need it i mean the number of

1334
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,240
clients that we see victimized that are

1335
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
like well we didn't think it would ever

1336
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,599
hit us like we only hear it on tv when

1337
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,079
it's target and it's sony and it's

1338
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,280
this kind of thing right it's not

1339
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,359
hitting small businesses in idaho so why

1340
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,880
do i need to worry about this and then

1341
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,960
they're victimized and they're like well

1342
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
we didn't know like we we literally made

1343
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,720
a bad decision because we had bad input

1344
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,960
and i think that's what as an industry

1345
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,200
we can do is to try to figure out ways

1346
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,280
to get that message out to these people

1347
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,960
that we're not fear-mongering to sell

1348
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,480
you security software even though i have

1349
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,079
something to sell you

1350
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,680
like this is actually happening to

1351
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,599
people just like you and and you need to

1352
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,880
understand that we're not going to tell

1353
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,319
you what risk decision to make it's up

1354
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,000
to you to make that decision but you're

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,760
making you make a well-informed decision

1356
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,040
with your eyes wide open and i don't

1357
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,560
think they are and that's why so many of

1358
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,240
them are falling victim i don't think

1359
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,720
it's our job to inform them

1360
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,920
we could never you know that's pushing

1361
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,520
water uphill and we'll do our best and

1362
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,040
we'll beat our wardrobes as we have for

1363
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,240
years

1364
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,640
i think we have to make it their job

1365
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,760
to understand the risks associated with

1366
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,440
the business that they're in and how

1367
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,760
they conduct business and and that's

1368
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,440
again where i go back to attestation and

1369
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,760
saying listen as a ceo i've got to

1370
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
attest to the to you know the accuracy

1371
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,839
of our financial reporting and that

1372
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,240
means i have to spend time with my cfo i

1373
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,920
have to spend time with my auditors i

1374
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
have to you know really dig in and and

1375
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,800
uh you know and make an attestation that

1376
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,319
uh you know that my word is behind or

1377
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,520
there's consequences and i think the

1378
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,480
same has to be true of other forms of

1379
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,319
business risk including

1380
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,960
uh including cyber risk and so whether

1381
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,480
it's the ceo

1382
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
you know the board of directors but

1383
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,440
somebody's got to be able to stand up

1384
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,640
and say you know what

1385
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,240
we looked at this

1386
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,839
and we've

1387
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,359
measured it we've looked at it we've dug

1388
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,200
into it and we're taking the appropriate

1389
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,040
action and and just

1390
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
having them the test

1391
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,200
that they're looking at it i think is

1392
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,800
what might sound silly i think is a big

1393
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
step forward

1394
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,960
so some of us feel we do have an

1395
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,280
obligation to inform so in my space

1396
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
because as fast as i hold the entire

1397
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,520
merchant and banking community of the

1398
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,119
world to the pci standards

1399
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,839
i cannot allow them to be able to say i

1400
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,200
didn't know

1401
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,920
because i can't i can't that's not an

1402
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,040
excuse that people should have so

1403
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,880
mastercard i mean i

1404
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,599
i supply that data to every merchant to

1405
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,359
touch the mastercard because i want

1406
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,359
people to know their posture and it's

1407
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,400
not perfect

1408
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,040
and the industry has a long way to go

1409
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,119
but yeah i think i feel a deep

1410
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,760
obligation to inform people so as as

1411
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,680
chester says they can make

1412
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,160
a better decision or i can say you had

1413
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,520
all the information you needed to make a

1414
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
good decision you chose to ignore it you

1415
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,400
accepted deliberately accepted risk

1416
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,760
that's the thing that really worries me

1417
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,520
is as i think we've all said

1418
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,920
accidentally or unknowingly having risk

1419
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,800
is

1420
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,119
is a huge problem in cyber security like

1421
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,720
i just didn't know i had that server i

1422
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
didn't know i had that connection i

1423
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,160
didn't know i had unpatched you know

1424
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,000
microsoft exchange servers on on the

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,160
internet those questions could be easily

1426
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,920
answered with technology whereas so many

1427
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
cyber security questions cannot be dealt

1428
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,319
with technology so they clear out the

1429
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,119
chat

1430
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,520
educate everyone make good decisions

1431
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,640
and

1432
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,720
next we need consequences of

1433
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,880
deliberately choosing to have a high

1434
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,720
level of risk

1435
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,839
that affects society

1436
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,160
yeah yeah and i i think the comment that

1437
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,680
several of you made here

1438
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
is we we don't do a good job collecting

1439
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,520
the data so certainly insurance

1440
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
companies could be part of this

1441
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,359
but they also don't have the data i've

1442
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,359
talked to several underwriters and

1443
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,440
a lot of their premium

1444
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
valuation is

1445
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,119
simply a guess

1446
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,800
because they don't have sufficient

1447
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,880
information to really titrate the risk

1448
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,880
appropriately

1449
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,440
so this ties into a question actually

1450
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
two questions that are in the q a of

1451
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,520
sorts and particularly when we're

1452
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,040
talking about small and medium-sized

1453
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,599
organizations

1454
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,599
what we hear from them is

1455
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,520
they don't know what they should be

1456
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,760
doing or what they should be looking at

1457
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,599
and if they're trying to get into this

1458
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,680
they may not be able to hire

1459
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,559
a purdue grad who can help them uh

1460
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,079
they're looking at all of these

1461
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,839
competing standards right there's the

1462
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,480
cis high trust nist itil

1463
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,520
there are all of these different

1464
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,280
standards that are out there

1465
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,160
um

1466
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,280
and

1467
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,960
many of those

1468
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,839
have hundreds or more

1469
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,440
things that they're supposed to look at

1470
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,920
and that's just totally overwhelming

1471
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,839
rather

1472
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,119
than and then if they look at a top 10

1473
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:31,920
list

1474
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
that may not be well suited for their

1475
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,319
industry or for their organization

1476
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,119
so how do we address that how do we

1477
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,760
combine both the transparency

1478
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,960
aspect but

1479
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,280
the in for information about what they

1480
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
should be doing to protect themselves

1481
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,240
and um you know we've got two companies

1482
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,520
here that market uh security software

1483
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,400
that

1484
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,240
is designed to help organizations

1485
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,720
protect their their systems so more

1486
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,240
generally than just

1487
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,599
deploying the right tools or even

1488
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,599
knowing what tools to deploy how do we

1489
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,400
go about doing this

1490
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,680
well it's a great in the u.s there's

1491
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,960
some great government initiatives for

1492
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,400
small business there's some great you

1493
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,480
know the gta toolkits there's really

1494
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,400
good resources that could try and

1495
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,760
simplify

1496
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,640
um

1497
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,319
to promote myself mastercard has the

1498
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,760
trust center which is designed to

1499
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,520
educate small business on cyber security

1500
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,640
it's designed to be a place where they

1501
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,920
can get tools

1502
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,960
it starts with education um

1503
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,720
you know there are certain organizations

1504
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,800
that have a

1505
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,240
have them have

1506
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,000
the voice of the small businesses and

1507
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,520
have an opportunity to help them

1508
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,280
understand the space better

1509
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,440
and guide them towards you know so sofas

1510
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,280
and tennible and the vendor space and

1511
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
say these are the people who solve these

1512
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
particular aspects of the problem and

1513
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,760
this is this is where you engage them

1514
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,200
and this is where you don't like if

1515
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,599
you're two guys in a food cart tenable

1516
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,000
is probably not the right choice for you

1517
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,319
if you're 20 people growing rapidly and

1518
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,599
you have a you know huge estate of

1519
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,119
technology tenable is exactly the kind

1520
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,160
of person

1521
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,359
um it's i think it starts with

1522
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,960
people who have the ability and the

1523
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,640
right to educate small businesses and

1524
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,119
that connection um

1525
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,720
and then there's a whole vendorscape to

1526
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
help them solve the problem

1527
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,240
well yeah there's a bit of a flowchart

1528
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,520
here right i mean the first thing is you

1529
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,040
got to decide if you're enough of a

1530
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,960
scale or in an industry that has the

1531
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
the budget allocation to do it yourself

1532
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,800
or whether you need to pull in with

1533
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,559
other organizations because you're too

1534
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,760
small to be able to handle it on your

1535
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,000
own right and you know there's so many

1536
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,960
um

1537
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,800
uh companies around

1538
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
vancouver here where i am now where

1539
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,440
there's lots of small little tech

1540
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
companies and they actually do security

1541
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,280
in-house because they're in tech they've

1542
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,720
got smart people that understand the

1543
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,960
risks and as a result they're willing to

1544
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,240
you know take it on themselves even

1545
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,079
though they may be 25 30 person

1546
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,760
companies but then

1547
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,800
other

1548
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
organizations those size you know just

1549
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,040
don't have uh the resources to do it

1550
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,319
themselves and i think that's what's

1551
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,319
interesting about uh there's all these

1552
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,599
fractional ciso services right or uh

1553
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,000
this this type of a concept right

1554
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,520
somebody who comes in and does that

1555
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,720
stuff

1556
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,559
a day a month in your business and

1557
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,880
spreads the cost across a whole bunch of

1558
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,240
businesses to provide them with that

1559
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,000
advice help you assess risk along the

1560
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,079
way help you make good decisions maybe

1561
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,079
your internal i.t people can do most of

1562
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:16,800
the

1563
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,960
the the actual labor of of deploying

1564
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,839
software or monitoring software or or or

1565
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,319
watching for alerts or even uh obviously

1566
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,000
managed security service providers as

1567
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,960
well

1568
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,960
you know provide that plus including

1569
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,720
some monitoring and actually taking care

1570
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,240
of acknowledging those alerts and

1571
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,680
letting you know about the ones that are

1572
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,119
critical as opposed to ones that are

1573
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,400
just noise and

1574
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,160
you know i think there's many different

1575
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,079
steps along that path but at the lower

1576
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,040
end

1577
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,400
i don't think it ever even gets to the

1578
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,680
framework stage right when you're

1579
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,800
talking

1580
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
organizations under 100 under 250 people

1581
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,680
unless you're in a regulated industry

1582
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,200
you're generally going to be looking to

1583
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,440
third parties to provide you that advice

1584
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,800
because you simply don't have the budget

1585
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,200
to hire that purdue grad perhaps

1586
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,280
and

1587
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,119
you know i think that's before you even

1588
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,640
get to the determining if you're going

1589
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,480
to look at nist or itil or you know

1590
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,680
things like that which the bigger

1591
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,200
organizations obviously do once they

1592
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,119
start having to be audited or think

1593
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,000
consider going public

1594
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,680
yeah i i agree we'll take a purdue grad

1595
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,040
uh this week we'll take a purdue

1596
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,800
football player over anything uh given

1597
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,760
give last week's performance um i i you

1598
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,400
know

1599
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,000
listen there's certainly the expertise

1600
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
factor there's the cost factor

1601
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,880
uh there's a lot that goes into this

1602
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,559
calculus about what you're going to do

1603
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,680
what you're going to turn to service

1604
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,040
providers whether you're going to share

1605
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
costs and and

1606
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,480
this is something that you know even

1607
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,720
government agencies uh in the us have

1608
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,880
done and said hey listen for internet

1609
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
access we used to have

1610
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,839
thousands of them we're going to

1611
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,599
consolidate we're going to go through

1612
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,520
major departments agencies service

1613
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,359
people that can act as service trusted

1614
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,760
internet connection service providers

1615
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,839
and the same is true of over

1616
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,480
diagnostics and monitoring uh

1617
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,280
programs for for assessing

1618
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
uh security but you know when i'm going

1619
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,800
through a hiring decision when we're

1620
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,559
going through a hiring decision

1621
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,920
you know the one thing that stands out

1622
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,559
between those that are successful

1623
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,680
in the commercial side of cyber security

1624
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,400
and those that aren't is

1625
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,599
a

1626
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,880
level of intellectual curiosity in the

1627
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
field uh if you're interviewing a

1628
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,720
candidate you know they could have

1629
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,000
credentials they could have this they

1630
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,960
could have that and some of those are

1631
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,040
fantastic and some of those you know law

1632
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,640
of averages some of them just turn out

1633
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,400
to not uh be what you were expecting

1634
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,160
but almost always if you're hiring

1635
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,960
someone who loves this stuff

1636
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,880
someone who's got a lab at home someone

1637
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,640
who's playing with systems someone who's

1638
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,480
downloading and testing exploits or

1639
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
trying to detect problems or doing

1640
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
conducting research on their own

1641
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,119
that makes the difference of whether or

1642
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,640
not someone's going to be successful so

1643
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,160
what i would say is

1644
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,559
even more than cost

1645
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,799
the important thing in cyber security is

1646
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,799
giving a damn

1647
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,680
if somebody cares there's enough there

1648
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,520
are enough free tools out there there

1649
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,799
are enough

1650
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,280
professionals willing to mentor there

1651
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,559
are enough

1652
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,040
uh you know low-cost providers but it's

1653
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
more typically just

1654
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,119
it's viewed as a pain and

1655
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,839
or attacks and somebody doesn't care

1656
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,200
whereas you know you've got some

1657
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,559
organizations where the leadership

1658
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,559
stands up and says you know what this is

1659
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,640
culturally important to us

1660
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,640
and we're going to take this seriously

1661
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,799
and even without incurring significant

1662
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,559
costs just tightening down how they

1663
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,200
behave makes a world of difference so i

1664
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,640
you know to me it's

1665
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,040
i don't say it's culture first and then

1666
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,960
budget and technologies and all that

1667
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,280
stuff come you know feeds off of it but

1668
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,760
it all boils down to the culture

1669
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,520
companies that try have better outcomes

1670
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,960
every time

1671
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,440
exactly

1672
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,440
well that's a an interesting uh and a

1673
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,960
point and i don't disagree at all

1674
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,040
because i see that with our students

1675
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,599
is the ones who are just there

1676
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,280
to put in the time

1677
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,839
are certainly not as good at this as the

1678
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,200
ones who are really interested in the

1679
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
material

1680
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,160
but

1681
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,640
we also have an incredible

1682
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,240
pipeline issue and a talent issue

1683
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,720
and it's not unique to just the u.s

1684
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,118
again this is a global phenomenon

1685
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,079
and find those individuals who are

1686
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,280
interested in and curious

1687
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,839
and trying to convince them that

1688
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,200
some of this

1689
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,880
is really interesting

1690
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,040
and that's a better career potentially

1691
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,960
than

1692
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,040
machine learning or blockchain

1693
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,119
is to actually work in real security

1694
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,359
how do we go about doing that how do we

1695
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
incentivize that

1696
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,520
do you have any insights i would be

1697
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,640
interested in that as an educator

1698
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,280
i think those that you know the the and

1699
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,720
i'll

1700
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,760
jump in

1701
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,359
until somebody else is right i think you

1702
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,359
know the the two pieces i would offer or

1703
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,720
that

1704
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,400
you know one is avoided as much as

1705
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
possible meaning

1706
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,319
cyber is one of those fields which is

1707
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,960
painful because it's asymmetric

1708
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,799
and the flip side is

1709
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,920
we can

1710
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,559
we can use the asymmetry in our favor

1711
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,440
too

1712
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,400
which means

1713
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,559
if you're designing the processes

1714
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,160
correctly if you're leveraging the

1715
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,000
expertise correctly

1716
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,280
if you're leveraging the right

1717
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,839
technologies correctly

1718
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,240
there are ways to drive terrific

1719
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,000
asymmetry with the talent that you do

1720
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,040
have and i think that has to be

1721
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,799
top top of the agenda

1722
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,559
uh you know the other is is some of the

1723
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,240
global issues that we were talking about

1724
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,160
earlier right there's tremendous pockets

1725
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,880
of

1726
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,839
of expertise that exist globally around

1727
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,480
cyber security

1728
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,559
that we aren't taking advantage of and

1729
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,559
so it becomes a very a much easier path

1730
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,480
for them to seek out nefarious

1731
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,559
activities and get a return on time that

1732
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,640
way than it is for them to you know to

1733
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,480
earn a living

1734
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,040
delivering cyber security expertise and

1735
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,200
capability and i know there's political

1736
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,880
and geographic challenges there but

1737
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,799
there's there's a lot of talent that

1738
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,040
exists or could be cultivated that we're

1739
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,200
failing to do as as a society i think

1740
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,839
there's there's a that's an untapped uh

1741
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,240
opportunity

1742
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,280
i would think

1743
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,960
we'll go ahead go ahead jess oh thank

1744
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,599
you uh i would say that i've found in

1745
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,760
the last 10 years there's

1746
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,680
equal space in the industry for people

1747
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,280
who know how to break stuff like the

1748
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,920
hackers the reverse engineers people who

1749
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,000
look deeply in the technology

1750
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,400
and the people who understand business

1751
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,280
and business mitigation

1752
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,200
and i'll give you a really simple

1753
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,280
example you can solve every microsoft

1754
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,599
windows virus problem by giving somebody

1755
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,880
an ipad

1756
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,640
it's all it takes you've eliminated the

1757
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,319
entire attack surface of windows and

1758
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,640
that's a business decision

1759
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,480
but that's a decision that somebody with

1760
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,200
a

1761
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,480
knowledge of cyber security and the

1762
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,920
knowledge of risk

1763
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,839
would be able to make without having to

1764
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,760
be a reverse engineer and understand all

1765
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,280
the technical problems

1766
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,839
so sometimes we get really obsessed with

1767
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,760
playing with our food in this industry

1768
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,680
we talk about deception wear and honey

1769
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
pots and tracking and watching the

1770
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,559
criminals and understand their behaviors

1771
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,960
when maybe we should just say just kick

1772
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,440
that i kick them off the network i don't

1773
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,520
do business with russia just block

1774
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,960
everything

1775
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,079
sometimes there are sledgehammer

1776
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,760
approaches which are

1777
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,720
better business decisions um

1778
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,119
so for anyone trying to thinking about a

1779
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,839
career in cyber security

1780
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,599
there are there are at least two tracks

1781
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,079
one is be a deep technical expert and

1782
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,079
one is understand somebody's business

1783
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,000
and apply the tools of cyber security to

1784
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,319
their business problem be equally

1785
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,440
valuable equally valid um if anything i

1786
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,960
struggle to find people who understand

1787
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,119
my business more than i struggle to find

1788
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,119
people who understand the technology of

1789
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,839
cyber security

1790
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,960
i was going to say something else but

1791
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,640
simon inspired me to say something i was

1792
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,839
thinking about last night when i was

1793
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,599
like what might we talk about tomorrow

1794
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,119
in the chat

1795
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,599
and and that was that we're missing this

1796
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,520
huge social element and all the aspects

1797
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,160
of cyber security right like it it it

1798
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,640
amazes me the that we

1799
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,000
think that well we'll just turn

1800
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,440
multi-factor authentication on

1801
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,200
everywhere and that'll be fine not

1802
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,359
understanding that for some people

1803
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,640
they don't understand this stuff they

1804
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,799
don't know how it works or it's not

1805
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,359
necessary for it shouldn't be necessary

1806
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,680
necessarily for the janitor to use

1807
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,839
multi-factor authentication to open his

1808
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,520
laptop to order some more bleach for the

1809
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,400
washrooms that that's maybe an excessive

1810
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,440
control for that situation right um we

1811
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,680
we try to apply things ubiquitously as

1812
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,920
if everything is an equally valued asset

1813
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,520
and and there's a there's kind of this

1814
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,839
social element that's missing of um uh

1815
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:00,720
making

1816
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,760
policies realistic and uh only making

1817
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,280
them challenging where they need to be

1818
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,760
and not everywhere and um i think we're

1819
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,960
getting better at that i think with

1820
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,640
things like zero trust but but i guess

1821
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,240
spaff's question was around bringing

1822
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,680
people in and i think

1823
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,280
that's part of the diversity that's

1824
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,880
missing that can make this a more

1825
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,240
appealing career for people is

1826
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,839
understanding that there's

1827
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,760
business problems to be solved there's

1828
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,680
technical problems to be solved and we

1829
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,520
need people that can socially translate

1830
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,839
these things into practical applicable

1831
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,520
policies that will be both enforceable

1832
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,000
and able to be followed by our staff

1833
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
members to truly because anything we put

1834
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
in place that's not socially acceptable

1835
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,079
will be bypassed and then we've

1836
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,359
accomplished nothing we've just had

1837
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,880
people go around the policy and do

1838
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,680
something

1839
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,079
uh outside of it uh to to accomplish it

1840
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,359
right so i mean i i

1841
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,520
when i talk to rapid responders

1842
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,280
more and more often

1843
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,440
it's well they had a policy in place but

1844
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,880
the criminals got in the place where the

1845
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,640
policy was bypassed

1846
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,599
and and that um

1847
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,359
is back to i guess what simon says it's

1848
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,559
not simply

1849
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,000
being reverse engineers and things we

1850
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,720
need to open our space up to

1851
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,160
people in social sciences and other

1852
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,000
things to help us do these jobs better

1853
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,359
and communicate better to the people

1854
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,520
that we need to to participate in these

1855
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,920
programs

1856
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,599
i'll i'll mention that uh we've had this

1857
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,359
interdisciplinary graduate program for

1858
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,559
20 years

1859
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,799
uh and really the basic idea behind

1860
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,280
sirius is multi-disciplinary rather than

1861
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,160
just the technical uh some of our

1862
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,200
most

1863
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,559
um

1864
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,240
successful grads

1865
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,359
came in

1866
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,359
with background in

1867
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,319
um

1868
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,280
in art philosophy journalism

1869
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,599
and then added these other skills on top

1870
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,039
and they don't look at problems the same

1871
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,400
way

1872
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,160
so i think what i'm hearing from all of

1873
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,760
you is that that's that needs to be

1874
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,559
cultivated better i think across

1875
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,640
uh our educational institutions and our

1876
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,319
hiring processes

1877
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,839
that if someone doesn't have a degree in

1878
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,440
computer science that doesn't mean

1879
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,119
they're not qualified and not everybody

1880
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,799
recognizes that

1881
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,319
absolutely

1882
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,359
which

1883
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,119
which gets to

1884
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,720
another one of the questions that's here

1885
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,480
in the in the q a

1886
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,359
where someone said that they're finding

1887
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,880
is what we're finding and i think this

1888
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,839
is true many people that i've talked to

1889
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,839
is that large companies are really

1890
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,680
intent on shoving square pegs into round

1891
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,240
holes and this can include requiring

1892
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,880
people to have a cissp for instance or

1893
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,400
requiring them to have 10 years

1894
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,319
experience with products that have only

1895
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,559
been out five years uh before they'll

1896
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,079
hire them

1897
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,760
and the comment here is interesting that

1898
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,280
customers will step over a dollar to

1899
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,559
pick up a dime simply because they're

1900
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,720
unaware of what's important

1901
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,400
and and this is partly a byproduct of

1902
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,240
many of the companies

1903
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,240
both for the products and

1904
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
actually for some of the add-on security

1905
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,280
products

1906
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,079
uh

1907
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,559
marketing what they have

1908
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,400
rather than actually

1909
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,359
marketing to the solution space

1910
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,240
is there a better way that

1911
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,319
i i think we've addressed this in some

1912
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,440
other ways

1913
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,960
but

1914
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,440
do you have comments on on

1915
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,520
what are ways that we can try to change

1916
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,319
this

1917
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,039
to you to get companies to be more aware

1918
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,640
of what they should be looking for that

1919
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,359
curious individual that individual that

1920
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,319
that

1921
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,200
is is willing to go the extra mile

1922
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,400
comments

1923
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,119
i would start by

1924
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,760
i try and remind all the companies i

1925
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,319
work with that that your level of cyber

1926
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,200
security hygiene or professionalism

1927
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,520
isn't a competitive advantage

1928
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,240
in that you should not be trying to be

1929
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,920
you should not see somebody else's

1930
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,400
weakness as a benefit to you like our

1931
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,880
adverse our advocacy is the same we are

1932
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,599
all fighting the same criminals so

1933
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,200
for every company thinking about how do

1934
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,880
i develop this cyber security practice

1935
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,640
how do i do this

1936
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,400
you should be able to talk to your peers

1937
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,680
in the industry

1938
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,520
you know the the banking system is

1939
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,559
perhaps

1940
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,480
an unusual in that all the csos in the

1941
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,440
banking system share freely what's going

1942
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,680
on the threats which the threats the

1943
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,839
problems the solutions we like the ones

1944
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,280
that don't work

1945
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,920
but but there should be everybody in a

1946
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,280
leadership position in cyber security

1947
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,200
should feel that they can reach out and

1948
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,680
share with peers in the industry and get

1949
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,680
good advice because we're all fighting

1950
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,359
the same enemy here

1951
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,960
and i don't think anyone should glory in

1952
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,640
one of their competitors being hit by

1953
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,720
cyber attack that should be seen as

1954
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,520
devastating to all of us if anyone is

1955
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,319
attacked successfully we should all feel

1956
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,079
empathy for those people

1957
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,400
so i think that's where it starts is ask

1958
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,599
other people what you're doing how

1959
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,119
you're solving the problems learn from

1960
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,039
each other and maybe those strange

1961
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,960
requirements as you say for 15 years

1962
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,079
experience on the package that was

1963
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,720
developed 10 years ago will slowly

1964
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,799
evaporate

1965
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,240
well do you think so

1966
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,319
oh sorry smith i i was just going to say

1967
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,160
do you think the banking

1968
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,240
industry is that way because it is so

1969
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,640
highly regulated or is there something

1970
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,039
else about about that environment that

1971
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,720
creates that level of communication and

1972
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,079
collegiality

1973
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:08,960
i think

1974
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,079
i highly regulated but we're all solving

1975
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,160
almost exactly the same problems so an

1976
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,079
attack against one of us is likely to

1977
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,079
attack all of us um so we all feel

1978
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,880
equally as vulnerable perhaps

1979
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,839
and

1980
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,880
we

1981
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,559
yeah we don't glory in each other's

1982
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,720
failures um there was a time in the

1983
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,240
cyber security industry in particular

1984
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,520
where

1985
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,520
we gloried in each other's failures i

1986
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,079
think that's dissolving but i think

1987
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,839
people still feel that subsequent is

1988
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,119
something that they shouldn't share they

1989
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,559
shouldn't talk about

1990
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,720
and it needs to be controlled how you

1991
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,720
talk about it needs to be controlled but

1992
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,200
everyone should feel that their peers

1993
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,960
are accessible to them

1994
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,960
or rather i worry when people feel that

1995
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,400
they can't share their subsecurity

1996
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,240
problems with their peers in the

1997
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,280
industry

1998
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,280
it's holding us back

1999
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,039
chad i stepped on your comment there so

2000
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,000
please no and uh just to um to add to

2001
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,839
what simon's saying uh i think this

2002
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,079
education field does a really good job

2003
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,480
of this as well we see tons of k-12

2004
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,839
schools and universities in the united

2005
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,119
states that all talk to one another what

2006
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,400
are you doing about this problem how are

2007
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,079
you solving this problem how did that

2008
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,520
work well not as great as we would have

2009
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,720
liked i would have tried something else

2010
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,200
next time whatever but getting that that

2011
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,280
conversation flowing and um

2012
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,960
i'm fortunate here in vancouver we have

2013
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,240
like three

2014
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,319
different local security groups that

2015
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,160
meet business people meet and you know

2016
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,839
one's kind of more business oriented and

2017
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,920
audit oriented for uh you know white

2018
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,000
collar upper management kind of folks

2019
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,440
one's the hackers getting together

2020
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,000
that's the b sides and defcon crew

2021
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,520
and then there's sort of a middle one

2022
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,839
where you know it's more generic for

2023
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,520
just technology professionals to get

2024
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,280
together and talk about security but

2025
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,440
those groups facilitate more positive

2026
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,280
conversations and improvement security

2027
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,359
of everybody in our community

2028
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,200
than anything else it always amazes me

2029
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,400
when i bump into somebody they say they

2030
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,079
work in i.t security at some company in

2031
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,359
town and i've never seen him at any of

2032
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,960
these meetings because i'm like you're

2033
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,960
an island like how can you survive on

2034
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,880
your own right like we're we're all

2035
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,319
feeding off of one another and learning

2036
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,559
from one another and all of us find it

2037
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,319
so invaluable that you know we do

2038
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,680
everything we can to participate even

2039
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,119
through a pandemic because it's so

2040
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,960
important to our careers and being able

2041
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,238
to be successful and um and and and too

2042
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,479
often what i see as a vendor is

2043
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,080
customers are looking for a product

2044
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,839
rather than a solution and that's how

2045
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,600
they end up with this round whole square

2046
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,000
peg situation sometimes they're going i

2047
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,359
need to you know in the old days it was

2048
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,040
i need to buy antivirus right so i'm

2049
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,399
going to put a

2050
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,880
thing out rfp out for

2051
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
10 antivirus vendors instead of saying

2052
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,640
i'm looking to protect my endpoints from

2053
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,080
getting attacked because all of them are

2054
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,839
getting compromised right you don't

2055
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,759
necessarily need antivirus you are your

2056
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,359
goal is to stop this thing that's

2057
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,719
happening which is endpoints are being

2058
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,000
compromised and there's lots of

2059
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,198
different ways of approaching that

2060
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,279
problem and in fact you're probably not

2061
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,520
an expert as the purchaser the people in

2062
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,880
the industry are the experts if you

2063
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,399
explain your problem to them you're far

2064
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,920
more likely to get

2065
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,600
solutions that fit the shape of the hole

2066
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,799
better

2067
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,640
rather than going out and saying i need

2068
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,880
to buy a firewall or do you need to buy

2069
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,158
a firewall what is the problem that

2070
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,600
you're trying to solve right tell us

2071
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,120
about your problems come to the experts

2072
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,279
with your problems and those experts can

2073
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,960
then help you find things that will

2074
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,158
solve the problem rather than

2075
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,560
necessarily just meet the description uh

2076
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,920
in an rfp or an rfi

2077
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,279
and and even um you know sort of

2078
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,600
piggyback on on that it's

2079
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,399
these problems are 95 consistent you

2080
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,080
know maybe there's some modest

2081
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,759
differences between this industry's

2082
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,359
requirement and that industry's

2083
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,679
requirement but the best practices

2084
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,920
are the best practices and and

2085
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,000
there's very little confusion i i saw

2086
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,880
one of the the comments in the q a panel

2087
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,120
uh was kind of highlighting the

2088
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,719
you know these different industry

2089
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,479
frameworks of which

2090
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,040
you know there's 80 plus percent overlap

2091
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,960
between whether it's cis benchmarks high

2092
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,960
trust nist you know so so on and so

2093
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,040
forth and and so

2094
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,360
yes i agree staff the marketing is is

2095
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,600
confusing uh and

2096
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,280
i would say shame on the industry and

2097
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,440
the vendor community uh you know trying

2098
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,520
to try to peddle their wares

2099
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,600
but that's that's that's to be extend

2100
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,400
expected the basics are well understood

2101
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,080
uh and

2102
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,920
do that blocking and tackling before you

2103
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,360
try and

2104
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,840
and jump on to some uh

2105
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,080
some some bleeding edge uh bleeding edge

2106
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,679
marketing you know i think you mentioned

2107
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,000
earlier the zero trust well that's

2108
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,159
that's that's now a hot thing but that's

2109
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:30,640
been around for decade decade or decades

2110
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,360
decades with different uh you know under

2111
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,360
under different different monikers so

2112
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,640
yeah these things are evolving the

2113
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,880
industry is evolving and later today i'm

2114
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,080
going to talk about some things that are

2115
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,280
really hey

2116
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,040
where is the world really different but

2117
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,560
a vast majority of what needs to get

2118
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,320
done is well understood do those things

2119
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,719
get the basics right get the basics yeah

2120
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,960
i i'll just say if anybody wants to go

2121
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,719
look it up that if you go back and read

2122
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,880
the saltzer intruder report from the

2123
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,640
1970s

2124
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,080
all those principles

2125
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,840
encompass

2126
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,560
zero trust and more

2127
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,760
and

2128
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,199
70s and we still haven't really

2129
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,960
gotten to learn those

2130
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,560
well i'm going to shift this a little

2131
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,320
bit here because there's a comment a

2132
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,800
question that was made in the in the q a

2133
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,000
that opens another topic area

2134
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,800
um

2135
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,400
we talk about security but it's not the

2136
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,000
only aspect it's a matter of what it is

2137
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,760
we're securing and certainly we're

2138
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,320
securing some things of economic value

2139
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,760
but

2140
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,880
we also have an awful lot of information

2141
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,960
that affects individuals

2142
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,719
and we're trying to protect privacy a

2143
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,600
lot of individuals want security because

2144
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,760
they want it to protect their privacy

2145
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,719
and they lose it in large data breaches

2146
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,719
or other kinds of

2147
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,800
situations

2148
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,520
so is there a mechanism

2149
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,040
gdpr as an example but it it

2150
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,280
should individuals be in

2151
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,120
involved in trying to set some of this

2152
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,760
policy and apply the pressure and if so

2153
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,920
how do how do we do that appropriately

2154
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,960
do you have thoughts on that

2155
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,839
i think

2156
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,440
it's

2157
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,560
yeah the gdpr the frameworks the

2158
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,960
penalties are fine for

2159
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,760
for

2160
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,400
a fine for a negative outcome

2161
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
but everybody who's lost their data

2162
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,159
still lost their data

2163
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,920
um

2164
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,679
it's interesting i was i was at an event

2165
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,280
this week and people were asking me a

2166
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,280
very similar question i was i was saying

2167
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,880
to them you know when when

2168
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,960
when some website asks you for your

2169
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,400
mother's maiden name

2170
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,920
just like

2171
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,520
like they don't need to know the real

2172
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,320
name when it asks for your birthday life

2173
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,199
just use the same random date every time

2174
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,800
so you remember it

2175
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,960
you don't have to give these sites facts

2176
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,880
and and certainly if it's a fact about

2177
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,640
you that can never be changed like your

2178
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,480
mother's main name in your birthday you

2179
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,760
don't want to give it to anyone who

2180
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,440
doesn't really need it

2181
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,440
um the challenge is

2182
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,560
we kind of lost that battle because

2183
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,480
everyone's already given that data away

2184
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,199
to people who didn't need it

2185
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,120
so what do you do you increase the fines

2186
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,719
doesn't stop doesn't stop the problem

2187
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,480
being lost and

2188
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,679
doesn't stop

2189
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,920
stop the problem that hackers now are

2190
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,760
building up this bigger and bigger data

2191
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,159
set of everybody's true data

2192
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,440
so yeah

2193
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,880
maybe we need a regulation that lets

2194
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,239
everyone change their mother's maiden

2195
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,560
name and their birthday legally

2196
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,320
i've seen interesting commentary that

2197
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,640
that this is one reason why the uh

2198
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,760
perhaps the chinese are

2199
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,640
just

2200
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,480
taking everything that isn't tied down

2201
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,320
anything they can find because they're

2202
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,880
building huge databases for their ai to

2203
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,320
work against

2204
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,719
and and that's the real competitive

2205
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,719
advantage

2206
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,960
you see these questions on on social

2207
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,880
media like fun questions like oh take

2208
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,560
the first you know take the name of your

2209
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,120
first school and this street you grew up

2210
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,280
in that's your new superhero name like

2211
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,719
you just gave away two pieces of

2212
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,560
information that every bank site asks to

2213
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,040
log in like

2214
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,920
now

2215
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,080
we as professionals see this and think

2216
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,400
that stupid nobody would fall for that

2217
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,239
but do we do we

2218
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,760
go above and beyond to educate the

2219
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,560
people who don't realize that or stop

2220
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,480
that happening i don't know i mean yes

2221
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,440
you're right

2222
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,199
people are hoovering this information up

2223
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:22,000
and society is willingly giving it away

2224
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,480
and it's uh it's very damaging i don't

2225
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,400
think punitive fines solve the problem

2226
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,640
no the well i mean it's probably not

2227
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,320
news that simon's industry wants to hear

2228
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,840
but like when people talk about worrying

2229
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,120
about their credit card being stolen

2230
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,719
it's like that's the last fear i have on

2231
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,560
earth like i get a new credit card in

2232
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,000
five minutes right i can just call my

2233
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,440
company go cancel the thing i almost

2234
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,199
never am on the hook for any fraud the

2235
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,280
liability protections covered my butt

2236
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,800
and i'm like credit cards are disposable

2237
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,920
that way like i don't care if you steal

2238
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,280
my credit card i'm much more worried

2239
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,480
about my social security number my

2240
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,080
social insurance number my date of birth

2241
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
all these other things that that can

2242
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,520
allow you to buy a boat you don't even

2243
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,760
need to put your real name on it

2244
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,199
exactly and you and you don't need to

2245
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,199
sign it it's like

2246
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,719
it's zero trust you don't even need to

2247
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:03,920
sign the receipts anymore thanks to

2248
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,800
mastercard thank you um but uh

2249
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,679
yeah i mean but the the concern i guess

2250
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,400
is

2251
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,000
it's not just the chinese hoovering up

2252
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,159
the data either right like i i was doing

2253
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,159
some research yesterday on

2254
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,159
these uh initial access brokers that

2255
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,520
stealth you know machines they've

2256
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,880
compromised inside of businesses to

2257
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,800
other criminals to further their crimes

2258
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,480
and stuff and this one initial access

2259
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,480
broker forum i was on was actually also

2260
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,719
selling complete dossiers on people in

2261
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,000
the united states so i could search for

2262
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,920
people by zip code and purchase their

2263
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,520
social security number their place of

2264
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,080
employment their you know home address

2265
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,679
and i could choose which fields you know

2266
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,360
just check boxes in the search thing

2267
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
going i only want you to show me people

2268
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,840
that were born between 1970 and 1980

2269
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,880
that live in new york state that have uh

2270
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
income over 100 000 and it's like okay

2271
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,960
here you go eight dollars a piece right

2272
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,280
um this information's already out there

2273
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,480
so i think

2274
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,719
the idea of protecting it it is too late

2275
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,880
the question is

2276
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,960
how do we pivot away from relying on

2277
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,719
this information that's compromised we

2278
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,400
have to stop using this as a form of

2279
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,880
identity this is not a secret

2280
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,600
absolutely yeah i think that's that's

2281
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,440
the key point you know to your original

2282
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,120
point about privacy

2283
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:13,920
uh

2284
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,800
i would say it's an illusion but yeah

2285
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,360
every generation has less and less

2286
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,400
expectation and less less privacy than

2287
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,800
prior generations so i'm

2288
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,719
purposefully not on facebook whatsapp

2289
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,400
instagram tick tock you know blah blah

2290
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,719
blah blah blah my kids are on all those

2291
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,440
things so my kids are the problem

2292
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,440
uh and it's just getting worse so

2293
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,960
what we have to do is design

2294
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,320
systems

2295
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,199
which account for these types of these

2296
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,159
types of changes yeah i figured simon

2297
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,760
but somebody earlier said well you know

2298
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,760
it all depends on the system

2299
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,560
i should not make my janitor

2300
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,760
uh

2301
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,159
do go through some mfa

2302
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,320
in order to do his or her job because

2303
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,239
it's just too cumbersome too complex too

2304
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,640
costly and so on i think

2305
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,560
what we have to get to is

2306
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,239
the systems which would require or

2307
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,760
facilitate

2308
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,880
all people doing mfa

2309
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
because it's easier and the the

2310
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,800
consumerization is what i'm thinking of

2311
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,440
right i mean there's face id touch ideas

2312
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,120
as examples and they have their problems

2313
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,400
but it is easier to do face id

2314
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,280
than it is to remember a password so

2315
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,520
that becomes the piece the path of of

2316
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,320
least resistance the auto update to to

2317
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,159
the ipad or you know whoever mentioned

2318
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,120
that earlier

2319
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,960
is on by default

2320
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,600
it's easier to be secure and apply the

2321
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,440
updates than it is to

2322
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,120
go through the work around to stop the

2323
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,360
auto update from happening and of course

2324
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,280
there'll be some idiots that do that but

2325
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,120
but for the most part we have to make

2326
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,640
the systems that we rely on

2327
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,400
more conducive to

2328
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,320
better security and if so if the data if

2329
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,159
the information about us the social

2330
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,600
security numbers the driver's license

2331
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,800
the date of birth the mother's maiden

2332
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,560
name if that stuff is out there we just

2333
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,320
have to assume okay that's that's a

2334
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,719
failed component we can't rely on

2335
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,080
something

2336
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,760
you know or

2337
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,600
data you can hopefully recall we've got

2338
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,080
to rely on other mechanisms which are

2339
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,120
more consumer-proof

2340
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,040
your your comments uh

2341
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,800
on this have prompted me

2342
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,719
to recall

2343
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,679
uh

2344
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,040
the idea that

2345
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,920
the panopticon that jeremy bentham uh

2346
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,400
put forth the idea that uh actually that

2347
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,120
was originally for prisons and

2348
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,560
that the amount of information collected

2349
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,640
it would be used basically as a means of

2350
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,600
control of oppression and certainly some

2351
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,440
of the facial recognition that's being

2352
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,719
used now

2353
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,920
uh particularly in western china against

2354
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,400
the uyghurs is an example of where this

2355
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,760
is being used

2356
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,040
as an authoritarian kind of control

2357
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,719
and that's what scares a lot of people i

2358
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,320
think in terms of privacy and

2359
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,719
information collection

2360
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,880
one suggestion that's been put forward

2361
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,520
by i think david brin was the first one

2362
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,000
to talk about at the transparent society

2363
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,400
is that if the information's two-way so

2364
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
if you have transparency and you have

2365
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,159
the same information about the people

2366
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:23,920
who are collecting it on you

2367
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,760
that's a defense

2368
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,239
so maybe we need less protection

2369
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,080
uh as a solution

2370
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,880
uh to make more information available

2371
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,159
uh i i i personally i love that i sort

2372
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,080
of wonder if the

2373
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,880
if there's a greater societal

2374
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,239
swing which will occur if everything

2375
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,159
that our generation thinks is

2376
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,520
embarrassing

2377
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,080
is already out there about you right the

2378
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,320
all you're stupid dancing on a bar doing

2379
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,000
your whatever it is you you did in your

2380
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,120
20s

2381
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,480
is already out there the video's there

2382
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,440
people

2383
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,280
it's a little bit different because

2384
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,520
everybody's embarrassing moments are out

2385
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,120
there things that i would never disclose

2386
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,159
about myself because i find them

2387
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,920
embarrassing my kids are out there out

2388
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,760
there talking about so so i'm wondering

2389
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,520
if this this

2390
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,320
uh

2391
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,960
this level of transparency swings to a

2392
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,840
much more radically liberal society

2393
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,440
uh people aren't as sensitive about

2394
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,719
their

2395
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,480
the things that that you or i might be

2396
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,040
embarrassed about

2397
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,440
yeah um although i i've been i've been

2398
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,120
continuing to do those things i didn't

2399
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,480
just like them

2400
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,840
well i noticed as you were talking about

2401
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,360
embarrassing things simon turned off his

2402
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,880
camera for a moment um

2403
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,520
i i

2404
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,960
i think there's some fertile ground

2405
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,360
there to talk further about privacy but

2406
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,760
um in the interest of time

2407
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,600
uh

2408
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,360
what i'd like to do here is we're as

2409
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,120
we're getting closer to the end of our

2410
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,719
time

2411
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,239
we've touched on a lot of different

2412
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,280
things

2413
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,199
and each of you have

2414
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,360
a different but

2415
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,679
complimentary view of a lot of what's

2416
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,120
going on

2417
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,199
um i think our audience would be

2418
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,840
interested in hearing

2419
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,840
what each of you think

2420
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,600
is a

2421
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,920
high priority one or two things that we

2422
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,520
should focus on

2423
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,800
and

2424
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
what are what are the obstacles to

2425
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,560
accomplishing them

2426
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
now i realize that's a a big

2427
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,040
ask uh but we have all these challenges

2428
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,600
we have uh hacking we have pipeline

2429
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,360
problems we have privacy problems

2430
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,320
government regulation uh issues uh

2431
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,960
issues ransomware uh we haven't even

2432
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,760
talked about the looming threat of

2433
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,040
um

2434
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,280
quantum uh potentially of uh rogue ai

2435
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,199
systems i mean there's a whole lot of

2436
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,800
other things that we could easily fit in

2437
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,920
if we had

2438
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
at least another hour but i would be

2439
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,000
interested in

2440
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,679
from from each of you

2441
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,000
uh your own personal

2442
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,480
top one or two things that you think are

2443
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,880
really critical for us to make progress

2444
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,400
and what do you think the biggest

2445
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,880
obstacles to those are

2446
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,159
and

2447
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,760
if one of you wants to volunteer to go

2448
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,840
first great otherwise i'll flip a

2449
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,000
three-sided point

2450
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,440
so let me kick off

2451
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,080
passive stuffing fishing and patching

2452
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,520
the fundamentals

2453
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,679
and if you have any

2454
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,159
cyber security awareness at all make it

2455
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,480
your mission to pay it forward to train

2456
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,639
and teach other people

2457
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,960
if we evolve society to have a better

2458
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,199
understanding of cyber security then

2459
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,520
everything else will go much smoother so

2460
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,639
fishing patching stuffing

2461
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,560
okay

2462
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,280
i'm going to revisit something we said a

2463
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,840
few questions ago but um

2464
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,800
try

2465
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,480
right you have to try figure out

2466
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,080
identify what's important to you and try

2467
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,840
and it doesn't matter if you're an

2468
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,360
individual back to how we all feel

2469
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,280
differently about privacy whether our

2470
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,719
tick tock moments should be public or

2471
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:01,600
not

2472
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,560
um

2473
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,880
that's that's fine right but make a

2474
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,639
conscious decision don't don't let the

2475
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:07,679
accident

2476
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:08,400
of

2477
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,080
information that you disclosed come back

2478
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,159
to hurt you because you didn't know

2479
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,920
think about it decide how open you want

2480
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,080
to be and then enjoy facebook or

2481
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,159
whatever it is that you're using but but

2482
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,520
make a choice and businesses in

2483
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,760
particular need to identify you know

2484
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,080
what their risks are and what they truly

2485
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,159
need to protect and then try to protect

2486
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,639
those assets and and more um more often

2487
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,360
than not we're seeing almost any victim

2488
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,560
that's trying even if they're

2489
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,400
compromised is able to

2490
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,840
to boot the criminals out of their

2491
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
network and ultimately protect their

2492
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,560
information more times than not and

2493
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,000
almost all the organizations that are

2494
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,920
suffering complete failure have not

2495
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,920
tried and we're not doing any of those

2496
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,520
basics and so those basics are the ones

2497
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,400
of course that simon mentioned but like

2498
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,159
if you're trying hard and you've got and

2499
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:53,280
you've made it clear that it's a

2500
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,679
priority for you as a person or you as

2501
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,280
your business and your organization and

2502
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,199
you have people on board you're going to

2503
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,440
have better outcomes and

2504
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,040
unless you're against

2505
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,880
incredibly sophisticated adversaries

2506
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,520
which the vast majority of us are not

2507
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,320
um you're simply trying is generally

2508
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,760
enough to keep you safe compared to

2509
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,239
everyone else and you know the the

2510
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,840
ransomware and all this other stuff is a

2511
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,159
low-hanging fruit game in in

2512
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,440
in large part

2513
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,800
and um

2514
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,960
i'm just seeing that you know we we saw

2515
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,560
that uh approximately 37 of the

2516
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,080
people we surveyed last year were hit by

2517
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,679
ransomware but

2518
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,000
but 47 of them didn't have their files

2519
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,239
encrypted right so over half of the

2520
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,920
almost half of them now were able to

2521
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,480
successfully defend themselves simply by

2522
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,400
monitoring their network monitoring for

2523
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,320
compromise detecting the compromise and

2524
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,679
then doing something when they saw it

2525
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,280
rather than ignoring it as another alert

2526
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,560
that just popped up in their console

2527
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,199
kind of thing so i think that that's

2528
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,960
encouraging that more organizations are

2529
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,520
doing it but 47 is not enough we need to

2530
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,600
get that closer to 100 and if you're

2531
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,560
trying i think you'll do well

2532
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,120
right i guess uh i guess i'm up

2533
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,480
the greatest opportunity i'd probably

2534
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,480
agree with chester you know he put it as

2535
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,560
as trying or something like that you

2536
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,400
know i would say i'd use the words

2537
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,080
transparency and accountability which

2538
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,000
ultimately our way of forcing people to

2539
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,320
try

2540
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,760
just simply driving transparency and

2541
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,360
accountability will change behavior

2542
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,440
adherence to best practices minimum

2543
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,920
standards uh you know standards of care

2544
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,600
avoiding negligence but however you

2545
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,719
characterize it driving transparency uh

2546
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,199
and accountability are the are the

2547
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,960
greatest opportunity for near-term

2548
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,520
progress in cyber in my opinion

2549
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,159
uh greatest challenge

2550
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,600
i'd say is probably this concept of of

2551
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,000
abstraction um

2552
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,440
you know we're used to saying oh i'm

2553
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,120
doing this on my computer i mean on your

2554
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,880
computer you do

2555
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,960
almost if not absolutely nothing you

2556
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,560
move a mouse you click something you

2557
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,840
press a key you hope for the best

2558
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,320
but in today's environment we're so far

2559
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,639
abstracted as users or even

2560
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,679
those designing systems from what is

2561
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,239
actually happening under the hood

2562
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,080
that there is a near infinite uh attack

2563
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,960
surface which is which is forming so

2564
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,639
it's almost impossible to identify

2565
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,639
what's hardware what's firmware what's

2566
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,639
an operating system

2567
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:25,440
what are applications what networks what

2568
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,960
clouds you're on

2569
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,440
where the data's resides whose data that

2570
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,320
is

2571
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,480
through where it traverses

2572
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,040
and this combination and and then the

2573
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,880
inability to abstract between what is

2574
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,960
data and what is executable i mean all

2575
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,120
these things and and executables and

2576
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,960
decisions are being made on the data

2577
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,440
just the the complexity of what compute

2578
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,360
is starting to look like

2579
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,800
uh is so far removed from our ability to

2580
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,320
to uh

2581
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,159
to digest it that

2582
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:54,960
uh

2583
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,719
it's just an area where i think there's

2584
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,960
there's tremendous uh you know work that

2585
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,679
needs to get done

2586
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,679
i i think uh if i may

2587
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,719
what i heard you all say here

2588
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,920
is we need to have a greater awareness

2589
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,719
and commitment of everyone to the

2590
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:15,679
problem

2591
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:16,800
rather than

2592
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,639
thinking that it is a domain of

2593
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,719
specialists only

2594
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,000
and that we need to be much better about

2595
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,760
being open about

2596
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,400
where the successes and failures are as

2597
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,960
we all address those

2598
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,480
is problems

2599
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,480
is that

2600
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,400
do any of you feel that what you said

2601
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,280
wasn't encompassed by that

2602
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,480
spot on

2603
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,280
okay

2604
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,719
well i think that's a great thing as a

2605
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:41,920
takeaway

2606
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,159
and it's not the only one from this

2607
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,199
panel um it has been

2608
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,400
a just a delight to be able to talk to

2609
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,880
all three of you in this in this format

2610
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,880
uh hear your insights i've spoken with

2611
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,440
each of you individually in the past and

2612
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,840
that's always educational

2613
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,440
i'm looking forward

2614
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,600
to at least a part of the panel later

2615
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,920
this afternoon and the keynote closing

2616
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,880
keynote

2617
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,320
unfortunately during the panel later

2618
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,639
this afternoon i'm teaching a class on

2619
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,120
security and so i'm going to have to

2620
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,800
miss part of the panel

2621
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,080
but we are all very grateful for you

2622
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,600
spending the time and lending your

2623
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,960
expertise

2624
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,280
not only at this but with what you do on

2625
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,840
a regular basis and i thank all of you
