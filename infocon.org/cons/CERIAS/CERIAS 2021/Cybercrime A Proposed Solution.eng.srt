screen okay still

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,240
yes yes excellent well thank i'm very

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
excited to be here because i

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
i know so many uh just

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
uh incredible things about the security

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,159
program that you have at purdue

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,600
and i really wanted to come up last year

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,880
to give this talk um

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
partly because i wanted to come to

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,399
campus and meet people there

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
and also partly because my son went to

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
purdue so

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
an act but things have changed so he

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,600
graduated so

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
that's not going to work and also the

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
whole pandemic delayed the whole

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
trip and stuff like that but i know

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,719
you've had

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,440
many many brilliant speakers over the

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
years so i kind of feel

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
pretty odd just to even be part of this

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
program

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,920
so as um professor selik said so i am

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
currently in academia i'm the director

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,400
of the cyber security master's degree

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
program at quinnipiac we're a

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
mid-sized school in hampden connecticut

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
and this program is all online it's

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,319
really focused around

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,760
security defense so i i over the past

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
couple years i've started thinking more

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
and more about security defense

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
and we have some uh some things that are

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
uh interesting here i i interview people

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,640
pretty regularly on what's going on in

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,560
the security job market and you can go

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
there and take a look at that if you

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
like

73
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
but i feel a little bit like i'm

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,280
bringing

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
kohl's to newcastle because we're a you

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,440
know we're a teaching university we're

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
not like you guys are a

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
tier one research university but i

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
kind of looked up what does it mean

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,959
bringing kohl's to newcastle so it goes

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,440
back

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,400
a few centuries newcastle england was a

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,800
big

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
center of coal mining

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
so bringing calls to newcastle sounds

86
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
ridiculous but this one american

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,480
entrepreneur back in the 19th century

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
did bring

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
he sailed to newcastle and brought in a

90
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,319
whole boatload of coal

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
and actually made a lot of money selling

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
it because

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
there was a minor strike going on at the

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
time so

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
this is i'm kind of throwing out some

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040
ideas here if anybody wants to kind of

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
collaborate in any way just

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,159
drop me an email or connect with me on

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
linkedin and oh by the way i saw that

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,879
newcastle

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,720
australia is now the biggest uh

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
exporter of coal in the world so kind of

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,239
a

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,680
fact you didn't really want to know but

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,319
anyway so this is about

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,439
cyber crime analysis why

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
why do you want to how can you benefit

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
from doing

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
analysis of crimes and so

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
i took i'm taking the point of view that

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,918
you're a defender

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,880
you're in a small medium or large-sized

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
enterprise

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
how do you build out an effective

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
defense in today's

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,199
very complex security environment so it

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,080
seems to me

118
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,600
what i'm really recommending in this

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,280
presentation

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
is more analysis of

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
actual events and cyber crime

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,639
and the objective is to really improve

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,680
our collective and

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
individual defenses so i

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
created this slide maybe a year ago

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,720
security uh

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
is still a huge problem this actually

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
goes back to cyber security awareness

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,000
month from

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
last year so i had some information on

131
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
cyber crime losses

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,520
2018 mcafee says 600 billion

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
so i did update it today so now mcafee

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
is estimating one trillion worldwide

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,639
losses

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
and then covid fraud losses we've all

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,039
heard about those

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,440
last year i think the ftc estimated 152

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
million

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
now i just checked today it's 380

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
million so

142
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,360
we're all we all know about the sort of

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
global and

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
uh nature of the cyber crime problem

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
and here's another graph you may not

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
have seen so i'm a member of a group

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,639
called

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,600
sim the society for information

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
management it's a u.s based

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
organization there's about 40 chapters

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
around the country

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
and the members are it's not a security

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
organization i joined like 25 years ago

154
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
because i wanted to understand

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
what our chief information security

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
officers and directors of security what

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,319
are they

158
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,440
i mean directors of i.t what are they

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
thinking about

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
technology and security in particular so

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
this is an interesting graph or table

162
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
here this shows

163
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
as of their survey which kind of just

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,280
came out at the end of

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
the beginning of 2021 the top

166
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
management issues in organizations

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
as of last year and actually the last 10

168
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
years so it's kind of interesting to see

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
so in 2010 cyber security was only the

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
number nine

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
most top you know of the top ten it was

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
at the bottom right does everybody

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
you guys may not i've been allowed

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
around long enough to remember

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
in 2010 if you were a security

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,600
professional you had to say well

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
i know security is important for the

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
organization but i also know there's

179
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
eight or nine other things that are more

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,479
important that was that was kind of the

181
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,800
the uh mindset you had to have you

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
couldn't say it was top of mind and now

183
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
look what's happened 2019

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
2020 for the last four years security is

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
top of mind in i.t executives remember

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
these are

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
chief and chief information officers not

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
chief information security officers so

189
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
we have to take advantage of this and

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
this is another graph

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
i put this in it has nothing to do with

192
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,599
the talk

193
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,000
but i've been tracking the number of

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
cloud jobs on indeed.com

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
since 2012 i started looking at that

196
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
there were 25 000 jobs and back in those

197
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
days

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
security was one of the biggest

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
issues people said well we can't put

200
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
applications or data and the cloud is

201
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
not secure

202
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
and so that's what me and other security

203
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,639
professionals were saying right around

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,960
2012

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,879
2013 on and on but

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
the business guys kept saying you know

207
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
we're going to go with the cloud anyway

208
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
and so you can see this gradual increase

209
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,960
that took place

210
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
these are job openings of all kinds not

211
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
just security professionals so you can

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
see this kept

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
increasing and then i didn't think

214
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
i thought it was going to level off but

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
it didn't it kept increasing and then

216
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
you can see until we hit the pandemic

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,840
cloud job openings decreased

218
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
and i wasn't sure what was going to

219
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
happen is it going to stay low and now

220
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
look what's happened i just

221
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
checked this a few days ago it's just

222
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,639
skyrocketing so

223
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
this has to this is cloud security jobs

224
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,958
business jobs developer jobs i tell

225
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
everybody forget plastics you know go

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
into the cloud so anyway that's

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
nothing to do with the talk back to the

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,440
talk so cyber crime

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
gartner said i read a gartner report

230
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
like eight years ago they said

231
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
cyber security is an annuity they called

232
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
it and one of the reports said it's an

233
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
annuity for the next 25 years right so

234
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
we're all in a good field and

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,959
just look at these numbers so there's

236
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
seven and a half billion

237
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
cell phone there are more cell phone

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
subscriptions out there than people

239
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
uh of those about 3.9 billion have

240
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
internet access and it's just the basic

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,959
economic inequality that's going to

242
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,920
lead people in some of these other uh

243
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
undeveloped countries to

244
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
uh you know really go into the cyber

245
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,880
crime as a business so qatar has a

246
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
annual per capita income of almost 140

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
000

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,600
central african republic 700 bucks and

249
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
then the other thing that's really going

250
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,279
on is population

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
changes sub-saharan africa is going to

252
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
be 2x

253
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,399
china by the end of this century so

254
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
so unfortunately um cyber security

255
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
is going to be an annuity for everybody

256
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
in the field

257
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
so how do we prevent cyber crime so

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
there's a lot of different statistics

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
out there and

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
you know depending on which vendor

261
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
you're talking with i'm a little i'm

262
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
speaking a little bit tongue-in-cheek

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
about vendors okay i love working with

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
vendors but

265
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
you know if they have an antivirus

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
product they'll say

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
viruses are the cause of breaches or

268
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
somebody else with a

269
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,959
uh endpoint detection response service

270
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
will say that's the problem so there's a

271
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
lot of statistics

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
and stuff that are hard to rely on so i

273
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
decided i want to get involved in

274
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
investigating actual cyber crime

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
breaches what happened in these breaches

276
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,320
what and

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,399
the key thing i'm trying to figure out

278
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
is what's the root cause of the breach

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
and i'm finding that you've got people

280
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
human factors and technology

281
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,240
factors so you've got more than one root

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
cause

283
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
and i don't know i'm an electrical

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,800
engineer i don't know about you guys i

285
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,120
think

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
i like to see things black and white so

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
i like to see there's

288
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
one cause but it doesn't really work out

289
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
that way right there's multiple causes

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
that we have to kind of deal with at the

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
same time

292
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
so the objective of my research into

293
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
cyber crime is to come up with

294
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
better defenses so to start with we got

295
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,160
to look at who

296
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
you know who's committing their what

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,519
what are the nature of the crimes

298
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,880
because a lot of times if we're in

299
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
technology

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
we're focused on technical solutions to

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
what we think are technical problems or

302
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,880
uh

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
mitre attack framework tools techniques

304
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
and procedures we're looking at how do

305
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
we combat those but

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
i think we need to start looking a

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
little higher level what are the actual

308
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
nature of the crimes that are going on

309
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
here so the first one the number one

310
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
according to last year's fbi

311
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,440
crime uh report or summary report is

312
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,839
this business email

313
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,320
compromise and so that's in

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
uh that would be in billions and then

315
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
the second one

316
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
this is in terms of money loss not in

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,959
terms of number of

318
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,240
incidents confidence romance schemes

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
costing 600 million

320
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,680
investment frauds like ponzi schemes

321
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,160
identity theft and on down the list real

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
estate

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
the interesting thing was that

324
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,360
ransomware is only 29 million but they

325
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
have two asterisks here and they say

326
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,959
not all ransomware incidents are

327
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,600
reported

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
so this is kind of uh where i'm starting

329
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,360
in terms of

330
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
what should we be protecting ourselves

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,399
against should we

332
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,200
and it looks like email compromise is is

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,399
the number one at least on this list

334
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
and another thing the reason why i

335
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
started looking into this

336
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
crime root cause analysis i kind of saw

337
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
i have a lot of gray hairs

338
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,800
i've been around for a while i've only

339
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
worked in security full-time for about

340
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
the last 20 years i know

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
people up at purdue have worked on it a

342
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,839
lot longer but i

343
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
i kind of get annoyed that we sort of

344
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
keep repeating ourselves in this

345
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,480
industry and i have this picture of this

346
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
hamster

347
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
i don't know if any now when i was a kid

348
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,279
hamsters were

349
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
like the number one pet you could have

350
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
you know i don't see too much about

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
hamsters anymore

352
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
but in security we definitely keep

353
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
doing the same things that we're doing

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
before so people

355
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,279
are saying in the headlines about solar

356
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,920
winds oh my god somebody's using

357
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
code signing somebody's injecting

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
malware into the software development

359
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,720
life's like oh we've never seen that

360
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
whereas if you go back to 2000 i just

361
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,079
did a little research

362
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,680
flame this breach back in 2012

363
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
used code signing to disrupt microsoft

364
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,279
windows

365
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
and then people are talking about oh my

366
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
god solar winds it's a third-party

367
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,399
breach we've

368
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,240
like we've never heard of a third-party

369
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,120
breach what about target back in 2013

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,079
where the

371
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
hvac company was the path by which

372
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,760
hackers got into target so

373
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,639
somehow we need to do more work i think

374
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,079
on the

375
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
root cause analysis and just keeping

376
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
track of things that we already know

377
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
and another one here are these sim tools

378
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,560
so

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
i manage security for a big car company

380
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
for a while and set up one of the first

381
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,240
sim tools

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
and i remember they started to get more

383
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,519
uh

384
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
publicity and traction around 2005

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,839
and i recall very clearly that they were

386
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,600
going to solve all our problems by

387
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
collecting all the data and allowing us

388
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,480
to do

389
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,120
uh correlation and log analysis and on

390
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
and on now i see

391
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
this new product xdr extended detection

392
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
and response

393
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,360
they're saying the same thing we're

394
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
doing exactly the same thing one thing i

395
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
do not want to be

396
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,199
i would not want to be a product manager

397
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,720
trying to sell xdr

398
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
solutions given that i've already my

399
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
company might have already sold

400
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,240
25 different security products so anyway

401
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
i'm speaking a little tongue-in-cheek

402
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
but we keep going around in circles

403
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
and since this is a talk on security i

404
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,519
have to quote sun

405
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
tzu so he says and people always say

406
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,120
this

407
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
if you know the enemy and know yourself

408
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
you need not fear the result of a

409
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
hundred battles right

410
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,519
if you know yourself but not the enemy

411
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
for every victory gain you also suffer a

412
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
defeat

413
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
so i think most people spend a lot of

414
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
time looking at the enemy right just

415
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,120
think of the mitre attack

416
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
framework and all the tools techniques

417
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
and procedures that are in there but he

418
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
also said you have to know yourself so i

419
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,639
think

420
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,040
i think an effective security defense

421
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
really requires

422
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,120
that we look in our own organizations

423
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
and figure out

424
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,639
what led to the breach so that that's

425
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
kind of

426
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
what i'm advocating in this presentation

427
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
and so i have as i said i spent three

428
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,480
years

429
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
building a security program for a global

430
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
car company

431
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
and it's really hard why is it hard it's

432
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
got it's gotten harder

433
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
so you start with a compliance framework

434
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,839
which is

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,560
kind of a static you know there's hipaa

436
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,959
there's

437
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,480
um pci there's uh the nist cyber

438
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,839
security framework there are many

439
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,680
compliance frameworks they tend to be

440
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
somewhat static

441
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,040
here's a checklist or here are some

442
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
objectives that you should have

443
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,000
and then you try to build that out with

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
the security technology that's out there

445
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,079
and this is a list

446
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
i think anybody who's studying security

447
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,079
at the graduate or undergraduate level

448
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
should be familiar with this list of

449
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
security companies

450
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
they're put in categories here in this

451
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
book called the security yearbook

452
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,800
there's

453
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,399
different people have analyzed the

454
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
industry in different ways

455
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
but there are 2336 vendors

456
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
so the question for the security

457
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
managers how do you spend the next

458
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,959
dollar which one of these vendors do you

459
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,480
spend money on

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,959
how do you implement the compliance

461
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,079
framework

462
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
you know these compliance frameworks are

463
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
standardized by nist and many other

464
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
groups how do you actually

465
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
put it into practice because you you

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,040
can't do it yourself

467
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
you've got to use some of these tools or

468
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
vendors here

469
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,480
so that's the challenge so i think

470
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
building

471
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
an enterprise security program is really

472
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,039
hard

473
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,319
and so i'm advocating doing

474
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
more root cause analysis this isn't like

475
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,839
a new invention

476
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
all best practices around security at

477
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,959
least have a couple of sentences i just

478
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,959
looked at the nist cybersecurity

479
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,000
framework

480
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
and there is there is a there are a

481
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
couple of sentences in there

482
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,559
about after you recover from an incident

483
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
you need to do a root cause analysis

484
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,480
and prevent it from happening but i

485
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
think we don't do enough about

486
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,880
that so if we did more root cause

487
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
analysis it's going to improve our own

488
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
processes

489
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,120
internally and then potentially

490
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,160
we could figure out better ways to share

491
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
information between organizations after

492
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,840
breaches

493
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,480
how many organizations come out in any

494
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
way shape or form

495
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
to talk about what caused the breach in

496
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
their organization

497
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
it's all just kind of hush hush

498
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
and this is and i think one of the

499
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
things that i think is

500
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
about the security industry that's these

501
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
frameworks

502
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
like the cyber security framework or the

503
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
cmmc

504
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,080
the new newer cmmc framework they talk

505
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
about maturity levels and this is also

506
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
an idea that's been in the

507
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,480
security industry for years but now it's

508
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,200
becoming

509
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,480
more part of the standards that are

510
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
out there so my part of my message is

511
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,000
let's focus more on internal variables

512
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
in our organizations not just the

513
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
attackers

514
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
and we need to translate security events

515
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
into business

516
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
terms better than than i think we have

517
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
been

518
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,240
and this so i that's how i'm teaching

519
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
this program or running this program in

520
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
cyber defense so

521
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
i i got interested in this and it's

522
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
really hard to find

523
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160
out what happened in a security breach

524
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
right we just had solar winds we had the

525
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
microsoft exchange breach

526
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
why did microsoft delay patching

527
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
the exchange server you know they're not

528
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,799
talking about it nobody

529
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,440
nobody knows what's happened so it's

530
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
very hard

531
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,840
to find breach information and there was

532
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,080
an

533
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
act i don't know if people remember the

534
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,360
cisa act of 2015

535
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
was an information sharing act it said

536
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
companies should share more information

537
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
with the federal government they were

538
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
going to like home the department of

539
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,080
homeland

540
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,559
security they were going to turn around

541
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,440
reformat

542
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,919
process the information scrub it and

543
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
then share it to the fbi back out to

544
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
these organizations and i remember i

545
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,760
wrote a an

546
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
article for an aba american bar

547
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,760
association journal i

548
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
collaborated with an attorney we both

549
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
wrote it and we were

550
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
both a little bit skeptical is this

551
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
thing going to work

552
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
and there was a lot of ballyhoo about it

553
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
it's really going to work and i just saw

554
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
a couple days ago

555
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
a report from the inspector general

556
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
looking at how much

557
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
information has been shared and so far i

558
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,360
think only

559
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,320
nine companies have shared any

560
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
information with the department of

561
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,679
homeland security and

562
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,799
so because you know with solar winds and

563
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,720
you know the biden administration is

564
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
saying we need more information

565
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
sharing and i'm wondering what's going

566
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
on here we already had a law about that

567
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,799
but i think

568
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,960
companies just chose not to share

569
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,799
information with the federal government

570
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,760
so

571
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
there are other areas i also saw a

572
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
reference to this psqia

573
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
patient safety and quality improvement

574
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,679
act legislation from 2005.

575
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,000
so i don't know all the details of this

576
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
but healthcare organizations

577
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,720
are incented to share safety and quality

578
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,000
information

579
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
with other organizations so i think it

580
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
draws kind of a

581
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,919
moat if you have let's say if some

582
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
patient dies for xyz procedure or some

583
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
piece of equipment doesn't work

584
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
you don't have to publicize it exactly

585
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
what happened but there is a

586
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
sharing algorithm whereby hospitals and

587
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,240
other healthcare organizations can

588
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
share this kind of information with each

589
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,559
other so that that might be something

590
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,080
that we could do

591
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,159
in security so the question is how do

592
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,679
you figure out

593
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
what happened in a breach so books

594
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,240
articles and i've started doing

595
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
a fair amount of legal research using

596
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
this website

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,000
pacer pro pacer pro is a website

598
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
you can you set up an account you can go

599
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
in there and you can

600
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
look at the trial record for different

601
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
cases so if somebody's indicted for a

602
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
security breach

603
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
or a computer fraud and abuse act the

604
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,960
whole

605
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,760
court transcript will be there and at

606
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,080
least

607
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
at the beginning in the indictment you

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,280
can see

609
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
what was done and so i

610
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,520
my my idea is that in a courtroom

611
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,880
people usually are sort of required to

612
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
um tell the truth or whatever be honest

613
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,159
so it's

614
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,120
one way to figure out exactly what's

615
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,559
going on in these different breaches the

616
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,559
only challenge with this is

617
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
if it's a corporation let's say

618
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,960
microsoft gets hacked by somebody

619
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
and that somebody is indicted for

620
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
federal crime or state crime then

621
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,760
oftentimes the victim is going to

622
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
demand that the transcript of that all

623
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
be sealed so you can't really see it

624
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
because they don't want to they don't

625
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
want anybody to know anything about what

626
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
happened so

627
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
it's the constant you know breach

628
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,159
information is clouded and obscure but

629
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
anyway that's one

630
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,320
other source that i've been using so in

631
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
organization

632
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
so this is the usual approach to

633
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
security events

634
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
i'm not talking about crimes but any

635
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
kind of an event here the problems are

636
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,919
identified

637
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
this is what goes on in security

638
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
companies i mean in

639
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
many enterprises there's immediate

640
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
firefighting containment

641
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
and then problems reoccur so i think we

642
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
need to put more emphasis

643
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
on the part that comes after the

644
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
containment this root cause analysis

645
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
validated solutions and then solutions

646
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,159
applied across the organization

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,120
so i see security as a continuous

648
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,320
improvement

649
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
process that that we need to feed and

650
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,240
take care of

651
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
and so to do that there are other tools

652
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
and techniques from other fields like

653
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,840
industrial engineering does this

654
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,880
often looking at manufacturing processes

655
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
what went wrong with the process and

656
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
there's this interesting diagram

657
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
you know it's sometimes called a cause

658
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
and effect diagram or a

659
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ishikawa diagram ishikawa fishbone chart

660
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
so all it is is a brainstorming tool

661
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
that you you know if you have an

662
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,080
incident or it could be just a security

663
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,000
event the system goes down or

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,720
some machines are uh when i was at the

665
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
auto company i came in one morning i

666
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
found that 200 of my users

667
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
were deleted from active directory and

668
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
so that's

669
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,520
that's a security event that had that i

670
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
had to deal with at the time so

671
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,360
how do so when you when you want to

672
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
figure out what happened

673
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,679
this is a tool for kind of brainstorming

674
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,520
and getting a group of people together

675
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
around a table and say

676
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,799
what are the things that went wrong and

677
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,279
in the in the cause and effect diagram

678
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,080
the

679
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
goal is to organize the causes into

680
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
certain categories so that if you have

681
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,080
another event

682
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,200
you can use similar categories and start

683
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,039
figuring out g do we have a people

684
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,240
training problem

685
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
do i have a process problem do we have

686
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
you know what do we have

687
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
so i put four buckets here just based on

688
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
my own experience in security defense

689
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,080
you've got people

690
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
obviously in the loop you've got

691
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,559
security processes hopefully

692
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,600
you may be outsourcing to msp mssp

693
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
vendors or partners you may have

694
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
technology issues

695
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,279
so these are four buckets by the way i

696
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
didn't put hackers in here

697
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,960
because that's not you know it's not

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
under our control so these are the

699
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,880
internal things that

700
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
uh you could consider controlling or

701
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
hopefully could control in your

702
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,799
organization

703
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,320
and then there are other some some other

704
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,480
things that are important here

705
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
a problem may have more than one root

706
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,440
cause so as i said as an engineer

707
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
we like things black and white we want

708
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
to find what's the one root cause go

709
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
look for that

710
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
and whereas that may not be the answer

711
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
there may be more than one root cause

712
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
contributing to the problem and that's

713
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
where this kind of diagram

714
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
helps you can see you can document the

715
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
different things that take place

716
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,840
and again if you don't address the root

717
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
cause you can expect you know the

718
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
problem to occur again

719
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
so i want to do an example so in

720
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
in the ideal world i'd have a lot of

721
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
these analyses done i just did one

722
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
um here's a question let's see if i can

723
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,880
answer it

724
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
um

725
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,600
somewhere someone's looking for database

726
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,559
of breaches

727
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
to get social engineering

728
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,480
cases um i can is there a way

729
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
um professors feel like i can get back

730
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,720
to people if i don't have an answer

731
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
right at the top of my head for this or

732
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,520
um you can just answer the question

733
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,120
okay um i'll i'll type i basically will

734
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
say

735
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
send me an email

736
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,840
with this question because i don't have

737
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,679
an immediate answer this person's

738
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,600
looking for um

739
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
a database of breaches that were caused

740
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
by social engineering i wish i had that

741
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,799
so i don't have that at this point but

742
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
because the the breach information

743
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,799
scattered all over the place and

744
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
i don't it would be good to have it

745
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
better organized that's a good topic for

746
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,159
a thesis but

747
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,600
so this is one um i'm gonna just

748
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
here's the root cause analysis i was

749
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,720
doing

750
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
and here's an example let's go back to

751
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
the equifax breach in 2017.

752
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,240
and i'm using this one i didn't go

753
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,600
through the court case i

754
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,200
there's a book by graeme payne about

755
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
this breach and he he is

756
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,520
and was a very respected cyber security

757
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,640
risk analysis uh analyst and and manager

758
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
basically in atlanta

759
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,080
and at the time of this breach he got he

760
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
was promoted to

761
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
a chief information officer of a at the

762
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
division of equifax

763
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,480
and so he told the whole story of

764
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
exactly what happened and so what did

765
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
happen is 145 million records were

766
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,279
breached in 2017.

767
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,520
interesting the company started in

768
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,799
maryland as a

769
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
two brothers started as a credit

770
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,399
reporting service

771
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,200
and then i don't know if anybody uh two

772
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,520
uh

773
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
i guess chinese pla members were charged

774
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
with the crime

775
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
about a year ago i don't know if anybody

776
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,799
that that's about it right that's as far

777
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,559
as that's going to go and so

778
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,600
it the the actual attack path was

779
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,080
through

780
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,520
a system uh something called the dispute

781
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
resolution system aces that

782
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
equifax had so if you wanted to complain

783
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,679
about your low credit score

784
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,559
you'd log into this system and take some

785
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,360
action so that was what happened so

786
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
dhs uh in march published a bulletin

787
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
about a critical vulnerability in that

788
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
particular software uh march

789
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,799
9th the security so here's where the

790
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,320
here's where the ball got dropped so the

791
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,720
next the security team

792
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
didn't didn't really

793
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
they notified the cio the guy who wrote

794
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,799
that book that the system needs patching

795
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,640
but the cio didn't see the email

796
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,399
and then a couple months later as you

797
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,840
can see the breach you know the breach

798
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,399
was made public on september 19th so

799
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,200
what happened here you know so this is

800
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
my

801
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
ishikawa fishbone diagram of that so

802
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,159
here was this enormous breach

803
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,679
147 millions records so what happened so

804
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,919
can you blame the security the security

805
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,559
people sent the information

806
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
to the cio who was responsible for

807
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,200
patching systems like one day after they

808
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,880
heard about it so you'd say

809
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
wow they did really great but look at

810
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
this this process

811
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,240
the breach remediation pro or

812
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
vulnerability

813
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,320
management process relied on just random

814
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,799
work

815
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
emails going from one department to the

816
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
next right

817
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,200
that was so this is a horrible process

818
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
and then on the people's side i don't

819
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,279
even know if you can blame the cio so he

820
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,600
got

821
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,159
200 emails per day he said in the book

822
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,080
and the court testimony when this thing

823
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,640
went to

824
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,279
went into senate hearings rather so he

825
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,440
just missed that particular email that

826
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,399
said

827
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,679
patch the apache servers and then

828
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,320
another

829
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
aspect of this was that there were

830
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
unpacked servers that remained

831
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,840
unpatched because equifax didn't even

832
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
know they existed

833
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,159
these were all part of that asus system

834
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,919
that i was talking about so

835
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,240
what kind of a you know there are huge

836
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,360
companies and

837
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,679
organizations devoted to i.t asset

838
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,760
management so how come they couldn't

839
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,080
identify unpatched you know there's

840
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
technology to solve this problem

841
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
so i see at least three causes the

842
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
or two two huge causes here right that

843
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
the process

844
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,200
of notifying the uh

845
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,640
it managers about a

846
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,559
critical vulnerability was completely

847
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,039
non-functional

848
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
and the second thing that wasn't

849
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
functional was their i.t

850
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
asset management process and both of

851
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
these there are workflow tools out there

852
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
and they're it asset management tools so

853
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,799
that's kind of

854
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,360
how i see this i don't know what if

855
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,440
equifax did this kind of process or what

856
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,919
but this

857
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,480
is sort of what's needed to make sure

858
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
that issues like this don't reoccur

859
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
so i'm just going to talk a little bit

860
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,880
about

861
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
five other cyber crime stories i haven't

862
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
done the full

863
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,440
ishikawa diagram analysis for them but

864
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,120
i've kind of started to

865
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
collect information on what happened

866
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
here and they very

867
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,760
they vary quite a bit here so i did i

868
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,799
did do one

869
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,240
on uh this romance scam thing here and

870
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,519
that's this one so

871
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,720
i use this sometimes to talk about why

872
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
you should protect your privacy and it's

873
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,480
not only

874
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
business issues right uh everybody knows

875
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
the more

876
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
information you put out there the more

877
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,279
likely you're gonna get

878
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
a really good phishing email right so

879
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,919
how many people are getting

880
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,640
emails that are directly related to

881
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,440
their work

882
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
so i had a microsoft azure subscription

883
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,360
that i let cancel expire

884
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
and then like three days later i get a

885
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,880
phishing email

886
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
saying oh we're so sorry you uh didn't

887
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,919
renew your azure subscription just click

888
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:08,640
here to

889
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,880
put in your credit card and start it up

890
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,760
again so it was

891
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,799
a total fake but anyhow this is a case

892
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,279
that took place in maryland

893
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,360
and these two people got romantically

894
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,039
involved they broke up in

895
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
may 2016. and the guy

896
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
aka he's the guy jk is the woman so ak

897
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,799
took over these six accounts

898
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,320
so he must have known the password

899
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
or guest he guessed the password from

900
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,960
his former romantic partner took over

901
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
all these accounts

902
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,720
then he sent spoofed threatening myth

903
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,880
messages from her to himself

904
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,080
okay so get that he faked threatening

905
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,519
messages from her to himself

906
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
then he you know he had those messages

907
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,559
on his

908
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,880
uh iphone or whatever kind of phone he

909
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,000
had

910
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
and he took that phone to the police and

911
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
then had her arrested and jailed six

912
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
times

913
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,840
and so you just have to kind of register

914
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,039
what's going on here he's

915
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,080
faking messages from this woman

916
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
to himself and then going to the police

917
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,279
and getting her arrested

918
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,760
and so just some general recommendations

919
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,039
you guys are already doing this

920
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,240
monitoring

921
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,279
privacy on social media platforms

922
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,799
use password managers use multi-factor

923
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
protect all these accounts one other

924
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,679
thing i'm trying is this jumbo privacy

925
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,200
it speeds up the uh

926
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
management of your social media accounts

927
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,320
you are

928
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
turning over some of your information to

929
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,480
them but so far it's

930
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,919
proved to be pretty effective

931
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,440
and then of course multi-factor

932
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
authentication

933
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
i also note a lot of security

934
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,000
professionals say well we have to use

935
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,960
one-time passwords we can't use sms but

936
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,840
for the average

937
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,639
user probably sms is going to be better

938
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,280
than

939
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
one factor or no or no two-factor

940
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,839
authentication

941
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,679
so here's another case that's more

942
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
business focused it's a trade secret

943
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,520
theft case so

944
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
i'm going through this to try to figure

945
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
out what caused this and what can we do

946
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,159
to figure it out

947
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,800
to to prevent it from happening in this

948
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
organization or others so this was a

949
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
hospital in columbus ohio

950
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,719
nationwide children's hospital and

951
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,800
it was a trade secret theft a lot of

952
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,639
these trade secrets

953
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,199
theft cases involved internal and

954
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,040
external people so

955
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,719
insiders and outsiders and

956
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,159
this occurred right around 2017. this

957
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,760
was also

958
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,879
after uh the u.s china agreement not to

959
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,399
conduct or knowingly support

960
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
cyber-enabled theft of intellectual

961
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,000
property i guess you guys probably

962
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,720
you know the obama administration

963
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,200
promoted that and i think there was

964
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,280
a period of time where it appeared that

965
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,320
there would be less

966
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,440
theft of chinese uh from uh chinese you

967
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,640
know effective

968
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,400
intellectual property so these two

969
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,839
people

970
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,200
yz and lz i don't put

971
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
names in here because if this is in the

972
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,040
public domain i don't want to get sued

973
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,839
by anybody

974
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,560
so i just put yz and elsie they worked

975
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,119
at nationwide children's hospital

976
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,000
doing something called exosome research

977
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,040
i don't know exactly what an exosome is

978
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
but it's a sophisticated cellular

979
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
communication mechanism as far as i

980
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
understand

981
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,440
and during this period of time in 2015

982
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
they started a chinese company

983
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,599
doing the same thing that they were

984
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,920
doing in china

985
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,880
and then a year later in 2016 they

986
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
started a u.s

987
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,400
company doing the same kind of thing

988
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,079
while they're working at nationwide

989
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,680
children's hospital nationwide

990
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,839
children's doesn't sound like

991
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
a super research hospital but apparently

992
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,640
it has very sophisticated research in

993
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,119
this particular area

994
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,880
and they also were working for the

995
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,960
chinese state administration

996
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,400
of foreign expert affairs and they used

997
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,880
their

998
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
email to send trade secrets

999
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,320
to chinese and personal email accounts

1000
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,000
okay so what is going on here so this

1001
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
attack went on for

1002
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,359
years not it just didn't it's not like a

1003
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,079
typical

1004
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,079
or maybe a you know not typical there

1005
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,160
are no typical breaches right but

1006
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
these trade secret thefts can go on for

1007
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,760
years whereas

1008
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,240
a typical breach seems to be detected a

1009
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
little bit more quickly in months

1010
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,560
so but these people were exfiltrating

1011
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720
this information for years so what was

1012
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
missing on the technology side

1013
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,680
data loss prevention where was the data

1014
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
loss prevention

1015
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,920
that would stop these people from you

1016
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
know sending emails with

1017
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,599
research information that's one thing

1018
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
and then the second thing is where was

1019
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
the middle management training

1020
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,119
on how to manage risk supervision of

1021
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,720
employees

1022
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,560
where were the privileged access

1023
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
management systems

1024
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
and where was the understanding of dlp

1025
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,880
to make sure that people can get access

1026
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,720
to information that they should get

1027
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,920
and not more information so i think the

1028
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
main that to me this is kind of a

1029
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
shocking kind of incident that

1030
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,880
uh the the people running this hospital

1031
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,839
weren't educated enough about risk and

1032
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,839
weren't educated enough about

1033
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,079
some of the threats that could go wrong

1034
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
that's how i read this we need

1035
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,119
one of my mantras is more security

1036
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,640
technical education for non-security

1037
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,480
professionals that's kind of

1038
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
what my root cause analysis of this is

1039
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:55,520
people

1040
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,880
need to know how easy it is to ex build

1041
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,200
a

1042
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,920
exfiltrate information from a research

1043
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
environment

1044
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,320
out into uh you know potentially

1045
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
people that shouldn't have the

1046
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,119
information now this next one this is my

1047
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,200
favorite case to talk about this you

1048
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,119
remember back from the fbi report this

1049
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,720
is the top

1050
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,280
crime that they're reporting in their

1051
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,760
system

1052
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
business email compromise this thing is

1053
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
you would not believe this would happen

1054
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,200
so um this this was a case like

1055
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,640
five or six years ago where money i

1056
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
think it was 15 million bucks or

1057
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,240
15 to 17 million dollars was transferred

1058
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,200
from this company squolar

1059
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,960
to a chinese bank of china

1060
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,000
and it was done through an orchestrated

1061
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
group of attackers they haven't been

1062
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
found the money hasn't been recovered

1063
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,280
and there was it's almost like a a

1064
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,880
tragedy that took place here there were

1065
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,680
the hackers a group of hackers

1066
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
there was the ceo of the company chuck

1067
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,079
lc

1068
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,119
there was an outside attorney i forgot

1069
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,760
his name

1070
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,079
and there was the company controller

1071
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
kevin mcmurtry

1072
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,599
kevin was the target of this attack and

1073
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
you think it couldn't happen here but

1074
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
it's happening all the time right you

1075
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,680
saw the numbers

1076
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,960
uh uh it was in the billions right for

1077
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
uh business email compromise so this was

1078
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,280
only 15 million so what happened here

1079
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,560
was

1080
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,760
the hacker initially sent an email to

1081
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
the ceo

1082
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,079
um no i'm sorry it was from the ceo it

1083
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,000
was spoofed

1084
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,760
and it it the the uh

1085
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,119
so somebody found the email contact

1086
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,560
information

1087
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
and they figured out who's the

1088
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,000
controller of this company

1089
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
kevin mcmurtry they sent him an email

1090
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,280
and they

1091
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,200
they spoof the sender this doesn't look

1092
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,960
like the ceo's email address but they

1093
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
spoofed it and they said we've got this

1094
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
hot project ft

1095
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,119
809 this is an email from ft 809

1096
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,440
strictly confidential information

1097
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,079
takes priority so they really tried to

1098
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,040
catch the fish

1099
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,520
kevin mcmurtry and i guess you can see

1100
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,400
things like bad

1101
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,920
english here that you need to look out

1102
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
for

1103
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,280
and the next email also from that same

1104
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
fake email address to kevin mcmurtry it

1105
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,720
says

1106
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
we've been working on acquiring a

1107
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
chinese company

1108
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
please reach out to attorney rodney

1109
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,359
lawrence that was the kpmg guy

1110
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,280
for information on where the funds need

1111
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,520
to be deposited and then that

1112
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,839
a fake email address was provided for

1113
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,119
that kpmg

1114
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,240
dash office that's not the

1115
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,079
email address of kpmg which would be

1116
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,520
kpmg.com i think

1117
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,200
okay so another fake email and then the

1118
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
third one

1119
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,160
also from oh no this was from uh

1120
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,359
uh rodney lawrence right the attorney

1121
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,480
and so actually it was a spoofed uh

1122
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,599
email from rodney lawrence the spoof uh

1123
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,119
kpmg attorney went to the controller

1124
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,400
please wire this amount to shanghai

1125
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,480
it's actually shanghai bank not bank of

1126
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,319
china amount 780

1127
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,280
000 and it started out really small it

1128
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
was only 780

1129
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,160
000 they were asking for

1130
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,760
the next one the same kind of thing

1131
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,960
uh actually this was from the the ceo so

1132
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
it said well actually we need more money

1133
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,440
we need

1134
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
seven million please proceed as asap

1135
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
with this wire

1136
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,280
so it was 780 000 then it went to 7

1137
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,200
million

1138
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,359
and then following this there was

1139
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,440
another email that said we need another

1140
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,839
7 million so it ended up as 15 million

1141
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,960
dollars and

1142
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,359
this nobody could believe this but this

1143
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,280
actually happened

1144
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,599
and all these guys are consultants now

1145
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,560
except the

1146
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,760
attorney he's still working at kpmg

1147
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
so and so what can we learn from this so

1148
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
you i think one thing you have to

1149
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,960
realize you

1150
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
can't you know we have things like

1151
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
microsoft defender

1152
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
we have advanced you know quote advanced

1153
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,119
threat protection right if you guys use

1154
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,880
outlook i have that

1155
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,200
so you think wow you think this is all

1156
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,720
the problems are you know you

1157
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,119
you can't spoof email you can't get you

1158
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,280
can get past that hackers

1159
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
we've raised the bar on email security

1160
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,040
for sure

1161
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,400
right so you you know you you filter out

1162
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,440
uh url domains and stuff like that still

1163
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,599
but hackers also have raised their game

1164
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,560
up right

1165
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,359
and they're they're kind of uh as good

1166
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:45,839
as

1167
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,240
the defense technology so i think the

1168
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,319
message for users is you still have to

1169
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,800
check your email addresses and content

1170
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
you know i tend to think hey how come

1171
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,880
i'm getting this phishing email i have

1172
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,280
my

1173
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,800
university has advanced threat

1174
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,560
protection but

1175
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,160
so you still can't rely on the

1176
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,920
technology because the bad guys keep

1177
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,359
getting better

1178
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,880
and there's another weird thing with

1179
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,480
this company squolar

1180
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,520
um they still are published on you know

1181
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,599
should they be publicizing their back

1182
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,000
office staff like their controller

1183
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,920
they have this woman here she's on their

1184
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,520
website she's involved with

1185
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,560
she's head of corporate payables

1186
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,040
i just say why is she on the website you

1187
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
know she's just it's just like putting a

1188
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,720
target in the bull's-eye

1189
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,400
so yeah so office 365 has atp

1190
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,640
but it doesn't stop account takeover so

1191
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,480
you still you have to train your users

1192
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,680
on what

1193
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,480
um you know what can the technology do

1194
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,440
and what it what it can't do

1195
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,160
so here's another one uh pii personally

1196
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,480
identifiable information breach

1197
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
this also is somewhat similar

1198
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,280
in some ways to the equifax breach this

1199
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,880
was a company first american title

1200
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,119
a title insurance company and it was

1201
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,920
started in 1889

1202
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,760
and what it does if you buy a house or

1203
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,079
buy

1204
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,079
a property they'll do a title search for

1205
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,520
you

1206
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
and all of this done all this stuff is

1207
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,359
done

1208
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,520
online now right now it's you know you

1209
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,040
used to be in the

1210
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,560
real estate attorney's office now you're

1211
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,480
not even there right it's all remote so

1212
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,680
they had built a

1213
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,880
system called fast where they store

1214
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
all these titles and it turned out

1215
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,760
that you would give a user access to

1216
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,480
look up

1217
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,520
their title or access their title for

1218
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,720
the property they were buying but it

1219
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,160
turned out they could see

1220
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,760
all other 850 million documents

1221
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,200
that were in the entire title database

1222
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,359
and so actually this is a case they they

1223
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,800
have a case against them from the new

1224
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,319
york state department of financial

1225
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:52,960
services

1226
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,520
it's actually i haven't updated it to

1227
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,880
check what happened but they're going to

1228
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,160
get

1229
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,359
some kind of uh

1230
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,079
penalties for for doing this and so what

1231
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,599
happened here so

1232
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,920
some when this application fast was

1233
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,520
created and it had a vulnerability in

1234
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,720
2014

1235
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
and it was only it was discovered not

1236
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,119
that fast right you get you

1237
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,920
you ha you can't give the security team

1238
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,560
too good

1239
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,480
of a mark here it took them four years

1240
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,800
to find this vulnerability

1241
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,720
but still then they sent the report to

1242
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,800
the application team

1243
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
and nobody did anything and one of the

1244
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,520
reasons was when the security team

1245
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,800
filled out the assessment report they

1246
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,040
misclassified the risk as low and that

1247
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,760
could be

1248
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,359
you know they filled out a web form

1249
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,800
somebody hit low

1250
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,480
they didn't have enough internal uh

1251
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,079
checking of what the heck they're doing

1252
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,920
they didn't fix it within the required

1253
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,960
90 days

1254
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,119
and so it took maybe somebody like krebs

1255
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,720
or somebody to publicize this

1256
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
i think it was krebs in may 2019. so

1257
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,079
i've got to go back and see what

1258
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,359
happened but you can see

1259
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,319
a lot of broken processes here right

1260
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,440
people in process

1261
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,400
so fix your remediation process first

1262
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,319
not your vulnerability

1263
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,800
educate boards and senior management and

1264
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,680
keep track of

1265
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,800
risks not just vulnerabilities

1266
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,359
so the last one is ransomware this is

1267
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,599
this is a little bit out of date

1268
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,599
one of the points about ransomware is

1269
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,440
it's really hard

1270
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
to stop this because the people

1271
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,000
carrying it out are overseas and

1272
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,160
at least last year when i created this

1273
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
slide i didn't see that anybody

1274
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,000
had been arrested uh for

1275
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,520
carrying out ransomware attacks these

1276
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,560
two guys that attacked atlanta

1277
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,200
were indicted but they're iranian

1278
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,319
citizens

1279
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,160
and so i don't i don't think anything

1280
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,440
else has happened with that so

1281
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,040
ransomware

1282
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
is really tough to take you know the

1283
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,400
exact

1284
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,599
ways that they're breaking in um

1285
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,160
are not that clear in each case so

1286
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,440
that's one of the

1287
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,240
sort of another one of these breach uh

1288
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,480
black holes of information

1289
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,040
so i'm going to skip that one i might

1290
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,599
skip this one so

1291
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,760
so this so there are various trends

1292
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,359
going on with kobe i see i'm almost

1293
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,359
running out of time here but i did

1294
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,839
so what's the future of cyber security

1295
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,559
so i

1296
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,079
one of the messages here we need to

1297
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,240
focus on the people and process part of

1298
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,319
cyber defense not just technology i

1299
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,359
realize

1300
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,839
um you guys you know at purdue look at

1301
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,839
all aspects of cyber security but here's

1302
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,680
another one so i'm wondering

1303
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,119
as we build these very high barriers

1304
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,040
around all our technology is this the

1305
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,960
future of cyber security i don't know i

1306
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
saw that this guy

1307
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,000
khrushchev he

1308
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,920
entered the u.s a russian citizen

1309
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,520
entered the us in order to breach

1310
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,880
tesla and he recruited somebody only

1311
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
known as chs1

1312
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,200
confidential human source number one

1313
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,880
inside the company in

1314
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,920
tesla's gigafactory in reno and he

1315
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,760
offered him a million bucks for planting

1316
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,920
malware in the tesla network

1317
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,960
but he was the uh i can imagine being

1318
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,520
this

1319
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,040
tesla employee so he uh i guess went to

1320
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,839
the fbi

1321
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,640
anyway he didn't carry this out and so

1322
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,720
the guy was arrested

1323
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,880
and i think he's pled guilty too so i'm

1324
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,040
just wondering is this so i think

1325
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,559
security's going to come we're going to

1326
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,400
become more

1327
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,559
around the human side and the process

1328
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,319
side we need to be aware of that i think

1329
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,200
20 years ago it was all uh let's patch

1330
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,359
windows let's patch windows now

1331
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,440
i think we have to make sure our

1332
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,359
processes work and that our

1333
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,480
human operators are better trained

1334
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,119
so that's sort of the conclusion is to

1335
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:47,520
use

1336
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,839
root cause analysis provide a

1337
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,960
brainstorming

1338
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,920
format within organizations to improve

1339
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,720
the internal security systems

1340
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,599
always invite team members from outside

1341
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,160
the security silo when you're

1342
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,920
doing the brainstorming or going through

1343
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
that ishikawa diagram that i showed

1344
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,400
and then maybe we can develop some kind

1345
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,640
of

1346
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
root cause analysis standards for

1347
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,160
information sharing amongst

1348
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,720
organizations so all i'm in the

1349
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
multi-state isac all i get are

1350
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,960
vulnerabilities vulnerabilities i never

1351
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,200
see anything about you know what caused

1352
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,960
this breach or that breach and how can i

1353
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,040
improve my own defense

1354
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,880
so i think we need to put more weight on

1355
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,160
the people and process

1356
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,240
aspect of security defense not just

1357
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,920
technology

1358
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,559
and if we can get better at analyzing

1359
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,640
crime scenes or sharing information on

1360
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,559
what caused breaches

1361
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,440
we're going to really go a long way to

1362
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:43,680
in

1363
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,359
you know improve our defenses i have a

1364
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,319
few references in the last minutes of

1365
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,160
books that i use

1366
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,200
this thing by john doerr is

1367
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,520
using key performance indicators and

1368
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,960
tracking

1369
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,440
process improvement and then if you're

1370
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
in an organization and interested in the

1371
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,880
people side

1372
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,040
of how do you get your security program

1373
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,800
to be more effective this is a really

1374
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,200
good

1375
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,160
book he's got like a 10-step program on

1376
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,520
improving

1377
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,440
security and then i think um

1378
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,480
many csos have talked about you know yes

1379
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,400
we have controls the question is how

1380
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,520
well do the controls

1381
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,400
work that's execution so that's this

1382
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,800
book by bossidy and charon

1383
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
and a book that i kind of was inspired a

1384
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,240
little bit by

1385
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,599
this josephine wolf she also looks at a

1386
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,839
bunch of security breaches

1387
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,559
and then comes back and says what was

1388
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,880
the root cause of this how do we fix it

1389
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,119
she's looking more broadly at legal and

1390
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,640
economic issues

1391
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,720
uh but it's the same kind of idea it's a

1392
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,000
good read if you have time

1393
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
so i think i have is there any questions

1394
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,839
i have 10 more minutes for questions

1395
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,000
and i have in the chat

1396
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,839
social engineering okay

1397
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,160
any other any questions or comments or

1398
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,200
comments anybody

1399
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,760
uh have any thoughts about how to

1400
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,839
continue this work

1401
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,640
so if i'm still on send me an email

1402
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,960
connect with me on linkedin if you

1403
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,599
have any interest in cyber crime

1404
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,839
analysis or building better defenses

1405
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,280
right

1406
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,720
um so i hear one general question

1407
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,520
here um so you are the um

1408
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,760
you started the cyber security master's

1409
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,359
degree program right

1410
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,920
yeah do you integrate um

1411
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,000
like these type of courses to the

1412
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,640
program there

1413
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,200
um i have i don't have a course

1414
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
specifically on this

1415
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,559
we try to use examples

1416
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,520
you know during the during the courses

1417
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,960
as opposed to one

1418
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,640
just on this so we have a course on

1419
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,160
threats our program is

1420
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,119
31 credit hour courses actually so we do

1421
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,119
we try to include as many

1422
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,280
real world breach examples but i don't i

1423
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,640
don't have a specific course on this yet

1424
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,520
okay okay i thought maybe that might be

1425
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,559
a

1426
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,760
a general course um

1427
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,839
basically examining like different

1428
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:06,960
policies

1429
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,079
maybe right on the companies

1430
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,960
uh spaff has a uh one similar course at

1431
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,240
purdue here

1432
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,280
like the ethics policy ethics

1433
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,160
um or security policies uh in different

1434
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,319
organizations

1435
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,640
yeah or just one course on cyber crime

1436
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,000
might be interesting right because

1437
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,079
there's so many uh i'd have to get i'd

1438
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,960
have to get some

1439
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,520
fbi people to help me out or some that

1440
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,800
could be interesting right

1441
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,480
have a lot of guest speakers from law

1442
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,240
enforcement

1443
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,279
yes exactly yeah that's a good idea

1444
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,559
all right i think we have one question

1445
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,839
from professor chris clifton here yeah

1446
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,920
kenny um yeah so it says do i see

1447
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,240
completely new things like that like

1448
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,839
likely to happen thinks we aren't trying

1449
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,480
i i

1450
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,680
i'm i'm most

1451
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,240
worried about i didn't even mention this

1452
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,000
really but

1453
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,079
disinformation or misinformation and how

1454
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,040
it's just

1455
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,240
affecting so it's it's really

1456
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,319
i see it as kind of the integrity part

1457
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,240
of security got confidentiality

1458
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,559
availability integrity so

1459
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,359
uh that's the thing that causes me to

1460
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,800
lose sleep it's not

1461
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,400
um you know you see things like uh

1462
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,119
uh synthesized digital images and voices

1463
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,520
and so uh that that's something that

1464
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,440
um you know we've got so we've got

1465
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,240
spoofed

1466
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,200
um we've got account takeover but we

1467
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,079
could

1468
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,960
migrate into human takeover actually you

1469
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,079
know taking over

1470
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,359
uh human voice prints and faces and

1471
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,799
things like that that's

1472
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,760
an area that i think could be uh because

1473
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
the human is always the weakest link in

1474
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,520
security right so

1475
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,920
it's the one that can be attacked the

1476
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,160
most effectively and will continue to be

1477
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,640
so that

1478
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,920
i don't know that's kind of what worries

1479
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,559
me disinformation

1480
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,559
and spoofing humans more effectively

1481
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:21,839
than we're doing right now

1482
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,839
artificial intelligence and you know

1483
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,880
leveraging artificial intelligence for

1484
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:35,839
uh propagating malware and and fraud

1485
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,040
all right are there any questions let me

1486
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,920
