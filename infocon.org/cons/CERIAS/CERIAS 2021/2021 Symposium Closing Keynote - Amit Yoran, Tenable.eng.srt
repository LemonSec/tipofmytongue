1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,160
all right and welcome back everyone

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,280
it has been a very full two days

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,360
each year we try to bring a number of

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,320
interesting

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
presentations panels present research

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
give you an opportunity to get some

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,240
insight into what's happening in the

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,199
world

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
and we like to close it out in grand

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
style with a noted uh practitioner

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
someone who can comment on the state of

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
the world and give us some interesting

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
insights to take away

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
before

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,960
and during the time up to the next

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
uh annual symposium

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,640
this year we're extremely fortunate that

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
to have such a visionary uh as our

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
speaker in

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,600
our closing keynote

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
amit euron has had a

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,640
long career working

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
in government in industry

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,719
and

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,920
he has

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,879
uh

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,720
founded the us cert

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
which he led for for a while uh he

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
founded his own company

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,560
that was uh then later acquired he was

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
president of rsa

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
and now is the chairman

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
and ceo of cannibal corporation

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
a major security provider

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
through all of that he's gained a

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
tremendous amount of insight and

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
contacts into the world of cyber

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
security

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
you heard some of those earlier during

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
the fireside chat

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
and we're now going to enjoy another

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,520
hour of presentation or 15 minutes of

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
presentation uh in our closing keynote

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
so thank you for being here and take it

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
away

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
stop thanks for the uh the invite it's

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
terrific to be here with you and and the

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
entire team it's been a uh

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
uh for the sessions that i've attended

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,399
it's been awesome awesome couple of days

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,119
so

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,320
uh

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
the title that

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
i chose was something like everything is

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
everything is code which uh

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,159
hopefully i won't spend too much time

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
talking about coding i was an absolutely

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
terrible developer

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
probably the only thing i did worse than

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
coding was was computer engineering

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
which is what what pushed me into

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
computer science they they decidedly did

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
not want me to uh

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
to be a computer engineer

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,879
so

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,000
uh spa spaff asked me to uh share some

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
thoughts

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
um

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
and so what you'll hear today is

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
a new talk you're not gonna hear one

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,319
single mention of of product there's no

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
stump speech ideas

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
it also means that what you're going to

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,720
hear today are probably somewhat or may

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
seem somewhat disorganized thoughts

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
they aren't ideas which i've bounced

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
back and forth with many people so

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
there's been very limited feedback

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
there's no polish there are no pretty

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
slides but hopefully uh some real

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
thought-provoking uh

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
comments and maybe we can have a little

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
bit of fun fun with it toward the end in

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
q a

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,879
spaff uh introduced me as a as a

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,640
visionary which is always always

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,000
dangerous

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
usually means you've got one of these

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
one of these uh great beards i'll tell

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
you how visionary i am

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,879
when uh in the early 90s

92
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
i was running a network

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
within the department of defense

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
somebody came up and showed me

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
what was to become the the world wide

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,319
web

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,280
and i was super excited i was like wow

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
and there's 500 sites uh on this and you

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
and the other 500 people with

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
powerful enough desktops and fast enough

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
access to to appreciate will enjoy the

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
web the rest of us will uh stick with

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
our gopher and ftp and telnet and email

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
so visionary perhaps not

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,239
um

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
what i will

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,400
uh

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
try and do over the next 15 minutes or

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
so is is share some thinking on

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
what i what i believe to be

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
observations on the past

112
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
uh the area

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,080
era of uh computer security that we're

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
that we've been living in

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
uh and i won't say it's 2020 but i'm

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,360
reasonably confident that i can

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
accurately describe or i've got some

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
some coherent thoughts around

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
what

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
uh

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
computer security has looked like uh in

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
in the past and then

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
spent a little bit of time talking about

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
the present and and when i described the

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,720
present uh i won't claim a 2020 accuracy

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
i'll say i'm either completely wrong or

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
or maybe

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,639
partially right in some areas but

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,919
unlikely in between and then the future

130
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,280
which uh

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
you know who knows this is uh

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
really difficult to do in in in our

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
field it's it's hard enough

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,759
to see where we're at and where we're

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,199
going over the next couple of years if

136
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
you start thinking four or five years

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
out and beyond that is is completely

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
opaque but if you start thinking about

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,120
four or five years out it's really hard

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
to do because

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
you're not only predicting the changes

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
in compute

143
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
uh it's becoming decidedly harder to

144
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
predict how that compute is is going to

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
be used the the pace with which

146
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
organizations are adopting change are

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
transforming themselves is

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
accelerating at a uh at an unprecedented

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
rate so you know when you start

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
factoring in uh you know the the pace of

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
acceleration it's really difficult to

152
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
see how things will play out over any

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
extended period of time

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,280
so a little bit about you know the past

155
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
and how we got here obviously computers

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,000
you know held tremendous and hold

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
tremendous prop promise they make us

158
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
faster better

159
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
stronger smarter safer

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
um

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
the world of computing

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
to date

163
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
is also a very uh jumbled story it's a

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
very ugly story it's

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,840
a complete mess it's one that is

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
overridden by

167
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,319
old servers and architectures

168
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
and all sorts of complication

169
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,039
and complicated legacy infrastructure

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,720
that we've assembled over the course of

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
decades between hardware and software

172
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
operating systems applications

173
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
very little of which

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
enterprises can really throw out there

175
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
are rare occasions when

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
when we can retire pieces of technology

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
and we should all celebrate that because

178
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
it so rarely happens but we tend to just

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,360
collect baggage uh along along the way

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
and as you do that

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
as you look at the differences in in

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
compute and as people have had a chance

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,400
to to bang up on on these forms of

184
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
compute

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
what we've learned is that computers are

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,000
decidedly not deterministic in nature so

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,759
all the cool computer science stuff that

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
you know we learn about touring machines

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
and finite state automata and all this

190
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,479
sort of stuff is radically different

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,039
than how computers operate in the wild

192
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
and stuff is probably gonna cut me off

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
and and and we'll go to commercial break

194
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
but you know the truth is that there are

195
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,520
just an inordinate number of bugs and

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,319
problems and challenges in the hardware

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,840
and the software and the firmware and

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
the applications

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
and our inability to retire things

200
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
whether they're

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
legacy pcs mainframes

202
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
local networks routers switches desktops

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,919
byod it makes these environments

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,360
completely

205
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,280
uh

206
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,800
non-deterministic and even things that

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
you would imagine that you would hope

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,960
are deterministic like standards

209
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
protocols

210
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
aren't because not only the bugs but

211
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
vendors and manufacturers have developed

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,160
them

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,759
and built them using different

214
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
interpretations or customizations on and

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,919
of the standards which uh which have

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,639
existed and so what we end up and what

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
all of these things end up

218
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
in is a high degree have ended up in is

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
a high degree of non-determinism

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
you can't tell

221
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,120
uh

222
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
with any degree of certainty

223
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,479
what state your compute platform is

224
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
operating at it can't be done

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,319
and

226
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
based on

227
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,280
some unexpected number of unexpected

228
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
inputs some of which you perhaps have

229
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,720
mapped out

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
it is nearly impossible to tell because

231
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
you don't know what those inputs are

232
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
what the next state of your system will

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
be in

234
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,039
so those seams that non-determinism

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,039
i believe have become largely uh the the

236
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,159
gaps

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,720
which with which uh our adversaries have

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
been able to to take advantage of

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,959
compute platforms in ways that you know

240
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
we never would have anticipated and

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
make them uh fall

242
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
fall victim

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
the

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
and the challenges as we try and secure

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
the sprawl of legacy computing none of

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
which you know ever seems to go away

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
is that this mess is constantly growing

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,160
and constantly morphing you know when

249
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
you read the you know the marking

250
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
literature and the vendor jargon it's

251
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
you know where to predict that this and

252
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,720
futuristic that i mean the fact is

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
we don't know

254
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
not only what state we're in but how

255
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,920
secure we are today let alone be able to

256
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,800
predict the future and the actions and

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
the compromises and the vulnerabilities

258
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
and the problems which

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
will be discovered in the future every

260
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,640
year i mean even just this past year

261
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
20 000 plus new vulnerabilities were

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,120
reported by vendors researchers security

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
professionals 20 000 and those are just

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
the reported ones so as we start

265
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,399
thinking through

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640
what is the state of our security how

267
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
secure are we today

268
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
it is incredibly difficult

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
to assess and your assessment

270
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,320
could be wildly different than the

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
reality that exists because there are

272
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
problems

273
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
which people are taking advantage of or

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,160
could be taken advantage of which we

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
simply don't know about we haven't

276
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
discovered them

277
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,640
we haven't haven't understood them

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
further complicating it is the fact that

279
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
this world of

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
compute

281
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,720
is not just a technology problem

282
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
but we've built an ecosystem around the

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
technology that is ill-equipped to deal

284
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
with its dynamic nature the volume and

285
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
inefficiency so

286
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
you know the current processes in an

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
enterprise look something like this

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,040
infosec red team security assessment

289
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
whatever it is trying to determine risk

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,240
finds a bunch of problems in some form

291
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
or fashion

292
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
they hand it over to it which is

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
different group of people in a

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
convoluted process

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
i.t deliberates between

296
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,720
operations business units costs

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,519
does

298
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,399
some version of regression testing

299
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
assessing risk avoiding change control

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,839
windows and freeze windows configuration

301
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,560
management infrastructure and processes

302
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
and then consider some deployment uh

303
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
timeline and so

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
the reality is that it more often than

305
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
not looks at this list of two million

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
487

307
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,600
862 problems and says

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,839
okay security thank you very much uh

309
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,120
we're off to the next business

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
requirement we're gonna deploy the new

311
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,839
capability which our customers are

312
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
actually asking us for and will make the

313
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
corporation more efficient or drive more

314
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
revenue for us rather than dealing with

315
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
the things that you've discovered so

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
security has become literally the tax

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
that nobody wants to pay the tax

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
nobody's willing to pay or

319
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
you know as often as not doesn't even

320
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,240
know how to pay their the problems are

321
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
so great and we're so entrenched in

322
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
processes that don't

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
uh adapt

324
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
and move at the speed of of technology

325
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,040
um and the speed of security that we're

326
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
in a in a uh it's not a never-ending

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
loop it's a loop it's a it's a vicious

328
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
cycle which has us falling further

329
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
further behind and that's basically how

330
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
the security talk track has looked with

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,959
some variations over the last 25 25 to

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
30 years

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
so

334
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
we're at what i think is a pretty

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
foundational shift in

336
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
in how

337
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,040
the world

338
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
thinks about its its computer so i'll

339
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
talk a little bit about what i think is

340
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,000
the present and i'll talk about it in

341
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
two different

342
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
in two different ways one of which is

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
probably closer to accurate we just

344
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
don't know which which yet i don't know

345
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,040
which is and so as depressing as that

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
sounds

347
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
what we're finding now is that software

348
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,519
and we should say software is eating the

349
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
world well okay that's all that's

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
already happened every company is a

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
technology company that's

352
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,839
now obvious that's that's already

353
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,120
happened

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
we're now operating in an environment

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
where cloud

356
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
is eating the world the world of compute

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
is changing dramatically and of course

358
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,120
it's still

359
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,639
you know because

360
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
of the way organizations operate we

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
still have all the legacy stuff to deal

362
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
with but now there's this new cloud

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
thing

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
which um

365
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
which is either really good or really

366
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,360
bad and and i don't think we we know

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
which just yet

368
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
so i'll start off with the bad case

369
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
since it probably aligns more with with

370
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
you know how we've been thinking about

371
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
or how i've been thinking about the past

372
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
world of compute right

373
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
and what i can tell you

374
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
about today's operating environments

375
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,279
is that

376
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,079
we really don't know

377
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
what the hell is what

378
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
for lack of of a better term there's a

379
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,079
there's a

380
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
an abstraction which has occurred and

381
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
for amazing reasons of of efficiency and

382
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
productivity and innovation there's this

383
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
abstraction that has occurred between

384
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
our compute platforms

385
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,199
and

386
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,079
our ability to understand and digest it

387
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,839
so so so what do i mean by that we used

388
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
to have this simple world where you know

389
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,079
the problems that we created but we knew

390
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
we knew were there we had hardware we

391
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
had firmware we had operating systems we

392
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
had software and applications we had

393
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
networks we had routing and

394
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
those are all

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
uh concepts that were fairly

396
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
straightforward to understand and we had

397
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
decades of experience many failures but

398
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
decades of experience building best

399
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
practices around how to secure those

400
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
things and that compute paradigm

401
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
now

402
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,440
we don't really understand or we've been

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
abstract

404
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,040
abstracted from the reality

405
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
of what's what

406
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,360
we don't know

407
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
what our hardware infrastructure looks

408
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
like i mean maybe we do for our ipad or

409
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
our iphone or our pc

410
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,079
but we don't know really where our

411
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
servers are or what they look like and

412
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
who has access to it

413
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,959
we don't know what is a local resource

414
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,720
and what is a remote resource we don't

415
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
understand

416
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,279
where data is and whose data is it and

417
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
where it resides and where it

418
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
traverses

419
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,600
on its way to us and to our processing

420
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
centers and applications and in many

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,639
cases

422
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,639
we can't distinguish between what is

423
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
data and what is executable which is a

424
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,920
separate problem in in and of itself but

425
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
we also have

426
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
uh a high degree of automation where the

427
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
data itself is changing how the system

428
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
behaves and these are all the things

429
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
that we're going to discover in in the

430
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
5g world but even in a in a simple uh

431
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
you know example

432
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
the data within the application changes

433
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,600
how the application behaves and how the

434
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
user interacts with the application uh

435
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
something even something like waze is is

436
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
or a uh

437
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
a navigation app is a great example of

438
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,320
this users report things the data goes

439
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
in the system does its calculations the

440
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,519
data that is part of that system changes

441
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
how the system interacts and the answers

442
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,720
that it gives to its users so it opens

443
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
up a whole

444
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
series of of complexity

445
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,160
which we do not really understand and

446
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
the way the applications work is also

447
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
abstracted from us as we write

448
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,440
applications and function calls

449
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
uh we don't know are these function

450
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
calls local are they on our cloud are

451
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
they on another cloud who's written them

452
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
what are the responses what are the

453
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
interactions with that function and so

454
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,399
the world uh of today and this is not

455
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
kind of where it's going this is this is

456
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
the world that that

457
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
enterprise applications are developed

458
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
the world is just

459
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,639
incredibly incredibly

460
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,599
uh messy and so that's the the the

461
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,079
depression the depressing case around

462
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,520
things are going to get a whole lot

463
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,599
worse as we as we embrace cloud the

464
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
attack surface is much more complex much

465
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,839
more difficult to defend our

466
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
defense paradigms don't don't

467
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
don't really make sense or aren't

468
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
applicable or we have a hard time

469
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,199
applying them and i'm not talking about

470
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,959
firewalls i'm talking about really the

471
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
way we think about security isn't really

472
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,320
applicable in much of today's

473
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
most critical in environments

474
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
i'll talk a little bit about where

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,760
perhaps

476
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
uh things are improving in today's

477
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
environment and i'm not sure which is

478
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,039
which is which

479
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,799
but as we

480
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,919
uh

481
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,559
embrace cloud

482
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
we're changing how

483
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
our infrastructures operate and

484
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
and some of it can be more complex but

485
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,200
some of it can be

486
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
much

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,840
cleaner much more efficient

488
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,000
the world is embracing

489
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
infrastructure as code as a new way of

490
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,440
thinking about and managing i.t so

491
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
it used to be we develop our application

492
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
we call up i.t they provision us a

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
system the application goes on the

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
system and we're off to the races and

495
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
then we move to the first world of cloud

496
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,080
where you write your application

497
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
you call up i.t they provision you a

498
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
virtual machine you run and and you're

499
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
and you're off to the races and that is

500
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,679
you know

501
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
it's been an evolution of a paradigm

502
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,840
that we're reasonably comfortable with

503
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,240
today

504
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,679
efficiency is driving infrastructure as

505
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,679
a code in ways

506
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,799
that many security professionals don't

507
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,880
don't really understand or appreciate

508
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,440
the code

509
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,240
is an expression not only of

510
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
the application and the executable but

511
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
through scripts

512
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,039
it is also the provisioning of

513
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,440
infrastructure and the managing of

514
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,039
infrastructure

515
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,280
on which the code will be

516
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
deployed

517
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,039
at runtime so again

518
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
it helps

519
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
organizations develop incredible

520
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
uh efficiency

521
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
incredible scale you go from code to

522
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,799
publication to runtime

523
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,520
instantaneously

524
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
and you do it efficiently and it doesn't

525
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,919
require human interaction things like

526
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,520
you know hashicorps

527
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
terraform and the whole category of all

528
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
terms amazing

529
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
amazing things which are which are

530
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,120
occurring here

531
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
build your application

532
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
uh deploy your application

533
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
and while this may seem problematic from

534
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
a security perspective

535
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
it also enables

536
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
things to happen from a security

537
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,640
perspective that that we didn't have in

538
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,320
the traditional environment we now have

539
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
code repositories the the git

540
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
repositories we have the ability to do

541
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
not only assess

542
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,799
the integrity of the code but to assess

543
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
the infrastructure as code right the

544
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,480
beauty of this is that it is a digital

545
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
representation

546
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,240
of what the infrastructure looks like

547
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
and the infrastructure which is deployed

548
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
is an exact

549
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,159
uh instantiation of

550
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
that code

551
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
it's it's digital representation and so

552
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,520
now

553
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
for arguably the first time

554
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
we have reintroduced a form of

555
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,440
determinism

556
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
back into our compute environments

557
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
i write the script i know exactly what

558
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
the environment is going to look like i

559
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,520
don't like it

560
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,919
i modify the script i know exactly what

561
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,679
the environment is going to look like

562
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,120
now we have to account for things like

563
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
drift and and and what happens in the

564
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
operating wild

565
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,159
but but there's a an opportunity

566
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,320
to drive

567
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
security compliance resiliency

568
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
management into cloud-based

569
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
infrastructures

570
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,000
in ways that we lost control of in

571
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
traditional environments where there's

572
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
different owners of the systems there's

573
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,480
different operating requirements freeze

574
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
windows configuration management systems

575
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
different groups which own different

576
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
parts of the process all that happens at

577
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
code speed

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
and through digital representation in

579
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
code in the cloud and so

580
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
this

581
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
get centric mindset

582
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
of not only provisioning d provisioning

583
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
but the workflows and the in the

584
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
lifespan

585
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,840
of

586
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,200
our compute environment becomes

587
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
a game changer in uh in cloud-based uh

588
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
in cloud-based environments so

589
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
this is the world we live in

590
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,600
it uh

591
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,240
has new challenges for sure and there's

592
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,679
certainly a good argument to be made for

593
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
the pes for the pessimist security

594
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
practitioner who sees a whole bunch of

595
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,720
of abstractions and uh introduction of

596
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
attack surface that they didn't see

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
previously but there's also new

598
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
opportunity and digital representation

599
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
and determinism that we didn't have

600
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,799
uh that we didn't have in the in the in

601
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,520
the

602
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,080
old world and with the legacy package

603
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,200
now

604
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
the one thing we know is

605
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,880
the

606
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
uh the corporations the enterprises the

607
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
organizations the government agencies

608
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
that we work for will not you know

609
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
they're still using their mainframes and

610
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,799
their

611
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,919
and all the rest of the stuff that

612
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
they've got so they know we know that

613
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
they're not gonna let us get away with

614
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
okay let's just moderate everything not

615
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
lift and shift to cloud but rewrite

616
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
everything for this very clean cloud

617
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,039
world

618
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,799
uh we're stuck with

619
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,760
with the legacy uh baggage

620
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
and so

621
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,480
uh one possible future or the future

622
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
that uh you know that

623
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
we can envision for improving security

624
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
going forward

625
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
is applying this concept of everything

626
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,919
as code

627
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,919
in a near limitless way it starts off

628
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
determining how our cloud-based

629
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,760
infrastructure is

630
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,200
deployed

631
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
governing the rules of operation and

632
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
management and performance of that

633
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
infrastructure

634
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,960
in the cloud but over time

635
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
it's going to evolve it's going to

636
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,360
expand beyond cloud because

637
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,400
git centric operating models are

638
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
compelling and they can offer

639
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
or call unimaginable but tremendous

640
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
gains in

641
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,760
determinism and also efficiency they can

642
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,640
fix

643
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
not only the process legacy processes in

644
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
the cloud but over time

645
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,919
our legacy activities

646
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,640
will move to this get centric

647
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
uh mindset so this isn't

648
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
you know in in part it's a a wild eye

649
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,520
prediction of where things are going

650
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
but it's really not that hard to

651
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,039
envision if you look at some of the

652
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
things that are happening today right

653
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
let's look at a low-hanging fruit

654
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
example

655
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
new hires

656
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,919
um

657
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,520
come into to an enterprise

658
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,880
hr has to rely on it to onboard new

659
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
hires incredibly you know time intensive

660
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
labor intensive requires armies of of of

661
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,400
people especially in high growth

662
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
industries where you're constantly

663
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
hiring and there's and there's high

664
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
churn of employees and so traditionally

665
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,799
hr has to partner with i.t they have to

666
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
partner with facilities and finance and

667
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,480
and a whole slew of people to get new

668
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
people onboarded and provisioned so

669
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
companies are starting to use

670
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,279
hr workflows

671
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,440
some of them get centric some of them

672
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
you know traditional but automated so

673
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
they're trying starting to do workflows

674
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
to programmatically provision

675
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
systems identities authentication

676
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,600
mechanisms access privilege all of these

677
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,120
things happening

678
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
behind the scenes the hr person inputs

679
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,400
the data kicks off the process and the

680
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,360
rest of the workflow escalates and and

681
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
executes in an automated fashion so

682
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,760
again this is a digital representation

683
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
somebody's written the code to automate

684
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
a whole bunch of of manual steps

685
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,320
so this really

686
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
you know in this example it has nothing

687
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
to do with cloud and everything to do

688
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
with efficiency at scale

689
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,919
yes to access cloud but also to

690
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,600
provision and access on-prem systems

691
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
uh and systems as well so

692
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
as we move into this new world

693
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,880
where everything is

694
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,760
written

695
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,159
as code everything is defined

696
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,400
digitally with certain with with

697
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,120
certainty it applies to

698
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,600
you know this shift left mindset

699
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
but it also

700
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
starts defining the current state in the

701
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,640
cloud but increasingly

702
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,360
the state of our legacy environments too

703
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
people will start moving

704
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,799
uh

705
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,919
directory services user services access

706
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,200
and provisioning

707
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,880
from the traditional active directory

708
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,120
types of environments that they've got

709
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
to

710
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,000
a get type of repo that can be defined

711
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,720
that they can interact with efficiently

712
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
and they can drive an automation and

713
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
digitization of the mess that they've

714
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,400
had to to deal with so

715
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
these these git

716
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
uh repositories these cloud repositories

717
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,880
end up becoming

718
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
the focal control point of how the

719
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,039
enterprise operates but also how it

720
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,760
executes from an i.t and a technology

721
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,159
standpoint with much greater focus

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,159
obviously on protecting the repo but

723
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,279
also

724
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,799
uh in the repo's ability to to protect

725
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,480
the enterprise so

726
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,799
code is is

727
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,640
has become the universal language for it

728
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
but increasingly for business processes

729
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,760
and now of course there's lots of all

730
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,679
the layers of abstraction that you know

731
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,600
can become problems and trip us up and

732
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
that sort of that sort of thing but this

733
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,039
is the this is the i think the next big

734
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,159
shift that will be happening in

735
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,880
in technology as we really understand

736
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
what the cloud bought brought to us it's

737
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
not just

738
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
infinite scale and performance and stand

739
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
up and tear down really quickly it's

740
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,640
really this incredible degree of

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
automate automation and digital

742
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
representation of exactly what

743
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,399
everything's gonna

744
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
look like so you know i don't want to uh

745
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
quote linus torvald but i'll say you

746
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
know

747
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,279
when when he says talk is cheap show me

748
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,399
the code

749
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,600
um

750
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
i you know he might have more insight

751
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
for decades

752
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
ahead of ahead of where where we find

753
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,559
ourselves today but certainly certainly

754
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
where we're going so

755
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,919
uh with that

756
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,080
um i'd love to

757
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
open up to the

758
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,840
q a and talk with folks about some of

759
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,919
these crazy ideas and where i've got it

760
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,320
all wrong

761
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
well i certainly wouldn't say you got it

762
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,679
all wrong uh because we don't know yet

763
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,120
but uh it's some fascinating ideas there

764
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,320
so uh anyone who's listening please

765
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,480
use the q a here to post your questions

766
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
i'll i'll ask as we go along uh as we're

767
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
waiting for something here

768
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
it seems to me that

769
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,840
this is providing

770
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,640
potentially

771
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
more complexity

772
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
for configuring some kinds of

773
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
user services or user identities

774
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
and complexity has proven to be a

775
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,919
problem in the past

776
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,039
comments onto that

777
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
complexity has been the enemy of of

778
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
security for sure uh and this does

779
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
introduce complexity the the array of

780
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,720
hope

781
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
uh

782
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
that

783
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,919
i have on this particular complexity

784
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,760
is that it's

785
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,640
digitally defined and represented in

786
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
code which means this complexity can be

787
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
analyzed and understood

788
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,480
in much more definitive ways than

789
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,320
the

790
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
complexity

791
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
of some of the legacy environments that

792
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,799
we've that we've operated in if it can

793
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,480
be digitally

794
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,520
uh defined

795
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
then we can

796
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
we can apply different types of logic

797
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,080
around around protecting it and what it

798
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
should look like

799
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
are you suggesting that perhaps

800
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
applying ai to this is

801
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
is the way to go or

802
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
i mean is that a natural consequence of

803
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,920
this

804
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,159
[Music]

805
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,919
i think apply listen

806
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
for sure ai is a natural

807
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
you know path to to explore and can hold

808
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,279
great promise

809
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,320
uh but even simply

810
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
rules-based you know even just a simple

811
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,039
rules-based approach we can weed out

812
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,520
entire categories of problems that we've

813
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,960
seen before

814
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,840
and

815
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
because everything is defined we know

816
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,679
that our

817
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,919
our search for these problems

818
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
can be complete in

819
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,919
nature versus you know turning over

820
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,559
rocks and finding all sorts of gems

821
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,200
waiting for us

822
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,440
okay

823
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,279
i'm not seeing a lot of

824
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
questions here from

825
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,120
the audience uh

826
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
perhaps this is

827
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,760
too radical of you of the future for

828
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,879
some of them to uh

829
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,440
to approach

830
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,640
oh we have one

831
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,039
do you want to read it yourself or would

832
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,320
you like me to read it

833
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,399
uh do you think that ai will be

834
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,159
automating code

835
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,320
that will also be automating

836
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,880
more code will be creating

837
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,440
unimaginable problems in in the future

838
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,679
um

839
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,760
this is this is this is a tough one i

840
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
don't want to you know go too far down

841
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,240
the rat hole of you know singularity and

842
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,399
and those sorts of things but

843
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,880
you know the the pace of of innovation

844
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,679
that we've been on is has really taken a

845
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
great hockey stick with you know

846
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
computers and and over the last you know

847
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
50

848
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,000
plus years

849
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,440
when

850
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
the pace of innovation you know when we

851
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,399
have ais that will be developing code

852
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,240
and i don't think we're that far away

853
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
and something that happens today but you

854
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,360
know right now

855
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,679
we see ais

856
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,480
producing art producing music

857
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,159
writing literature

858
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
uh to the point where some of it is very

859
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,519
uh

860
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,200
you know difficult to to identify

861
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
whether it's produced

862
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
by by a person or by an ai you know when

863
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,880
we get to the point where ai is

864
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,480
innovating

865
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,080
uh for us

866
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,640
then that acceleration just you know

867
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
everything that is humanly imaginable

868
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
and even beyond that starts happening

869
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,440
much much faster so i don't really um

870
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,399
there's some terrific uh you know

871
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,080
thought work out there about you know

872
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,919
where this all goes but i think that one

873
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,080
of the biggest challenges is around sort

874
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,480
of the application and the development

875
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
of an ethics framework around

876
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,200
these ais before we get to that before

877
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
we get to that point because

878
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
different societies have have different

879
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,120
uh norms and ethics for behavior and of

880
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,440
course our own sense of morality on

881
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,919
various topics changes over time so i

882
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,279
think defining a framework for this

883
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,840
becomes incredibly important

884
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
so looking towards clark's laws of

885
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,360
robotics

886
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,480
as

887
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,600
perhaps inspiration

888
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,720
what do you

889
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
how do you see

890
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,679
the securing of the of the legacy

891
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,799
end-to-end supply chain uh fitting into

892
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,039
this

893
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,080
you know there has been some work

894
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,720
conducted on you know how you develop

895
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,559
secure systems

896
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,880
where you have or trustworthy systems

897
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,279
where you have you know untrusted or

898
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,679
potentially compromised componentry and

899
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,760
so i think you know that type of

900
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,279
analysis and work really needs to be

901
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,080
dusted off and looked at much more

902
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,880
uh you know much more closely

903
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,120
and it's listen it's a market and a

904
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,839
world that we find ourselves in

905
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,280
um

906
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,320
and and one that i think we're

907
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,639
ill-equipped to deal with solarwinds was

908
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
a you know perhaps the prime example of

909
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,359
that where we've got a piece of software

910
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,119
and of course it's signed so it's

911
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,159
trusted

912
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,119
uh but it was in fact compromised and

913
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,239
used to do

914
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,119
uh nefarious things

915
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,918
the

916
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,760
um

917
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,119
and so i think you know i think we're

918
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,800
really

919
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,679
uh

920
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
in an area where we're further and

921
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
further abstracted from what these

922
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
technologies are really doing and you

923
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
know fewer fewer people are able to pull

924
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,000
together the pieces parts to to really

925
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,639
understand what's happening so

926
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,960
i i the one thing i am confident in is

927
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
that the traditional government approach

928
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
of hey this is going to be done on u.s

929
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,800
soil and it's going to be done you know

930
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
by u.s nationals is both not scalable

931
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,079
and or u.s companies is both not

932
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
scalable and you know somewhat

933
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
nonsensical because even u.s

934
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,119
corporations hire foreign nationals and

935
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,240
have some

936
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,599
portion of their software developed

937
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,520
overseas and even if they don't they're

938
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,599
relying on libraries and cloud-based

939
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,280
infrastructures and open source

940
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,359
components which are which are produced

941
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,000
overseas and i'd say a vast majority of

942
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,520
software today

943
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
uh

944
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
you know 85

945
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,240
is

946
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
is software that exists and and the

947
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,320
innovation is really happening and

948
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,079
pulling different libraries together in

949
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,520
different ways so

950
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,119
um you know our traditional approaches

951
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:37,920
to

952
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,320
understanding supply chain security and

953
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
software security

954
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
uh aren't aren't those they aren't

955
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
applicable but they're hardly applicable

956
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
in today's world

957
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
it's not directly related to your vision

958
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,880
but

959
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
the the recent uh

960
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,440
uh executive order to have software a

961
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,200
bill of materials

962
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
um

963
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
do you think that's even going to be

964
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,280
possible for some of these bits of

965
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
software

966
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,079
i i

967
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,880
don't want to ask you what software is

968
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
that's how i feel like responding you

969
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,359
know what is hardware

970
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,880
what is hardware and what is software

971
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
where is my operating system and i'm

972
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
doing an api or a function call is that

973
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
my operating system is it a cloud

974
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
function call is part of it happening

975
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
here part of it happening there whose

976
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
cloud is it operating on and and

977
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,960
it's just

978
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
every everything is you know software

979
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
but it's it's becoming increasingly

980
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
difficult to

981
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,520
draw the lines of distinction that we

982
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,359
that we used to have

983
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,599
i i think that's actually a very fair

984
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,040
answer uh

985
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,160
i i have significant doubts about that

986
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,880
order being successfully

987
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,680
implemented across the board

988
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,440
yeah but it'll get people thinking and

989
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,040
doing something and something is better

990
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,000
than nothing and hopefully it spurs

991
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
great minds to uh to think about the

992
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,079
problem differently and come up with

993
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,040
some exciting new ideas

994
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
um

995
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
sometimes prompting great minds does not

996
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
necessarily result in good results but

997
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,960
uh i'll i'll agree with you uh

998
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,839
we've certainly seen a number of

999
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,400
very exotic ideas that

1000
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
seemed exciting but

1001
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,359
just didn't go anywhere

1002
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
so

1003
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,280
i'm not seeing much else in q a here

1004
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,640
so we'll we'll maybe go another minute

1005
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,880
or two i i think in part

1006
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,359
what you described as

1007
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
really as kind of an evolution

1008
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,560
in

1009
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
the way that we configure and build

1010
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
software

1011
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,200
because

1012
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,040
it envisions a kind of malleability of

1013
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
the underlying environment in which we

1014
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,119
can run

1015
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,160
isn't easy for some people to grasp

1016
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,440
uh

1017
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,680
you have you have the advantage of that

1018
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,119
bit of gray

1019
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,079
where you you've seen enough evolution

1020
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,720
of what we've done in computing

1021
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,960
where we've gone from single threaded

1022
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
single processor

1023
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,599
to

1024
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,560
the virtual machines in the cloud

1025
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
uh that are

1026
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,598
self-contained and variable

1027
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,960
so it's it's easy to project that

1028
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,320
forward

1029
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,720
perhaps

1030
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,839
and i i think uh i know talking to some

1031
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,440
of the students

1032
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,839
in our

1033
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,680
program they don't have that kind of

1034
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,119
perspective

1035
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,400
to be able to see that that evolution

1036
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,920
in where we've gone they know how to use

1037
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
things we have now but it doesn't

1038
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
necessarily convey to them

1039
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,000
the potential to move beyond it

1040
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,200
it will be interesting to see and

1041
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,599
uh i'm also

1042
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,839
i don't know if you've read any of the

1043
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,839
things that works by people like

1044
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,359
charles perrault

1045
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,400
um

1046
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,119
right the coming the the coming disaster

1047
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,160
uh

1048
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
emergent

1049
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,320
behavior

1050
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
the idea that as things get exceedingly

1051
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,720
complex we will develop

1052
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,560
uh catastrophic kinds of flaws that we

1053
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
hadn't anticipated

1054
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,440
that's something we can't predict

1055
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,000
easily right because it's emergent

1056
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,119
behavior

1057
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,200
but would certainly cause uh

1058
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
a more complex system where we don't

1059
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,520
we don't have

1060
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
the components

1061
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,720
right at hand and even understand the

1062
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,560
components that are going into something

1063
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,839
because they're selected out of a

1064
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,440
workflow and they're they're out of a

1065
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
repository in different versions uh

1066
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,760
recovery from something might be more

1067
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,200
difficult than that

1068
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
or am i missing an element of what

1069
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
you're talking about

1070
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
no i i think that's you know very

1071
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,280
accurate in these you know

1072
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,880
low probability

1073
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,400
over time they become higher probability

1074
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
but you know low probability high

1075
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,040
consequence events just

1076
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,359
become more difficult for us to

1077
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,440
conceive of and therefore take

1078
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,079
corrective action prior to

1079
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,319
you know them occurring

1080
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,640
as we get further and further abstracted

1081
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
from how these systems

1082
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,960
actually operate and of course in many

1083
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,720
systems today we have

1084
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,200
you know failed we have uh you know

1085
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,079
fallback procedures and and you know

1086
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,079
some manual overrides and things like

1087
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
that but you know over time

1088
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,400
the

1089
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,359
you know the big infrastructure things

1090
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,200
will look radically different right

1091
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,480
everyone if uh if elon musk and

1092
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
the world of renewables you know have

1093
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,160
their way

1094
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,520
there's

1095
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,720
less reliance in these in these mega

1096
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,280
uh production facilities and there's

1097
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,119
more self-contained everybody's their

1098
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,280
own power station and their own storage

1099
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
and

1100
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,839
that sort of thing but

1101
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,960
then of course

1102
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
each one of these things is also

1103
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,880
computer

1104
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
production transmission distribution

1105
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
storage those are all 100 you know

1106
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,000
general purpose computing controlled and

1107
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,599
interacting with all the other ones and

1108
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
so so there's really uh you know all

1109
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,920
sorts of of new challenges that are

1110
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,440
introduced that we're just going to have

1111
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,800
a hard time

1112
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,160
getting our

1113
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,119
our our minds around

1114
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,160
yeah there's a um

1115
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,200
there's an issue there of resilience

1116
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,720
in that if you have replication

1117
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,760
you are

1118
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,599
perhaps more resilient against single

1119
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
failure but not necessarily against

1120
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,359
common failure

1121
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,119
particularly if

1122
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,839
the people running those don't know

1123
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,480
i i think that's one of the things that

1124
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,960
i've talked about and

1125
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
you and i

1126
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,599
uh

1127
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,119
have a background in computing we're at

1128
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,720
one point

1129
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,880
early on in our careers

1130
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,119
uh

1131
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,480
although i'm not that's not to imply

1132
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,400
you're my age uh but but nonetheless um

1133
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,960
we were able to really understand at

1134
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
some level

1135
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,880
the operation of the computer basically

1136
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,760
from

1137
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,079
the power supply all the way to the user

1138
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,079
interface

1139
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,640
and uh the complexity that we've added

1140
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
the number of levels of abstraction and

1141
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,000
virtualization

1142
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,680
and distribution

1143
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,520
i i don't think there's a person alive

1144
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,480
who can

1145
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,280
uh

1146
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,160
actually understand more than about 60

1147
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,720
percent of that stack yeah at any one

1148
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,599
point

1149
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,280
and and that adds

1150
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,839
another complication to what we have

1151
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,839
as we get more specialized and it gets

1152
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,040
further

1153
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,480
further spread out

1154
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
we become more specialized in solving

1155
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,960
parts of the problem and not recognizing

1156
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
the bigger picture which again is

1157
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,079
something that you brought us here in

1158
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,359
this great talk

1159
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,319
is

1160
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,319
thinking a little bit beyond as to what

1161
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,280
the bigger picture may actually

1162
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
turn out to be

1163
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,640
well um we're not getting incoming

1164
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,800
questions so let me give you a a final

1165
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,599
one

1166
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,839
we have

1167
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,960
right now during this talk here live and

1168
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,839
also in the recording that we'll have

1169
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,319
a lot of students

1170
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,160
not just at purdue but

1171
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,520
around the world

1172
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,839
who will have listened to this talk and

1173
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,880
this discussion

1174
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,760
what kinds of advice could you give to

1175
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
them for

1176
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,839
what study what to think about

1177
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,200
what their futures are going to be like

1178
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,560
you've got an open mic and an

1179
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,319
opportunity to influence a generation

1180
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:54,930
here so

1181
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,440
[Laughter]

1182
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,599
well uh

1183
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,359
i i'll start off you know with my

1184
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,040
opening remark that i i completely

1185
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,280
missed the vision of the web uh when

1186
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,359
when it was first presented to me so

1187
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,200
don't necessarily listen to me but you

1188
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,720
know what i would what i would tell

1189
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,400
folks is

1190
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,680
you know

1191
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,079
when when i uh when i started getting

1192
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
into you know security was like the the

1193
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,280
early

1194
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,960
early 90s

1195
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,599
and it felt very crowded it felt like

1196
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,440
all the big problems are already being

1197
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
solved we've got

1198
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,240
you know firewalls and and we've got uh

1199
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,119
apples and we've got passwords and we've

1200
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,760
got antivirus stuff and we've got you

1201
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,560
know some early intrusion detection you

1202
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,400
know things are being discovered it

1203
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,480
seemed like okay well we pretty much got

1204
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,079
our arms around

1205
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,240
around security and then

1206
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,880
you know lo and behold you know 20 and

1207
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,079
30 years later the stuff is every bit or

1208
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
messier than it's ever been

1209
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,920
and while there are

1210
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,720
uh some some very well defined best

1211
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,760
practices of hey do this don't don't do

1212
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,640
that

1213
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,240
the world of security is still

1214
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
you know uh

1215
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,560
full of a virgin territory new concepts

1216
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,160
new ideas because how people

1217
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,359
compute and how people use technology is

1218
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,680
changing so dramatically so

1219
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,760
you know what i would encourage uh you

1220
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,200
know students

1221
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,920
uh to do is

1222
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,000
if you're passionate about the field

1223
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,599
you'll pull on the threads that interest

1224
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,359
you right there's so many different

1225
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,440
different aspects to com to computer

1226
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,960
security information security cyber

1227
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,119
security whatever we call it these days

1228
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,560
um you know pull on the threads that

1229
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,359
interest you and and that

1230
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,359
that uh that passion will lead you to

1231
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,280
places that uh

1232
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,560
that will lead to success

1233
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,359

1235
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,319
not only your talk today but the overall

1236
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,359
symposium on a note of of real hope i

1237
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,079
think and uh sometimes those of us in

1238
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,079
security are accused of being

1239
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,800
gloomy contrarians predicting that

1240
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,319
the death of everything but that's

1241
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,640
that's a very hopeful statement

1242
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
