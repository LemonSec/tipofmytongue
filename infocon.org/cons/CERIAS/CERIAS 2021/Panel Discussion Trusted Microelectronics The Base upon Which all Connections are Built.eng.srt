to uh be here on this panel um thanks

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
for inviting me uh donjan and uh you

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,479
know uh welcome all the other panelists

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,920
look forward to the to an interesting

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
discussion

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
by way of background

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,479
you know as

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
was mentioned i'm a faculty member here

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
in the school of electrical and computer

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,640
engineering

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
um i spent you know roughly the half

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
first half of my career

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
in the industry i was working for nec

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,160
corporation uh working on uh you know

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,239
among a range of topics um

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,720
relevant to this panel uh focusing on

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
security architecture of mobile

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
application processors so um you know i

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
was part of a team that developed the

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,239
security architecture that went into

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,040
three generations of nec's products so

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
learned a lot about um you know

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
concerns from uh security concerns and

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
how they permeate down to hardware um

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,519
through that experience

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
at purdue i've been uh involved in

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
various initiatives research

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
institutions since fall of 2008 when i

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,599
came here um notably now i am

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
co-directing a newly launched center

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
called the center for secure

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
microelectronics which is specifically

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,239
focused on

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,959
how we design chips assuming a zero

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,239
trust model

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
uh we'll be talking about that more i

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
assume um and i've also looked at

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
other you know security in the context

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
of you know other classes of embedded

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
systems like medical devices uh in my

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
research here at purdue so uh that's by

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,480
way of background um in terms of um you

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,798
know my thoughts um you know i think um

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
clearly the reason we are you know

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,959
there's there's multiple reasons uh

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
secure microelectronics is an important

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
topic today um one is of course uh you

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
know as from the perspective of end

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
users we would like secure computing

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
systems um you know a lot of it of

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,680
course starts with the you know

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
foundational security primitives you

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
know cryptography and all of the other

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,319
functional mechanisms that go into

102
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,480
making a system secure but eventually

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
they need to be embodied in secure

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
implementations um all the way down to

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
the hardware um so i think the hardware

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
can be both a source of vulnerabilities

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
part of the attack surface um as well as

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
part of the solution um meaning that

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
thereby that you know you can you can

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
actually build in um mechanisms in the

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
hardware that that prevent or help you

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
defend against software vulnerabilities

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
and software attacks

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
um

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,279
now more recently i'd say maybe in the

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
last decade or so there's been

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
increasing concern about the global

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
disaggregation of the

119
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
chip design and

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,759
fabrication chain so if you look at the

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,280
global footprint of a chip a

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
microelectronic system uh from you know

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
the acquisition of uh ip intellectual

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
property blocks that get you know

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
assembled into into a design into a

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
system on chip to uh the actual design

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
process and then the fabrication

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
packaging test you know

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
kind of you a chip might you know

130
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
see see if you draw trace a global

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,360
footprint of of the different entities

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,240
and and uh you know geographies involved

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
uh it's pretty global uh and so that

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
leads to naturally a lot of concerns

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
about um the potential for you know new

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
threats and new vulnerabilities being

137
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
introduced particularly in in critical

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,520
systems uh and so um you know at our

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
center that's one of the areas we're

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
specifically focused on trying to design

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
chips under a zero trust model for

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
example if the entity designing the chip

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
doesn't necessarily press trust entity

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
fabricate on the chip and so on and so

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
forth uh so i think that is an another

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,840
important reason why secured

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,919
microeconomics is becoming an important

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,800
topic

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
let me stop it there and hand it over to

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,440
my co-panelists

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
thank you

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,680
um

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
let's see uh sunil could we ask you to

154
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
make your remarks next yes absolutely

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
and i think uh first of all thank you

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,639
for this opportunity uh it's the first

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
time for me to uh come into

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,440
your uh uh a particular cirrus 2021 or

159
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
sarah's panel

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
and um anand i think you are absolutely

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
right um it all starts with uh the

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
hardware and uh what i always like to

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
say you know when we meet with customers

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
and that we try to design solutions

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
the hardware is either no matter how you

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
look at it it's either first line of

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
defense or last line of defense right

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
so when everything goes uh you know gets

169
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
compromised you go down layer by layer

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,520
and the layer where you have to take a

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
stand

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
and defend is is hardware right so if

173
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
hardware is compromised everything is

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
compromised and so uh briefly about

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,199
myself um i lead a

176
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,840
security architecture team at intel in

177
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
the network edge group and within that i

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
am part of internet of things group and

179
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
this is absolutely near and dear to us

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
because we actually um you know pretty

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,039
much internet of things group

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,840
um deploys products in the atom core and

183
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
xeon and

184
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
accelerators so very very close to us

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
and we have seen um you know requests

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
from our customers on anti-cloning

187
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,160
capabilities uh we have seen you know

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,120
certain silicon you know getting uh

189
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
kind of cloned and they showed up in the

190
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
markets we are aware of that too

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
uh we were in the in the middle of some

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
others uh other uh incidents as well

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
but when you look at all of those uh my

194
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,319
team is chartered with mitigating you

195
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,919
know the threats that are originating as

196
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,319
part of the iot and the edge

197
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
so it's a broader uh threat surface and

198
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
and uh and trust boundaries right

199
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
amorphous trust boundaries

200
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,440
and then at intel um what uh first of

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
all intel is invested

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
and leading the industry in hardware

203
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
supply chain assurance

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
with transparent supply chain now what

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,000
is transfer and supply chain that's a

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,199
service

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,680
that actually enables you to get it get

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
some visibility and also attain

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,120
traceability of hardware components um

210
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
and firmware

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
along with the systems right and where

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
is that where does that start that

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,599
starts in the uh on the factory floor

214
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,639
and

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
the pc and server manufacturers can take

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
advantage of that

217
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,680
and

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
not only that you can you know

219
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
enhance the visibility and attain

220
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,479
traceability you can also make sure that

221
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,319
the authenticity of the firmware is

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,479
ensured now we have other mechanisms

223
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,319
where at runtime you know you could use

224
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
verified boot uh measured boot or secure

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
boot as a whole to ensure that you are

226
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
booting you know firmware known good

227
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
firmware but how do you ensure that

228
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
first of all the the known good firmware

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
gets on the platform and stays on the

230
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,919
platform right so that's part of the

231
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,400
supply chain um and then some of the key

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,799
features of this transparent supply

233
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
chain capability include

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
the security of course cryptographic

235
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,159
verification of the authenticity and

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
then traceability um and again tying all

237
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
these all these measurements back to a

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
trusted platform module

239
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,760
that's how you type tether it back

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
and then the accountability where there

241
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
is a

242
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
something called platform data file that

243
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
that gets generated and that can be

244
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
used to verify against and that's the

245
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
last part that is the assurance part of

246
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
it right so and we have this service

247
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
available um for

248
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
let me see commercial core i3 and above

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
and all z on sp the scalable so you do

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,399
have these across uh you know variety of

251
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,040
platforms if you really want to test it

252
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
and so um that's that's what we are

253
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
investing in and we are investing in

254
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
some other things as well

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
but we can go into those as we continue

256
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
so you pause there

257
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
thank you very much

258
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,000
uh peter

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,839
we'll

260
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,640
yeah

261
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
okay so first of all thanks again uh for

262
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
the invitation it's an honor to be here

263
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
and i thank all the audience for

264
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,920
listening

265
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,320
so let me explain a little bit about my

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
perspective on trusted microelectronics

267
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
um so first of all i think joel kind of

268
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
alluded to this software and

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,279
applications all fundamentally rely on

270
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
having trustworthy and reliable hardware

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,959
so therefore

272
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,360
even if we're primarily software people

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
we still have to think about like how

274
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
the hardware

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
affects uh the

276
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
uh the capabilities that we have and the

277
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
level of security and trust that we have

278
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
and there are a lot of challenges in

279
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,839
this field i mean it's it's certainly an

280
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
open field

281
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
for both research and all kinds of

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,680
practical solutions as well

283
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
um so

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
a few examples uh include

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
you could call it kind of a group of

286
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
malicious type behaviors

287
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
and i'm sure you've heard a lot about

288
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
these in the news things like botnets

289
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,680
which often times

290
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
run off of devices that are not

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,839
completely secure

292
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,320
things uh internet of thing type devices

293
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
that have ips but don't necessarily have

294
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
a good way of having like uh updated uh

295
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
security capabilities or patches are a

296
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,079
big challenge and that can drive uh all

297
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,720
kinds of uh cyber attacks including

298
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
trojans uh distributed denial of service

299
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
and so on and so the fundamental

300
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
challenge there is that you have lots of

301
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,040
internet connected devices that are not

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
uh inherently secure so that is a huge

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
challenge it's not easy to solve it

304
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
because obviously that's not the intent

305
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
of the manufacturers but it can happen

306
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,480
and um having a better way

307
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
to patch those devices and otherwise

308
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
make them more secure is a open question

309
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
of how we can do that

310
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,600
in a way that's both

311
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
uh practical and cost effective and

312
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
and can also theoretically prove that

313
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
it's more secure than the current

314
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
approach

315
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
and so of course the most dramatic

316
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
examples that have come into the news

317
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
recently have been kind of on the

318
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,920
interface between software and hardware

319
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
things like cyber physical

320
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
attacks on infrastructure you've heard a

321
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
lot about the colonial pipeline

322
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
ransomware attack that was a huge uh

323
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
news story because it basically was

324
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
affecting like the ability of the u.s

325
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,839
public to access

326
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
uh gasoline and other vital supplies

327
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,519
right which are driven by the the

328
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
presence of energy right so it does

329
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
illustrate just how critical that is

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
and um

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,720
i think you could argue that this is uh

332
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
primarily like a software type problem

333
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,279
but you could also make the argument

334
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
that having like better hardware-based

335
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,279
approaches uh to securing those types of

336
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
systems uh could reduce the

337
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
chance and severity of those sort of

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
attacks so i think that is a big uh

339
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
open question for researchers again how

340
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,639
do we

341
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,160
make this

342
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
less likely to happen in the future and

343
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
that is

344
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
not something i'm going to answer today

345
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
but i just wanted to mention

346
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,279
that i i think that that has to be a big

347
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
priority like because it's in the public

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
interest

349
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
to secure those types of uh critical

350
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
cyber infrastructure systems and also to

351
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
just uh

352
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
reduce the chance that this could happen

353
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
in the future then there's a second

354
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,360
category of attacks that doesn't offer

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
sorry issues excuse me uh that don't

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
necessarily get as much attention but

357
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
are still important and you could kind

358
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
of call this like you know

359
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
rapid obsolescence or

360
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
unexpected failure and there are lots of

361
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
examples of this and uh one case where

362
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
this can happen a lot is when you take

363
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
off-the-shelf components that have been

364
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
tested in particular environments and

365
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
then you put them somewhere else so when

366
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,880
you put these

367
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,560
types of electronics into extreme

368
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,600
environments whether they be outer space

369
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
or

370
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
you know another planet or um even

371
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
somewhere on the earth that is uh fairly

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
different uh from a normal office

373
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,320
environment say like deep underwater

374
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
or in like a very low pressure

375
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
environment then lots of things can

376
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,360
happen that are unexpected and so being

377
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
able to understand what are the

378
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,279
mechanisms by which these failures can

379
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
take place and what are mitigation

380
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,160
methods uh to address them can help

381
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,320
um so just to give you a brief

382
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,639
explanation my background and what i'm

383
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
working on now um

384
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
i have led in the past this assure

385
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
program which was funded by indiana in

386
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
innovation institute im3

387
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
and it addressed three major areas

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
to address some of these hardware truss

389
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
gaps including developing novel hardware

390
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
that works in the xero trust environment

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
so that's related to what dr ragamathan

392
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
talked about ultra reliable hardware

393
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,399
that can survive these extreme

394
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,639
conditions as well as

395
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,000
anti-counterfeiting measures and

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
currently i'm leading scale which is a

397
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
department of defense funded project on

398
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,360
developing a workforce for students

399
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
interested in assured microelectronics

400
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
which has an emphasis on the hardware

401
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
side that also includes a component of

402
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
artificial intelligence and how that

403
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
relates to the hardware so thank you for

404
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,839
your time and i pass it on to the next

405
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,320
thank you peter and our next panelist is

406
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
dan walters so dan could you

407
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
give us an opening statement please

408
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
sure um i'm dan walters uh happy to be

409
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
here i'm an embedded security engineer

410
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
at the mitre corporation where i've been

411
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
for about 15 years

412
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
during that time i've taken on a number

413
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
of different roles from principal

414
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,880
investigator of internal research to

415
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
supporting um some of minor sponsors

416
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
directly across the dod and elsewhere

417
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
to protect their systems

418
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
one of my current roles is to lead

419
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,320
miter's efforts across the corporation

420
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,399
helping to secure the microelectronic

421
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,120
supply chain so i'm i'm very happy

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,360
to be here to talk about that

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
and i got to say i've worked on a large

424
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,279
variety of projects in embedded security

425
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,959
um many of which were really hard to do

426
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,519
but i think this this problem of trusted

427
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
microelectronics is one of the hardest

428
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
problems um facing our country and

429
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,800
facing the world

430
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
today

431
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
it turns out you know as hard as

432
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
building secure embedded systems is uh

433
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
it gets even harder when you when you

434
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,320
open up the the threat model um

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,959
what do i mean by that um yeah i like to

436
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,680
tease my colleagues who work in in cyber

437
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,759
security on more traditional systems

438
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,279
things like you know

439
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
desktops and servers and you know

440
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,360
networked systems because i say you know

441
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
your job's easy all you need to worry

442
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
about is attackers that have this very

443
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
limited scope they're going to attack

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
your system over the network

445
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,040
so you know secure your software and and

446
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
you're good and right and of course it's

447
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,279
not that easy but

448
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,320
when you compare a traditional system um

449
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,880
to an embedded system that threat model

450
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
it it really is true that it it's much

451
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,399
more limited with a with an embedded

452
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,480
system the types of things that that i'm

453
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
often working with i have to not only

454
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,600
think about all the software

455
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
vulnerabilities that that system might

456
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,639
have but also the hardware

457
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
vulnerabilities things that an attacker

458
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
can do if they have physical hands on

459
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
your device or can at least get close to

460
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
it and there's a lot of other things

461
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,400
that then you have to consider with that

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
so in that way when you open up the

463
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
threat model the scope of the things

464
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
that your attacker can do it really

465
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,640
changes the game from the defense

466
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
standpoint of what what you got to worry

467
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,839
about

468
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,079
and now you know you get to

469
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
secure microelectronics and what we're

470
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,200
talking about is really

471
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
completely opening it up because

472
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
almost every secure design is going to

473
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
start with some route of trust and

474
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,799
that's that's the base from what you

475
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,120
build upon right and so when you open it

476
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
up to say now i don't even i'm not sure

477
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,280
that i even have that route of trust

478
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
right because the the people that are

479
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
creating that are that are building my

480
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,880
trusted system for me

481
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,919
through the fabrication of the

482
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
microelectronics um are are no longer uh

483
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
trusted entirely to where i don't know

484
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
that the hardware that i'm building on

485
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,320
does what i think it does

486
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
right that that now becomes a seemingly

487
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
impossible situation to try to build

488
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,280
trusted systems on and that that's the

489
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,559
question how do you build this trusted

490
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,960
system if you don't trust the foundation

491
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
upon which it's it's built um

492
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
and you know unfortunately that's

493
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
that's the the situation that the world

494
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
is in right the supply chain has become

495
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
so

496
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
um consolidated into um where we

497
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,520
the whole world relies on just a few

498
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
entities to produce their their advanced

499
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,080
microelectronics um

500
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
and and it and it's really not as simple

501
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
as just reproducing that right we can't

502
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,120
just build more fabs here and elsewhere

503
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
um to to reproduce and and try to to get

504
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
to

505
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
you know

506
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
a self-sustained or self-sufficient

507
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
supply chain um because the market is

508
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,440
just so complex if you try to do that

509
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
you'll you'll lose a lot of money um

510
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
and so we need something more than that

511
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,320
um

512
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,160
and it's and it's really hard to know

513
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,520
what that is so i think that's what

514
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,200
we're going to talk about is what

515
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
what more do we need how do we get there

516
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
um

517
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
and looking forward to the conversation

518
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
thanks

519
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
uh let me just uh

520
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
make a few remarks here to help set the

521
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
stage little for some in the audience

522
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
who may not have the background in this

523
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,160
uh

524
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,120
when

525
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
when in particular when dan is making uh

526
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,039
note that

527
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,840
uh

528
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,799
it's not easy to set up a new fab

529
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,760
um

530
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
it's possible to set up a fab but at die

531
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,600
sizes or that is at the level of packing

532
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,039
on a chip

533
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,240
that

534
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
i'm 20 years old

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,160
to use the very latest technology is

536
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
incredibly expensive

537
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
both for getting the x-ray lithography

538
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,600
kind of

539
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,640
equipment in place that to

540
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
cut cut the masks for the chips

541
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
the purity of the material required the

542
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,200
clean rooms

543
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
the other kinds of processes involved

544
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,919
are extraordinarily expensive

545
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
and unless you are willing to continue

546
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,000
to capitalize

547
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,559
in this arena to build out your capacity

548
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
as you go it gets more and more

549
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
expensive a second point that was raised

550
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
here and you heard this from a couple of

551
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
the speakers has to do with supply chain

552
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,919
and where chips are made

553
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,520
there are some

554
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
selected foundries in various places

555
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,159
around the world and again it's not easy

556
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
to just create new ones

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,559
in a new locale not only because of the

558
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,720
equipment but for the expertise of the

559
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
people involved and there are

560
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,559
environmental issues because of some of

561
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,760
the waste

562
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
the water that's required for cooling

563
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
and other kinds of issues

564
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,640
so uh we have some companies that make

565
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,679
the

566
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,640
designs the masks that are for the

567
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
high-end chips that are then produced at

568
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,760
foundries that are run by other firms uh

569
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
under contract

570
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
so that adds to some of the complexity

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
of determining

572
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,000
if what is produced is actually what was

573
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
designed and of course then there are

574
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
the issues of the design tools

575
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,559
uh to give an idea here and this

576
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,240
actually leads into my first question

577
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,039
back in 1974 when the 8088 or the

578
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,240
88

579
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
but that first ship the 8080 chip

580
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,840
uh came out that intel had that had 6

581
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,720
000 transistors on it

582
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
the m1

583
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
max pro that apple just released has

584
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,200
almost 34 billion transistors on the

585
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,640
ship

586
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
uh

587
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
we know from

588
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
security studies that complexity

589
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,600
is the enemy of good security

590
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,280
and how to even test and assure

591
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
chips with that much functionality on

592
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,720
them becomes an incredible problem

593
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
and so i'd like to get some comments on

594
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,159
that now i'll ask sunil to lean on at

595
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,080
first because i happen to mention the

596
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,440
intel 8080 chips there and uh

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
we'll give you a shot at that first

598
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
yeah that's a uh that's a very good

599
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,120
question and i think that's the next

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,280
billion dollar or even trillion dollar

601
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,039
question uh

602
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
as we get into uh you know the

603
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,840
complexity uh i think

604
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
if you

605
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
start beginning to slice it um i would

606
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,159
say

607
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,200
at least

608
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
the way how we are looking at it or if

609
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,679
you know semiconductor manufacturer is

610
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
looking at it is it divided into

611
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
different phases right so when you look

612
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
at the life cycle or the supply chain

613
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
life cycle you have the design

614
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
phase right a conceptual phase followed

615
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
by design and i see and i think in the

616
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
design phase there are some things that

617
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,840
you can consider

618
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
you can look at a take a closer look at

619
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
the third party um you know plugins that

620
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
get into you into it the design tools

621
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
themselves and also get a good idea of

622
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
the insider threats is i think i would

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
say that's another thing

624
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,679
and uh the

625
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
um

626
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
we are also seeing that we could focus

627
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,559
on attack on the design um you know

628
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,440
networks themselves right so that's one

629
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,120
thing um so to to actually slice it and

630
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
then during the integration again there

631
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
is a focus on insider threats a thorough

632
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,039
threat modeling and then um there is a

633
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
there's an idea and focus on malicious

634
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
hardware of course and firmware that

635
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
also goes into it that's part of the

636
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
integration

637
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
um and then the

638
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
uh ability to detect any kind of design

639
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
alteration uh is another thing that we

640
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,520
are also looking at when we are again

641
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
slicing this right and unauthorized

642
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,039
disclosure is another uh part but but um

643
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,039
when you start beginning to get into

644
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,919
manufacturing phase in the life cycle

645
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
absolutely the trojan circuitry is is

646
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,880
part of it component replacement um is

647
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
also part of the complexity so

648
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,919
uh and we are even talking about the soc

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,080
within the soc i didn't even go outside

650
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,320
of soc here so there are many things

651
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,279
that you can look at in the

652
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,039
manufacturing right i just mentioned

653
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,600
couple again insider threats are

654
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
prevalent in the manufacturing and

655
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
testing phase

656
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
follows that and then you do have again

657
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
during testing you could have a

658
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
component replacement now this testing

659
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
could be pre-silicon emulation it could

660
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
be the hybrid emulation platforms uh it

661
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
could be the iep drag and drops that are

662
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,799
happening and then the complexity will

663
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,480
also get in when you try to provision

664
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
that is the next phase in the life cycle

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,520
and when you're configuring and

666
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,240
as the socs get more complex you know

667
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
system on chips

668
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
you now have to provision uh the

669
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
individual ip blocks within the soc

670
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,880
right the components within the soc and

671
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,679
uh that there you know you can introduce

672
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,760
um you know like there are insider

673
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
threats um and again you know uh

674
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
improper device settings is another

675
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
thing if you don't configure one ip

676
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,760
correctly and completely then that ip

677
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,440
could actually be used intellectual

678
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
property block within the soc could be

679
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
used as your trojan right you compromise

680
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
that and you leverage its um you know

681
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
properties and security you know

682
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
permissions to go attack the other ones

683
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
uh to attack the bus to attack the

684
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
fabric uh and deployment we we all know

685
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,880
you know there are different things that

686
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
can go you know wrong with the

687
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
deployment so the complexity is it's

688
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
actually spread out across these life

689
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,960
cycle stages and we have to slice it and

690
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,760
then uh go go attack them individually

691
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
or tackle them individually

692
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
yeah anybody else on the panel want to

693
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,039
say some things on this topic

694
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
i'm sure you all have opinions

695
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,559
sure

696
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
uh dan you would like to take a shot

697
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
right yeah i was just gonna

698
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
comment on you know the

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,919
the the complexity of the the chips and

700
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,640
how

701
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,200
um you know the the design process has

702
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
really changed you know going back to

703
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,720
the 8080 to to what we build today um

704
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,159
and that that's been enabled by our

705
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,120
software tools right so so today we use

706
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
eda tools to help us

707
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,679
design our chips these are incredibly

708
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
complex software tools that are really

709
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
good at optimizing the design for all

710
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
sorts of different performance

711
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,120
characteristics like power and size

712
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
but

713
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,919
they're not very good in my opinion for

714
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,919
optimizing for security i they don't

715
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,120
have um security built in in the same

716
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
way that they have these these other

717
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
things built in and so

718
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
um so the designers really i think

719
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,279
struggle with that and in some ways have

720
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,400
to fight with their tools so i think

721
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
that's that's an active area of research

722
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
right now and trying to come up with

723
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
ways to um to improve that um and one

724
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
that that i think is uh a good path um

725
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,600
that i i'd certainly support

726
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
anand you wanted to

727
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
yeah yeah i mean i i i think i you know

728
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
i think a lot of great points have

729
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,919
already been articulated so i'll kind of

730
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
step back and try to

731
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
summarize right so i think the

732
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
complexity is indeed mind-boggling right

733
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,080
when you have these tens of billions of

734
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
transistors on a chip and i think the

735
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
three points i'd like to make first is

736
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,480
do not try to boil the ocean right you

737
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
can't boil the ocean so be strategic in

738
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
terms of you know what your threat model

739
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,320
is and what sorts of threats you're

740
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,159
trying to protect against right when i

741
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,840
was security architect for you know

742
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,799
nec's mobile application processors um

743
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
it was like software attack software

744
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
attacks software attacks it were our top

745
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,640
three priorities because that was the

746
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,919
nature of the application right that's

747
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,679
what we cared about right and so but

748
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,600
then a different chip like you know a

749
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
chip that goes into a defense system

750
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
might be very different in terms of the

751
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,039
priorities so i think you need to really

752
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
understand the stakeholders throughout

753
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
the value chain um

754
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,919
for for in your ecosystem and understand

755
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,320
what is are your top priorities in terms

756
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
of the threats you would like to protect

757
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
against and that would limit your scope

758
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
the second is is divide and conquer

759
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,520
right

760
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,000
you may not be able to ensure that each

761
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
of those transistors or logic gates

762
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
in your chip is is

763
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,240
either not malicious or free of

764
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
vulnerabilities but start with that root

765
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
of trust you know um i think this dan

766
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,600
who talked about the root of trust so

767
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
make sure that that root of trust that

768
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,279
is is absolutely secure right and so um

769
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,559
concretely you know when we were you

770
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,640
know designing uh the

771
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,799
mobile application processors we were

772
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
you know this is back in 1999 2000 the

773
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
industry first to embed a programmable

774
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
security engine with an isolated

775
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
execution environment inside that soc

776
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
um and

777
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,880
that you know we went to great lengths

778
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
to make sure that that was secured to

779
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
minimize the complexity of firmware that

780
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
ran on that

781
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
processor right of course and put in a

782
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,240
full os and so on uh and of course that

783
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,919
in a limited sense allowed us to

784
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,360
insulate ourselves from the complexity

785
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,640
of whatever was happening on the host

786
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,159
and the rest of the system

787
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,240
um so divide and conquer and and then

788
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
the third is automate right i mean like

789
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,679
dan said i'm part of a program now

790
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,320
called the ace automatic integration of

791
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
secure socs funded by darpa um led by

792
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
you know synopsis and arm our team you

793
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
know they are part of our team um where

794
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
we are precisely trying to address that

795
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
problem at the soc architecture level

796
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,320
where through increased automation we

797
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
just reduce the possibility for you know

798
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
human intervention and therefore you

799
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,039
know

800
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
introduction of vulnerabilities either

801
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
you know advertently or inadvertently so

802
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,799
increased automation of course that

803
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,000
still means that you have to trust the

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
tools but hopefully that's a one-time

805
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,960
job of ensuring or validating the tools

806
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
so i think it's a combination of these

807
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,279
three factors

808
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,919
so can i add something real quick so

809
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,679
sure i mean these are excellent points

810
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,240
um i think i would just add that

811
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,320
there are kind of two philosophies that

812
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
i can think of like one would be

813
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,120
essentially design in a modular way so

814
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
essentially

815
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
to build up

816
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
from kind of the baseline of very small

817
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,799
functions make sure that they perform

818
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,279
uh exactly as intended under all use

819
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
cases essentially and so then you can

820
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,919
kind of like build up upon like existing

821
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,799
work

822
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,200
um so that even though you have billions

823
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
of transistors it's built from a much

824
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,039
smaller number of like high-level

825
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,159
components

826
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,799
and uh several of those may be trusted

827
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,039
but the other approach is to uh kind of

828
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
use this attack surface uh definition

829
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
and to really focus on like what are the

830
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,120
specific attacks that are the biggest

831
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,520
concern and within those attacks i would

832
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,919
say there are two major

833
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,159
types of like active attacks to worry

834
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
about there's

835
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
the active attacks where there may be

836
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,799
like

837
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
approaches that are trying to directly

838
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
cause faults it might include things

839
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,080
like using electromagnetic radiation to

840
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,279
try to

841
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,159
overpower or overwhelm your system or it

842
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,919
could be passive attacks like

843
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,559
essentially like side channel attacks um

844
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,080
where basically you're picking up

845
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
something that's happening in the

846
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,399
hardware that could uh affect

847
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
uh information that you're extracting so

848
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,799
for example you may be able to detect

849
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,720
that certain computations are taking

850
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,519
place

851
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,760
remotely even if you're not supposed to

852
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,919
be able to know that information like on

853
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,279
the network

854
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
and so those two different types of

855
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
attacks require like two different

856
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,640
mitigation strategies essentially and so

857
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,480
if you know that one is more likely than

858
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,919
the other that's very helpful

859
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,320
information to narrow down

860
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,880
and avoid boiling the ocean as dr robin

861
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
melton mentioned so thanks

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,919
let me um sort of

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,000
take a couple of these remarks and turn

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,440
them into a

865
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
an observation and a another question

866
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
we've seen in the software arena

867
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,840
some of the same issues about how do we

868
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
build a complex system and trustworthy

869
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,039
in the process and so part of it is to

870
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,000
have uh assured components that we're

871
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,519
able to put together

872
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
usually there are problems at the

873
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,960
interfaces or because

874
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
they're reused in environments where the

875
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
assumptions no longer properly match

876
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,519
what actually

877
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,279
is the use environment

878
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,799
and and

879
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,480
combined with that we're seeing

880
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,080
i think uh what what at least from me as

881
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,720
an observer of platforms over the years

882
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,840
um

883
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,960
there is a need for more and more speed

884
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,919
and

885
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
complexity in the hardware because

886
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,080
uh we're competing and we've developed

887
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
things in software some of which we move

888
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,640
into silicon others uh

889
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,519
that we just need more processors on a

890
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,840
chip to

891
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,679
execute and of course there's also the

892
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,960
push for

893
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,799
smaller die sizes

894
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,360
so there's this this rush towards

895
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,519
putting more on the chip

896
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,600
smaller die sizes which

897
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,799
as as you noted peter also opens up to

898
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,600
greater environmental uh vulnerability

899
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,080
for some things particularly in certain

900
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
environments with radiation and emf kind

901
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,360
of kind of faults

902
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,919
what we're doing is we're spending an

903
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,480
awful lot building up complexity

904
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,039
to probably make mistakes faster

905
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,480
um

906
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,799
that certainly happens in software

907
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,200
and and so

908
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,519
we've we've also seen a consolidation we

909
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,720
see fewer chips that are available to be

910
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,519
used

911
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,960
general purpose in a lot of systems

912
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,799
there's only there's only three or four

913
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,760
now that seem to be commonly used

914
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
and people are using those because

915
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,279
that's what's available

916
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,760
uh rather than pushing for

917
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
other kinds of custom chips

918
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
all of that

919
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,320
to say you know all of that as an

920
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,519
environment

921
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,600
we're now in a position where we have

922
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
only a few

923
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,080
uh

924
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
vendors for chips

925
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,799
few architectures

926
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,440
that everything depends on

927
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,200
and small changes like the covid

928
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,159
uh problems result in massive

929
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,599
disruptions of the supply chain

930
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,040
if a disaster were to befall taiwan

931
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,679
a very bad earthquake or a very bad

932
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,879
neighbor

933
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,079
that could have an extremely severe

934
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
impact on us

935
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,440
that's a different kind of security of

936
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
microelectronics

937
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,399
i i'd be interested in getting your

938
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,719
comments as to how do we insure against

939
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,119
that and how do we recover from that

940
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,760
uh kind of problem where we're putting

941
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,599
more and more dependence into a small

942
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,399
number of very complex items

943
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,359
so

944
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,639
is there

945
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,679
uh dan um this this in particular hits

946
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
embedded systems right now automobiles

947
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,918
are backed up for a long time for

948
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,040
instance um how would you like to take a

949
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,440
shot at that first sure yeah so i mean

950
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,359
there's a lot to unpack there but you

951
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,960
know i think one of the big points

952
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
you're you're touching on is um

953
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
you know our

954
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
access to

955
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
uh electronics when you know supply

956
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
chain is disrupted so you know and

957
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,680
that's really a separate issue from just

958
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,880
do you trust the parts that you're

959
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
getting right can you even get the parts

960
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,599
that you need

961
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,079
is is a whole separate issue and also a

962
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,880
very

963
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
important one um

964
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,839
and i would say you know the things the

965
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,520
shortages that were

966
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,880
were seen now due to covid are

967
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,839
are

968
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,320
hopefully going to be you know blips the

969
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,720
the market should correct those types of

970
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
changes i think they're they're being

971
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,280
caused mostly from from you know shifts

972
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,880
in consumer demand for things um and and

973
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,839
we'll see some correction um

974
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,440
but you know the types of things that

975
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,760
you said or you know natural disaster in

976
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
taiwan or things like that uh you know

977
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,480
that could have much longer term effects

978
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,200
and is and is definitely um a threat to

979
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,720
be concerned about and so i think for

980
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,359
for those things there's really only one

981
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,040
answer in that we do need some amount of

982
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,599
redundancy in the supply chain and you

983
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,599
know so at the beginning i i'd said well

984
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
it's not as simple as just trying to to

985
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
reproduce the full supply chain

986
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
domestically or elsewhere

987
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
but there is a need for that to some

988
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,000
degree and i think that's why

989
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,119
is that we do need some more redundancy

990
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
in our microelectronic supply chain to

991
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
try to address some of those access

992
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,240
challenges

993
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,119
yeah if i were to make a comment um

994
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,280
adding to what dan said i think the

995
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,880
other thing that can be pursued is a

996
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,000
what we call

997
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
a well-defined ip

998
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,599
or

999
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,240
kpi bound ip key performance indicators

1000
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,599
bound ip

1001
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
that you can manufacture um so you

1002
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,079
define what you need uh inputs and

1003
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
outputs of an ip block and certain kpis

1004
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,880
and then you you go after wherever you

1005
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,040
can produce it like redundancy the dan

1006
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,960
was saying i'm going one level below

1007
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,599
where you know we could that intel

1008
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,680
started pursuing as well uh and and

1009
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,079
everybody now it's organic now

1010
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,880
that uh the ip blocks could come uh from

1011
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,599
different you know foundries and uh you

1012
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,440
know you could bring them and drop it

1013
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
into your soc so that's another way

1014
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
you could mitigate some of the

1015
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,680
availability

1016
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,839
uh you know concerns as well

1017
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,160
but that's one path to definitely to

1018
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,560
pursue

1019
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,880
right right and so you're you're

1020
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,960
addressing the problem of not just

1021
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
the fact that the industry is

1022
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,720
consolidated but on top of that there's

1023
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,240
this problem of sort of like vendor

1024
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,280
lock-in

1025
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,359
right where there might be multiple fabs

1026
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,680
that could produce um a chip that would

1027
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,400
meet

1028
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
the performance requirements functional

1029
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
but

1030
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
when you design your chip you kind of

1031
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
have to match your design to where it's

1032
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,200
going to be fabricated right and so

1033
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,839
yes that's a big problem if if we could

1034
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,520
break the vendor lock and that would go

1035
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,320
a long way

1036
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,079
although that's not something that i

1037
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
think too many vendors would embrace

1038
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
yeah but i was just going to add that

1039
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
you know i i absolutely think you know

1040
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,359
redundancy is the way um you know out

1041
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,839
but it is an expensive option uh

1042
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,599
particularly when it comes to redundancy

1043
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,720
in the in the manufacturing uh process

1044
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
or manufacturing supply chain but it is

1045
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
something that we are seeing

1046
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
you know maybe increasing

1047
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,960
um acceptance of um because it's it's

1048
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
really you know i i believe that that's

1049
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,160
really the only way

1050
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
um you know uh cutting edge fab is you

1051
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,520
know 20 plus billion dollars uh we're

1052
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,480
seeing recent um uh initiatives like the

1053
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
chips are the use yusika i guess the

1054
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
chips and endless frontier ads you know

1055
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,240
really starting to address that through

1056
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,359
investment um so you know globally

1057
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,800
although if you just think from a global

1058
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
perspective that might not be the most

1059
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
efficient way globally for the industry

1060
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
uh it is a more robust way and you pay

1061
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,920
in terms of you know uh additional cost

1062
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,640
or

1063
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,720
per investment

1064
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,000
the other thing i

1065
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,320
remark i wanted to make was that uh open

1066
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,920
source design which is you know open

1067
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,160
source hardware uh which is starting to

1068
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,079
pick up again i i know it's not going to

1069
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,560
be an easy easy push because as pac just

1070
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
mentioned you know it may not be in the

1071
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
interests of everybody you know the

1072
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
various players in the in the computing

1073
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
industry but i think

1074
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
trying to democratize uh the ability to

1075
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
do hardware design in general uh could

1076
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,280
be could be a good thing at least from

1077
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,119
this perspective of of trying to build

1078
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,440
in robustness

1079
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
yeah i've been intrigued by seeing some

1080
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
of what the the spark project uh of that

1081
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
that architecture um

1082
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
although i don't see that being

1083
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,920
really embraced by anybody making it uh

1084
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,160
it's been a very interesting

1085
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,760
kind of effort to go through

1086
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,040
so

1087
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
the

1088
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
this leads into a question that i had

1089
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,359
about

1090
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,240
um

1091
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
again differentiation and and

1092
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,599
consolidation

1093
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,839
uh we

1094
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,400
have

1095
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
in the u.s so i'll limit it to that but

1096
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,079
we have uh need for trusted fabs

1097
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,440
uh locations where we absolutely uh

1098
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
have no doubts about

1099
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,560
uh insider threat that several of you

1100
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,839
mentioned

1101
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,359
and these are for

1102
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,560
um

1103
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,720
critical systems space systems

1104
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,720
communication systems of national import

1105
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,800
that's more expensive

1106
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,079
and because it's a smaller customer base

1107
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,079
it has a very different capitalization

1108
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,960
issue for trying to build those

1109
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
that's probably too expensive to do for

1110
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,920
mass production of chips

1111
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,760
but that brings up the idea of multiple

1112
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
levels of security which we have with

1113
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,160
software that some need to be more

1114
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,560
secure than than others higher assurance

1115
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
software and we're willing to invest

1116
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
more

1117
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,119
uh

1118
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,359
can can that model succeed

1119
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,160
in the current environment where we have

1120
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,280
such high capacity of chip demand and

1121
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
production

1122
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,319
that idea of layered levels of security

1123
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,599
with different levels of assurance and

1124
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,480
effort put into

1125
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,599
ensuring resilience of the product

1126
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,760
it can if i if i may start it can um

1127
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,640
give you certain you know immunity

1128
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,160
for certain you know temporal and

1129
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,400
spatially right

1130
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
but as you

1131
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,319
uh you know go

1132
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,800
and try to mitigate the more advanced

1133
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,839
threats

1134
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,160
um you know we have this concept of

1135
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
secure boot is where you your hardware

1136
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
root of trust

1137
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,640
starts authenticating by using that you

1138
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,960
authenticate your very first instruction

1139
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,359
that gets executed on the cpu

1140
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,200
and then that is where how you're using

1141
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
hardware to trust software

1142
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
now there is also this concept of

1143
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,280
software or firmware or software

1144
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,359
trusting the hardware right how does the

1145
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,920
firmware software know that it is

1146
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,200
executing on a genuine hardware right so

1147
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
if you if you can somehow

1148
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
you know tackle or tie those together

1149
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,839
yes the upper layers can handle certain

1150
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,920
threats and then you know at some point

1151
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,880
in time though when the hardware gets uh

1152
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,760
you know compromised then um during the

1153
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,680
next boot or if it's a static uh root of

1154
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
trust or dynamic root of trust during

1155
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,119
the same boot

1156
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,640
you could see

1157
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,880
the downward layers actually corrupting

1158
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,119
or tainting the upper layers and then

1159
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,880
your system goes down so it's only a

1160
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,839
matter of time you can get temporary

1161
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
um you know kind of uh immunity on

1162
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,839
mitigations it is what i think yeah

1163
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,000
anyone else wanna i realize that was a

1164
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,359
poorly formed question but hopefully

1165
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,480
anyone else

1166
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
um

1167
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,440
yeah i mean i so

1168
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,839
i definitely agree um

1169
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,839
with sunil um i think part of your your

1170
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,760
question though uh if i understood

1171
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,040
correctly is

1172
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,240
when you're talking about different

1173
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,839
levels of security part of that is

1174
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,280
you're saying well

1175
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,040
different levels even for the production

1176
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,119
of that hardware root of trust right so

1177
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,440
maybe we use a very expensive

1178
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,319
um

1179
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,520
you know trusted fab to to to build our

1180
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,680
route of trust and

1181
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,839
um and that's appropriate for something

1182
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,720
that needs it but um you know we have

1183
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,520
other fabs that maybe aren't as trusted

1184
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,200
um for for other things is that is that

1185
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
effectively

1186
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,760
um

1187
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
so in a software world

1188
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,040
using windows

1189
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,920
uh

1190
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,440
for command and control of nuclear

1191
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,760
weapons and for keeping your recipes at

1192
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,280
home

1193
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
is a little bit

1194
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
different in in nature and we don't need

1195
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
the same

1196
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,680
we shouldn't need the same system and

1197
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,560
the same level of uh assurance so

1198
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,880
similar with hardware

1199
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,000
right is that a commodity level pc

1200
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
probably does not need the same level of

1201
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,319
assurance

1202
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,720
as something that's going to go into a

1203
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,200
very critical medical or or national

1204
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,000
defense application

1205
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,800
does it make sense to distinguish

1206
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,280
those in the production environment

1207
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,000
and allocate resources accordingly i see

1208
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,319
yeah i mean i think it makes sense but

1209
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,440
also

1210
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,599
right we can't ignore that that's

1211
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
exactly the philosophy of the trusted

1212
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,040
foundry program

1213
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,839
which you know of course was was trying

1214
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,040
to

1215
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,800
put a lot of money into vetting certain

1216
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,119
foundries and saying that you know we

1217
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,200
we know there's not an insider there and

1218
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,119
you know this isn't appropriate for for

1219
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,480
everything but for the things that

1220
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,040
really need security you can do that and

1221
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
there have been a lot of problems with

1222
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,040
with that program

1223
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,200
not the least of which is that it's

1224
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,880
incredibly expensive so even for

1225
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
the systems that absolutely need it it

1226
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,839
can somehow sometimes be prohibitive and

1227
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,640
and

1228
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,319
it doesn't just always

1229
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,280
manifest in cost but also in that

1230
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,640
the trusted founders just don't

1231
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
necessarily keep up

1232
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,599
with the most advanced tech nodes um and

1233
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,119
because it the market forces aren't

1234
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,720
there to let them keep up um and so

1235
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,000
um

1236
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,680
you know it's

1237
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,720
it's it's hard to to look at that and

1238
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
ignore that and say that that's an

1239
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
approach that that can continue to be

1240
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,640
used going forward i think

1241
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,560
what we need to make something like that

1242
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,480
work is better ways to integrate

1243
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,319
so maybe

1244
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,800
you do have something like that for your

1245
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,119
your root of trust but you need a better

1246
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,119
way to integrate that root of trust with

1247
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,800
a piece that's untrusted that's built

1248
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,160
somewhere else that's the most advanced

1249
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,839
tech node root of trust doesn't have to

1250
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,200
be the most advanced tech node but if

1251
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,800
that then drives

1252
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,400
what the technology is for the rest of

1253
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
your chip and you you don't have a way

1254
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,640
to tightly integrate them

1255
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
then that becomes really limiting for

1256
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,520
what you can build in that in that

1257
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,440
trusted manner

1258
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,920
so yeah to add to that i mean that's a

1259
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,480
great point and i think just to briefly

1260
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,119
explain what is the zero trust method

1261
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,160
involved that is a method that dr

1262
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,079
raganathan alluded to

1263
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,119
and it basically means that you are able

1264
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,280
to source

1265
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,040
components from

1266
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,200
outside of like a trusted foundry type

1267
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
program but then you conduct extensive

1268
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,880
verification validation before you would

1269
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,000
include that in a more trusted system

1270
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,640
and so you're not trusting the foundry

1271
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
itself but you're trusting your process

1272
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,359
for taking that untrusted component and

1273
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,440
then confirming that it behaves the way

1274
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,319
that you expect before you put it into

1275
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,400
like an important application and

1276
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,880
obviously you don't do that for like a

1277
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,839
computer holding recipes for home use

1278
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,760
but you do do that for like something

1279
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,319
that's much more critical for you know

1280
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,520
health and safety or what have you

1281
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,280
yeah and one example that comes to my

1282
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,800
mind is the

1283
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,680
mcp multi-chip package where you can

1284
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,800
pair ns nsoc

1285
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,559
along with an asic or a cpld or an fpga

1286
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,280
and that fpga or asic would have this

1287
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,760
secret sauce that would bootstrap the

1288
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,880
soc

1289
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,800
and you know does the uh handshaking and

1290
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,119
you know enumeration and then periodic

1291
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,400
attestation so in that way you have this

1292
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,040
secret you know small smaller ip

1293
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,960
that is actually bootstrapping a larger

1294
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,599
ip that even dan was alluding to right

1295
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,920
where your soc you will not be able to

1296
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
you have to babysit basically right the

1297
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,720
soc for the security perimeter purposes

1298
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,040
yeah i i think heterogeneous integration

1299
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,119
is is one promising direction right and

1300
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880
advanced packaging technologies uh

1301
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,599
because um you know um

1302
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,079
uh it is becoming clear that it's gonna

1303
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,400
be very difficult or has you know become

1304
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,160
pretty much infeasible for the trusted

1305
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,079
boundaries to keep up with the most

1306
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,000
cutting edge tech nodes now not

1307
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,520
everything needs to be fabricated at the

1308
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
most cutting edge technology right uh if

1309
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
your root of trust can be fabricated in

1310
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,960
that older process that is supported by

1311
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,359
the trusted foundry and you can you know

1312
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,599
package it into a system uh and

1313
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,520
thankfully for other reasons right not

1314
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,920
necessarily relating to security uh you

1315
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,839
know for example you know amd and intel

1316
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,760
are really pushing uh you know uh to uh

1317
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
these technologies for for advanced

1318
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
heterogeneous integration you know in

1319
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,839
the data center uh you know server class

1320
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,520
processor context

1321
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,040
those lot of those technologies could

1322
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,280
trickle down and possibly be used here

1323
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,119
um and i think that's what sunil was

1324
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,880
alluding to i think that's an actually a

1325
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,280
very interesting angle to maybe look at

1326
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,119
further

1327
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,440
it reminds me in in part of the

1328
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
virtualization uh issue that we have

1329
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,920
where we put the trust in the virtual

1330
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
machine monitor and then we run all

1331
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,240
kinds of untrusted things inside of it

1332
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,079
um

1333
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,559
i i'd like to return to you part of uh i

1334
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,160
think it was dan's comment about um

1335
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,040
the expense that people

1336
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,839
it doesn't support the market

1337
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,319
is it possible that one of the problems

1338
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,520
we have

1339
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,480
is that customers don't understand the

1340
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,040
value of higher assurance

1341
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,079
and if they did we might be able to

1342
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,520
uh afford somewhat better methods or

1343
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,359
different methods

1344
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,359
um what is it what is about the current

1345
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,880
market that that could be different

1346
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,240
uh that's

1347
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,680
i'm asking you to speculate but

1348
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,240
um

1349
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,359
sure so i mean certainly um today's

1350
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,880
consumers do not uh care much about

1351
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,839
security i'll i'll just say it bluntly

1352
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,440
security doesn't sell

1353
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,400
um

1354
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,599
and

1355
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,480
it's

1356
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,520
it i don't think it's because um

1357
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,400
you know consumers are

1358
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,640
you know that at fault in any way it's

1359
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,880
it's a hard thing to look at a device

1360
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,800
and know how secure it is right i mean

1361
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,520
we

1362
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,319
a big part of my job is is often

1363
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,000
doing that and and it it takes uh it

1364
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
takes a lot of work to make a good

1365
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,040
assessment of a device's security um and

1366
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
so it's not reasonable to expect that a

1367
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,280
consumer can can make

1368
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,040
purchasing decisions based

1369
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,440
on on something like that um so it

1370
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,880
doesn't it doesn't sell um and

1371
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,760
i i don't think there's an easy way to

1372
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,400
get to making it to sell

1373
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,680
but yeah that would have certainly

1374
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,920
improved the situation

1375
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,960
one thing i could see happening that i

1376
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,599
hope will happen at some point

1377
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,040
is that

1378
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,480
security of

1379
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,640
electronics and computers in general

1380
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,559
go through something similar to what the

1381
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,920
automotive market went through with

1382
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,440
safety

1383
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,240
where

1384
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,880
you know more standards

1385
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,440
are created and

1386
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,240
tests are standardized to where there's

1387
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,880
a ranking system and it becomes much

1388
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
easier for someone to just look up just

1389
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
like people can look up uh you know how

1390
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,839
did this new car do on its crash test

1391
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,480
how did this new um phone do this new

1392
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,000
smartphone that i'm going to trust to

1393
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,640
store all of my sensitive data how did

1394
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,559
it do on its you know hack test and um

1395
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,800
you know if i can do that then maybe now

1396
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,839
i you know it can start to sell more um

1397
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,240
maybe insurance companies can start to

1398
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,920
look at that as well for things like

1399
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,040
ensuring you know big companies that

1400
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,480
that store your data in the cloud right

1401
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,559
so i think through

1402
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,319
through standards and tests and making

1403
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,359
that

1404
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,440
more easily

1405
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,520
available to a consumer and then also

1406
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,880
making it hit some of the company's

1407
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
wallets through insurance um that that

1408
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,880
could be a path but i think for for the

1409
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,119
automotive industry that took decades

1410
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,040
and so it's probably going to be a long

1411
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,200
path for for the same type of thing to

1412
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,720
happen with electronics

1413
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,480
we we've been hoping for the insurance

1414
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,040
company to rescue the software industry

1415
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,359
uh security problem for over two decades

1416
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,599
and it hasn't happened yet

1417
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,000
if i can take another view to this uh

1418
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
totally different view

1419
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,559
is where um you know we

1420
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,119
we should and we start doing the started

1421
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,160
doing the uh penetration testing at the

1422
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,200
architecture level at the rtl level and

1423
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,839
at the firmware level and the uh you

1424
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,040
know operating system and the

1425
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,599
applications level right so both at the

1426
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,480
ip you know ip block level within an soc

1427
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,079
and a system level

1428
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,359
and and we are just beginning to

1429
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,680
understand uh and qualify and quantify

1430
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,200
you know if there are any escapes

1431
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,000
security specific escapes you know what

1432
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,160
is the cost of addressing them after the

1433
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,960
fact right so you know a vulnerability

1434
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,440
you know gets manifested and then you

1435
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,440
actually now have to go go back and fix

1436
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,359
it whether it's a silicon stepping or a

1437
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,359
firmware change those are expensive out

1438
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,800
of metal stepping

1439
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,000
um

1440
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and what does that cost um you know and

1441
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,680
and something like that we are still

1442
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,440
feeling our way quality to qualify and

1443
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,680
quantify right but i think i completely

1444
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,440
agree with dan that unless there is a

1445
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,200
jeep incident for automotive that

1446
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,079
happened gpac that happened uh you know

1447
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,880
colonial pipeline is an it2ot wake up

1448
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,839
call

1449
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,480
um but still a small wake-up call i

1450
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,800
would say right a grid a major grid

1451
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,079
incident would be a a big wake-up call

1452
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,119
so

1453
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,280
unfortunately i think the industry and

1454
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
everybody is waiting for those wake-up

1455
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,800
calls for their domains right everybody

1456
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,040
is waking up at their own time

1457
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
whereas you know we have to take all

1458
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,440
those security postures into

1459
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
considerations when we design you know

1460
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,520
the soc the firmware and the and

1461
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,000
everything else on the top of it right

1462
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,680
we've got a couple of questions that

1463
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,359
have started to come in here as we're

1464
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,079
nearing the end of our time of course uh

1465
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,720
so let me um

1466
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,640
let me go through those

1467
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,800
um

1468
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,960
there are two that are somewhat related

1469
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,160
there's one

1470
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,839
uh could someone talk about the

1471
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,359
feasibility of a

1472
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,520
micro reference monitor or other

1473
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,559
component

1474
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,680
that could

1475
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,400
maintain an inventory of components and

1476
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,599
behaviors

1477
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,000
that could actually oversee

1478
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,280
and block

1479
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,480
uh behavior if it's out of the norm and

1480
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,400
that's related to another question here

1481
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,720
which is the idea of

1482
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,960
uh having different kind of ip blocks

1483
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,359
with different specific

1484
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,200
boundary capabilities

1485
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,599
uh that we could have an open source

1486
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,880
sock development uh kind of framework

1487
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
that a standard that would address

1488
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,400
interconnections

1489
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,200
uh

1490
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,000
data standards voltage and so on so i

1491
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,920
think those two actually can go together

1492
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,799
is looking at an architecture for both a

1493
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,920
monitor and for component integration

1494
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,880
um

1495
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,200
is that feasible and and what do you

1496
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,720
what do you see as the likelihood of

1497
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,919
success or something like that

1498
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,920
yeah so we i don't know if uh so there

1499
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
are some there's a technology i can

1500
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,359
speak from indian side of things called

1501
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,680
threat detection technology that intel

1502
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,400
uh created that actually lets you

1503
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,000
capture it's a machine learning based

1504
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,680
technology that lets you train on the

1505
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,839
known patterns of execution and then

1506
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,559
when there is an anomalous anomaly

1507
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,040
then that anomaly gets detected and then

1508
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,640
you know there is some uh

1509
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,119
something some policy enforcement that

1510
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,280
that you can definitely uh take all

1511
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,079
right

1512
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,240
so that's um that's one method and i'll

1513
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,439
pause for others comments

1514
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,400
on the second part

1515
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,119
go ahead peter there you go first

1516
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,640
oh i was just going to say that on the

1517
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,599
second part of that uh question about uh

1518
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,440
standards for uh

1519
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,920
open uh like sort of ip interconnection

1520
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,119
there are a lot of standards right

1521
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,440
particularly at the soc level um i think

1522
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,000
at the chiplet level it's emerging

1523
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,520
but certainly at the soc level there are

1524
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,680
open bus standards right or standards

1525
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,400
that you can you can design too

1526
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
and of course

1527
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,200
you can have ips designed around around

1528
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,160
those soc standards uh the most

1529
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,559
pervasive just historically because you

1530
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,160
know

1531
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,200
it's been

1532
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,880
the more i guess the most used in in ip

1533
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,599
based soc design is the arm like amber

1534
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,000
or axi arm-based standards but every

1535
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,440
company has their standards and many of

1536
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,680
them are open source so uh i think that

1537
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,520
that that is something that you know

1538
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
already sort of exists supporting

1539
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,680
interconnections what it could be an

1540
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,000
interesting angle is to see how security

1541
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,680
could be built into

1542
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,920
that interconnect fabric itself

1543
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,440
right if you look at for example again

1544
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,160
i'm familiar with the arm trust zone it

1545
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,880
layers security on top of the on-chip

1546
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,280
communication the interconnect

1547
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,520
by having you know it's dedicated

1548
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,319
signaling in there uh so that components

1549
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,760
could for example discern between

1550
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,440
transactions as being secured versus

1551
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,200
non-secure that's just the starting

1552
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
there's many many other levels of

1553
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,200
functionality right i think that's what

1554
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,799
sunil was mentioning you could imagine

1555
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,400
that interconnect fabric itself being

1556
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,319
intelligent enough to monitor the

1557
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,920
transactions going taking place between

1558
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,760
the different components and maybe you

1559
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,200
know detecting anomalies and even

1560
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,040
blocking off components uh you know and

1561
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,920
we

1562
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,280
at least in the research domain tried

1563
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,559
out some of these things

1564
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,480
back during my days at nec and so i

1565
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,240
think there's a lot of possibilities in

1566
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,920
in in that direction

1567
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,040
um

1568
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,880
and i think particularly when we get

1569
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,799
into the domain of provisioning ip i

1570
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,119
think that that can you know again the

1571
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,400
interconnect fabric can play more and

1572
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,920
more of an active role

1573
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,280
and have a richer role to play in

1574
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,760
security

1575
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
okay so that's those are great comments

1576
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and so i would add that uh there are a

1577
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
number of startups that are interested

1578
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,520
in kind of

1579
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,880
making it easier to develop open source

1580
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,200
system-on-chip designs which can include

1581
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,559
secure

1582
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,000
opportunities

1583
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,880
so

1584
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
efablis is one that comes to mind

1585
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,440
there's also like a lot of work on

1586
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,160
developing on a risk 5

1587
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,920
design platform

1588
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,880
and there's an open soc system architect

1589
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,960
work so there's a lot of work out there

1590
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,280
and i did also want to add

1591
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,520
that in terms of

1592
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,760
you know enforcing like a zero trust

1593
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,720
model um there is actually a nist

1594
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,079
publication

1595
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,880
uh and i think the number is nist 800

1596
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,799
207 and that was actually like mandated

1597
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,720
by the biden government

1598
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,520
uh uh in may 2021 as being required for

1599
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,240
u.s federal agencies to adhere to this

1600
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,920
protocol and you can look it up it's

1601
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,440
like open

1602
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,680
for the public to read and kind of see

1603
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,280
what the framework is and i think it

1604
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,520
could be helpful to understand like one

1605
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,640
potential implementation

1606
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,400
all right well i think we'd go a little

1607
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,000
longer we still had a couple questions

1608
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,799
but we have run almost out of time i

1609
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,799
wanted to give each of you

1610
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:21,920
um

1611
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,040
a chance to sort of do a 90-second

1612
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,119
summary along with what do you think are

1613
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,760
the top two things that we can

1614
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,880
do in in academia with industry partners

1615
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,480
to move this

1616
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,880
uh move this field along

1617
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,839
um

1618
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,280
so

1619
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,480
let me uh

1620
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,920
sort of go here

1621
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,720
and

1622
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,880
backwards order i think it was peter was

1623
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,920
the first one or the last one in the

1624
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,680
introduction so

1625
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,079
you want to take that sure

1626
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:52,799
so

1627
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,559
i would say in summary

1628
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,720
there are a lot of challenges in terms

1629
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,640
of developing

1630
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,280
trusted and reliable hardware it's also

1631
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,680
a very critical challenge to take on

1632
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,440
uh and of course there are a lot of

1633
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,160
opportunities here but i think that

1634
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,040
making it fundamentally

1635
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,599
more accessible to

1636
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,200
model the

1637
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,559
uh the most important risk factors and

1638
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
to work more effectively with

1639
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,000
open source and off-the-shelf hardware

1640
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,920
are going to be key directions and so in

1641
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,839
terms of research opportunities i think

1642
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,040
that's going to be

1643
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,559
a huge emphasis

1644
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,359
in terms of getting

1645
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,160
researchers in academia working more

1646
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,839
closely with

1647
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,480
the federal government and industry to

1648
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,680
develop uh solutions that actually

1649
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,720
have practical implications for solving

1650
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,400
some of these security challenges that

1651
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,000
we talked about today

1652
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,400
okay dan

1653
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,680
um yeah so that's a tough question um

1654
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,599
i'm thankful that i had a minute to

1655
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,920
think about this while peter was talking

1656
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,960
i think

1657
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,680
um so two things two top things there's

1658
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,880
definitely a need for just more research

1659
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,960
and developing new techniques

1660
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,280
that that go along with that that zero

1661
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,440
trust paradigm where you know you're

1662
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,240
you're

1663
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,680
um accepting the fact that your your

1664
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,520
your fabrication facility um might try

1665
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,680
to do something nasty to you but you're

1666
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,920
building in techniques that make your

1667
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,119
system resilient anyways i think there's

1668
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,520
there's a lot of room for

1669
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,599
developing new techniques in that area

1670
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,920
and in maturing the ones that we already

1671
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,680
have

1672
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,000
and so i guess i'd say my number two is

1673
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,040
as we do those things we work closely

1674
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,559
the the folks in academia that are

1675
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,160
coming up with these great ideas work

1676
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,799
very closely with with industry partners

1677
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,160
to make sure that they understand the

1678
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,440
practical

1679
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,760
issues that some of those techniques

1680
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,280
then create and and think about how to

1681
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,039
how to overcome those because i think

1682
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,440
there's a lot of great ideas in academia

1683
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,039
that have a hard time you know getting

1684
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,280
off the ground because

1685
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,359
we're not thinking about the full the

1686
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,240
full um i guess stack and and how to

1687
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,119
actually make these things practical

1688
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,079
thanks anand

1689
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,480
uh yeah i know i i'll i it's definitely

1690
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,599
a very exciting time to be in the space

1691
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,440
you know because of the broader

1692
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,760
interest both commercially and from you

1693
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,839
know the government and dod

1694
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,960
side of things

1695
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,000
um so i it is a very challenging problem

1696
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,520
for example i know darpa has been

1697
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,440
investing in the specific issue of you

1698
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,280
know how do you ensure that chips are

1699
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,359
free of trojans free of sight channel

1700
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,000
liberties for almost 15 20 years

1701
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,839
uh you know

1702
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,480
it is not a solved problem um i think it

1703
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,880
will require

1704
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,720
a cooperative effort like peter and

1705
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,319
europe too

1706
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,880
both across you know academia industry

1707
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,400
but also across the different players

1708
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,280
involved in the chip design process

1709
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,480
so

1710
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,920
i think um

1711
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,520
you know that's that's my comment uh you

1712
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,760
know sort of more broadly uh and i think

1713
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,960
one great example of of how academia and

1714
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,400
you know industry and the government are

1715
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,960
coming together is our csme center uh

1716
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,119
joel thanks for sharing the link to that

1717
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,440
center earlier on uh you know where we

1718
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,680
are you know really trying to work with

1719
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,520
both industry partners and stakeholders

1720
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,920
from the dod uh in

1721
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,599
both you know advancing research but

1722
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:26,960
also training the next generation of

1723
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,079
workforce that's something that we

1724
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,760
didn't address as much at the end of the

1725
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,599
day you know we need the next generation

1726
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,520
of designers to really be aware of

1727
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,839
security and uh you know

1728
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,359
build in or think about security as

1729
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,520
they're designing the next generation of

1730
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,200
hardware systems

1731
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,280
thank you and samia will you close out

1732
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,160
with your thoughts yes uh so um one

1733
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,640
thing that i want to all of us uh to

1734
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,559
focus on is the compute life cycle

1735
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,520
assurance uh cla as we call it right so

1736
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,039
that's what will

1737
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,680
uh get us to focus on all the phases

1738
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,920
right throughout the life cycle and then

1739
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,520
the other thing is we talked a lot about

1740
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,599
zero trust right so i'm not sure you

1741
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,119
know i want to bring one

1742
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,799
micro focus to it is ip to ip right uh

1743
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,520
how does within an soc if you take an ip

1744
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,559
for example

1745
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,200
if i would as we can assume that you

1746
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
know maybe when we when the associate

1747
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
gets attacked and the ip blocks start

1748
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,400
getting compromised

1749
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,280
let's assume that even if even 70 of

1750
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,920
them are still intact they can actually

1751
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,599
account and vouch for the other 30

1752
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,640
percent bad actors right so some

1753
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,480
establishing zero trust and maintaining

1754
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,039
it between the ip blocks within an soc

1755
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,280
is something that that's really rich for

1756
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,039
you know research right right for

1757
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,920
research and then

1758
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,160
the other thing is if there are any

1759
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,960
ideas innovative ideas for example the

1760
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,039
compiler problem today right so how do

1761
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,160
we even for a software land how do we

1762
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,000
how do you know that the compiler is not

1763
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,240
producing right buggy code right

1764
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,559
intentionally right and so the same

1765
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,480
problem goes along with these other tool

1766
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,920
chains and everything in the hardware

1767
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,839
side rtl right

1768
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,520
you know there are tools that actually

1769
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,880
you know check the rtl how do you know

1770
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,280
that the tool is not compromised itself

1771
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,200
how do you check the tool so there

1772
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,400
there's got to be some formal

1773
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,880
methodologies that that we should work

1774
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,160
together

1775
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,079
to make sure that we can check the

1776
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,160
checker right or check the compiler or

1777
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,039
things like that so yeah

1778
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,960
all right well thank you all this is a

1779
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,799
fascinating topic and i know we can go

1780
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,119
on longer but we have to stay on

1781
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,039
schedule so let me turn it back to joel

1782
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,079
you
