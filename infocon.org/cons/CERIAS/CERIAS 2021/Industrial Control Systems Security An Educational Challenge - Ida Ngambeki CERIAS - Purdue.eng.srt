4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
butchered her poor last name and it's

hello thank you

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,520
one of these days you're going to get it

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
on the first try joel i believe in you

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
i welcome the opportunities i always

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
enjoy your speech

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
okay let me see if i can share my screen

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
here

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
all right can you see that

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,000
looks great okay thank you all right so

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
today i'm going to talk very briefly

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
about industrial control systems

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,000
security and the educational challenge

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
posed by this field

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
and um my talk is going to be based on

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
work that i actually did with staff so

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
eugene stafford and i collaborated on a

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,040
project to develop a curriculum guidance

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
document for a hub and spoke system to

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
help address the industrial control

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,119
system security lack

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
but i'm also going to talk about work

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
that we did with our graduate students

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
we had four grad great wonderful

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
graduate students on this project and

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
also some work i did with sean mcbride

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
at idaho state university

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,159
okay

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
so um

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
basically what we found here was that

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
industrial control system security is a

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
problem it's a massive

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
problem

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,119
right

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
um

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,119
before we start i want to

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,360
define some terms because

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
going through this what i've found is a

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
lot of people in the cyber security

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
space are really not that familiar with

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,560
industrial control systems

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
and so when we talk about industrial

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
control systems i think sort of the root

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
of it is industrial processes which

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
basically involve the use of machinery

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
and equipment

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
to create physical goods

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
usually in bulk quantities so things

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
like motors temperatures pressures

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
levels flows all of those things

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,840
are what we consider industrial

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,720
processes right

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
and industrial automation

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
is the field that deals with the

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
creation and application of technologies

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
that perform these industrial processes

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
while minimizing human oversight and

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
intervention right so that's sort of the

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
purpose we want as few humans as

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
possible we want these systems to be

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
able to run on their own we want them to

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
be able to be robust and resilient

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
and so there's operational technology

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,840
which encompasses the communication and

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
control systems used to automate

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,280
manipulate or acquire information

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,319
and

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
this is different from information

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
technology which i think most of us are

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
much more familiar with that deals with

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
data

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
operational technology deals with

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
industrial processes and

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
when we talk about operations we're

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,159
talking about scada we're talking about

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,720
ics systems so operational technology or

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
ot tends to be

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
used as the most broad umbrella term

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
here

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
industrial control systems is used

93
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
interchangeably with operational

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
technology they're not exactly the same

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
thing

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,799
ics refers to the equipment that enables

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
industrial automation

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
so programmable controllers sensors

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,440
human machine interfaces scada servers

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
so it's it

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
it's very similar ot but it doesn't

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
incorporate that

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
focus on networking technologies right

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,799
but when we talk about

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,879
industrial control systems

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
there's another school of thought that

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
basically says that equipment used to

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,519
manage

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
a multitude of computerized systems

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
which interact with the physical world

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
right so there are those camps who think

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
of industrial control systems as those

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
systems that are used in industrial

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
processes those systems that are used

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
to control things like manufacturing oil

116
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,918
and gas processing water distribution

117
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
right and then there are those who widen

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
the term industrial control systems to

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,080
think to include things like the

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
electrical grid

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
right

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
information technology i think we're all

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
familiar with computers networking

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
equipment software that

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
basically supports decision making

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
right it provides us with information

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
so what we're talking about the focus

128
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
of our project was industrial control

129
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
systems security

130
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
also referred to as industrial cyber

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
security

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
and basically these are efforts to

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
ensure the safety reliability

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
controllability functionality and

135
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,680
robustness of industrial control systems

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
and operational technology

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
so we wanted these are the systems this

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
is the field that is going to make sure

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,160
that in the face of threats in the face

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
of vulnerabilities the computerized

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
systems and networks these systems these

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
industrial processes can continue to run

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,199
so that's what we're talking about here

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,800
and the challenge

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,919
that

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,520
that where

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
we're focusing on is when you look at

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
this you find that

149
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,880
industrial control system security is a

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,039
major economic and national security

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
problem i think we all know we've been

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
hearing all day cyber security one of

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
our primary national security issues

154
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,160
icss is a subset of that

155
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,039
and

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
it shows up in so many ways right i

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
think the the most famous was sort of

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
the colonial pipeline

159
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
um

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,520
disaster i think we all heard about

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
which was a ransomware attack on the

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
colonial pipeline that um

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
provided

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
oil and gas to over

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,720
um over 17 states were affected by this

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
ransomware and the company ended up

167
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,520
paying

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,600
something like four million dollars to

169
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
get their operation systems back up and

170
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
running again right and they're more and

171
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
more and more of these attacks

172
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
every year

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
right it's definitely increasing

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,400
exponentially

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
and if you talk

176
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,639
to companies you talk to

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
ceos and cios

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
88

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
reported in 2019

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,880
that

181
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,759
this is 88 of ceos at companies

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
responsible

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
for um industrial control systems

184
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
companies that use industrial control

185
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
systems on a daily basis for their

186
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
operations

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,479
they were

188
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
concerned about cyber attacks most of

189
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
these companies consider industrial

190
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
control systems amaze industrial control

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
system security a major priority right

192
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
um 66 of these ceos and cios actually

193
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
said they expect to be victims

194
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
of an industrial control system cyber

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,199
security attack within the next three

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,080
years

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
that could result in a catastrophic

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
event right and these threats are not

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
reducing these starts are actually

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
increasing they've increased 2 000

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
in just the last three years which is

202
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
slightly ridiculous

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
so i think we can all agree it's a major

204
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
economic problem it's a major national

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
security problem

206
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,800
and in order to deal with this problem

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
we need people

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
in the workforce pipeline we need people

209
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,639
trained

210
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
we need people

211
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,360
with the skill set to be able to

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
design secure systems to secure the

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
systems that already exist

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
and make sure that they can hold up to

215
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
these cyber attacks and if they do fall

216
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
victim to these cyber attacks we need

217
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
systems that will be resilient right

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,199
that can recover

219
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,759
from these attacks

220
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
but there is a decided lack of talent

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
in this sphere in the workplace

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,000
right

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,520
the current national education

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
curriculum lacks essential

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
programs in industrial control system

226
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
security if you look at cyber security

227
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
generally

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,759
82 percent of employers reported the

229
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
cyber security skills shortage

230
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,639
71 believe this

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,599
um this talent gap that exposes their

232
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,560
institutions their companies to harm

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
right

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
so just to keep up with current demand

235
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,120
they're currently almost half a mil

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
half a million open cyber security

237
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,159
positions just in the united states

238
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,080
right the cyber security workforce needs

239
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,919
to grow 89 percent to keep up with

240
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,000
demand in the us 100 and 45 globally

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
right

242
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,279
so what portion of that is industrial

243
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,839
control system security it's kind of

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,040
hard to say

245
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
we can say about 60

246
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
our jobs in

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
operations and maintenance and secure

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
provisioning which is sort of the area

249
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
that would

250
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,839
encompass

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,279
icss

252
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
so

253
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
i think it would be reasonable to

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,320
estimate that about half of that 60

255
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
is directly

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
icss jobs so that's a significant

257
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
proportion

258
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
of the lack of talent in the cyber

259
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
security workforce is because of this

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
lack

261
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
of industrial control system security

262
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
professionals

263
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
right so we have this major economic and

264
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
national security problem

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
we have a lack of talent

266
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
that is able to deal with this problem

267
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
in the workforce pipeline

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
so

269
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
where does that leave us

270
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
right that leaves us with

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
looking at the beginning of that

272
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
pipeline looking at training and

273
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
education and saying okay obviously

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
there is a problem there obviously we

275
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
are not educating enough people we are

276
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,040
not educating them well enough

277
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
to make sure that they are able to enter

278
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,600
into this space right so it's very clear

279
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
that our current educational efforts are

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
insufficient to address the talent gap

281
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,760
in industrial control system security

282
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
so

283
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
we have taken some time and looked at

284
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
what

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
that at what the educational landscape

286
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,839
looks like and where the source of this

287
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,079
problem might be and there are various

288
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,720
places that i'm going to talk about them

289
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,839
right

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,399
one of the first places that we looked

291
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
was the curriculum guidance

292
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
right

293
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
every educational program starts with

294
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
building a curriculum that's going to

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
guide the ways in which we educate our

296
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
students right

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
in cyber security we have

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,279
three

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
primary curriculum guidance documents

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,880
you might all be

301
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
hopefully all of you are familiar with

302
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,200
them um there is the nice cyber security

303
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,079
workforce framework there is the csec

304
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
2017

305
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
and the um cie

306
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
um

307
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
the centers of academic excellence in

308
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
cyber defense knowledge units

309
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
so these are

310
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
there are others but these are the three

311
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
that are most referred to the three that

312
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,320
are most used so these are the three

313
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
that we took a look at to see where we

314
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
stand what kind of guidance is available

315
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
right so let me start with the nice

316
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
framework for those of you not familiar

317
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
with the nice framework

318
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,680
the nice framework was developed

319
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
originally i believe it was 2012 when it

320
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
was first published

321
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,440
um

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
developed by the national initiative for

323
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
cyber security education

324
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,120
led by the national institutes of

325
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,399
standards and technology and the idea is

326
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
to look at the cyber security workforce

327
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,839
the cyber security landscape

328
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,480
and describe and categorize cyber

329
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,959
security job functions

330
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,279
right they've obviously been revisions

331
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,800
on this document i believe the latest

332
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,279
revision was was published last year

333
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
right but basically the core of the

334
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
document describes the work roles

335
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,399
expected or envisioned in cyber security

336
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
and the knowledge skills and abilities

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
that are needed to perform those work

338
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
roles successfully

339
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,440
okay so it's a very useful document

340
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,399
and

341
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,680
a review of the framework actually shows

342
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,519
very little attention to industrial

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
control systems in fact the term

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
industrial control systems

345
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
is not in this document at all

346
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,760
right

347
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,279
the term scada which is sort of a subset

348
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
of ot

349
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
um appears in

350
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,399
three

351
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
of the ksas this is the knowledge skills

352
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
and ability statements so they're

353
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
you know over a thousand of these and

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
only in three of these

355
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
only three times does that specific and

356
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
possibly the most common reference to

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
industrial control

358
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
um appear

359
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
if you look at anything related to

360
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
critical infrastructure or other terms

361
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
that could be argued to be relevant to

362
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,839
industrial control systems you get

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,399
a handful of knowledge skill and ability

364
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
statements right

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,720
so we were curious

366
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
as to

367
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
whether this was sufficient for what we

368
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,279
were seeing in industry so we did a

369
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
really small study we looked at the five

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
most um popular

371
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
job search websites

372
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,279
and we looked for basically

373
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
we looked for jobs related to ics

374
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
security so this was automation and

375
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
robotic security operational technology

376
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
security

377
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
industrial control systems security

378
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
cyber security analysts in industrial

379
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
control

380
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
you know we used a whole bunch of

381
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
keywords to search and then we looked at

382
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
all of the

383
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
um job calls that we had found

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
and

385
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
we narrowed this down

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,680
right to what were the actual work roles

387
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
we're looking at and we came up with 10

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
distinct work roles

389
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
for each of those work roles we looked

390
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
at the knowledge skills abilities we

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
looked at the tasks the work tasks

392
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
and so i just wanted to show you what we

393
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,959
found in terms of knowledge statements

394
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
now you can see from these

395
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,199
these as compared to

396
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,600
if you map these back to the nice

397
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
framework they're very different the

398
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
nice framework

399
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
actually only about less than a third of

400
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
these are

401
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
just general cybersecurity

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,040
statements right the majority of them

403
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
are highly specific

404
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
to industrial control systems so

405
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
somebody would need specific knowledge

406
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
of both it and ot in order to be able to

407
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
complete these tasks and not just ip or

408
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
ot but actually the integration of the

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
two

410
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
so obviously in industry there is a

411
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
and a desire

412
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,760
for these work roles right so for people

413
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
who are

414
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
educated trained um competent

415
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,959
in their ability to carry out industrial

416
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,440
control systems security work

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
okay

418
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
the second curriculum guidance document

419
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
we looked at is called

420
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,560
the curriculum guidelines of

421
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
post-secondary degree programs in cyber

422
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
security affectionately known as the

423
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
csec 2017

424
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
this document was um created by a joint

425
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
task force composed of the association

426
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,519
for computing machinery so the acm the

427
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,480
ieee computer society and the

428
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
association for information systems

429
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,040
um

430
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
the special interest group on

431
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
information security and privacy

432
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
i think i got that right right and then

433
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
also the international federation for

434
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,959
information processing their technical

435
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
committee on information security

436
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
education so a lot of notable academic

437
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,600
and professional organizations came

438
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,880
together they contributed um experts

439
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
to look at

440
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,959
what are

441
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,119
the

442
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
what are the components of a cyber

443
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
security

444
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,839
program

445
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
what does a society what does cyber

446
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
security as an academic discipline

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
look like

448
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
right

449
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
so they did a whole bunch of workshops

450
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
they did online surveys they talked to a

451
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,839
lot of people

452
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,600
and

453
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
as i recall to make over 300 people

454
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
consulted on this and what they came up

455
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
with was these eight knowledge areas

456
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,560
which break down into knowledge units

457
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
topics and learning outcomes

458
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
right and the purpose was to represent

459
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,279
the full body of knowledge within the

460
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
field of cyber security that's what the

461
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,639
csec 2017 does

462
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
looking at industrial control looking

463
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
for industrial control systems within

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
this document

465
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,800
the term industrial control systems

466
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
appears as a topic

467
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,799
under the knowledge area system security

468
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,640
right so if you look at a topic you

469
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,919
start with a knowledge unit then that

470
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
breaks down to knowledge area and then

471
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
this is a topic

472
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,839
right so topic you can think of it

473
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,079
as of like a module

474
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,359
right so under system security

475
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
right and

476
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
scada is included under that

477
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
the term um cyber physical systems

478
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
appears as a topic under organizational

479
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
security again

480
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
a very limited treatment

481
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
right

482
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,760
so compare this to what we found in

483
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,440
terms of what industry is looking for

484
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,320
this treatment would not be enough for

485
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,760
somebody who wanted to go into a role in

486
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
icss

487
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
okay

488
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,280
um if you look at the nsa cae knowledge

489
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,919
units this is prob this probably has the

490
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,160
most comprehensive treatment of the

491
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
three when it comes to industrial

492
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
control systems it's actually an entire

493
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
knowledge unit

494
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
that is dedicated to industrial control

495
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
systems

496
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,840
right

497
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
and

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,679
it actually lays out learning outcomes

499
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,880
and

500
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,039
topic areas right

501
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,919
however if you really examine the topic

502
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,320
areas included

503
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,520
um

504
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
they're not really fully representative

505
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
of what a professional

506
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,559
in icss would need to know and need to

507
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,000
be able to do to be successful

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
right

509
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,360
so just looking at the curriculum

510
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,760
guidance documents it's obvious that

511
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
there is a problem we have a bit of a

512
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
challenge

513
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
here there is not enough curriculum

514
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,640
guidance to actually create a full

515
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
program industrial control system

516
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
security

517
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
right

518
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
so not only are the curriculum guidance

519
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
documents

520
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
um insufficient if you look at the

521
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,880
landscape of what actually exists right

522
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
so we did

523
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
a nationwide review

524
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,000
and we tried to identify every

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
industrial control system security

526
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,080
program

527
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,440
certification

528
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
right

529
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
so we looked for operational technology

530
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,240
security industrial control system

531
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
security industrial cyber security

532
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
industrial engineering technology

533
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
security automation and robotic security

534
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
right we use a lot of terms

535
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
and we came up with

536
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,880
there are very limited set

537
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
right

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,559
the most that we found were industrial

539
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
training programs in cyber security

540
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
that were specific to industrial control

541
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,559
systems right so giac has a bunch of

542
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
certifications in response industrial

543
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,000
defense critical infrastructure

544
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
protection

545
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,679
um global industrial cyber security

546
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,919
right that are specific to industrial

547
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
cyber security cisa has a bunch of

548
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
programs

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
um to train people

550
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
in ics cyber security

551
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
um isa has a handful right

552
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
but basically what we found

553
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,600
a lot of programs in cyber security a

554
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
lot of training in operational

555
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
technology and industrial control

556
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,679
systems but actual industrial control

557
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
systems security

558
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
we found less than 20 training programs

559
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
and these training programs vary from a

560
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
few hours

561
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
to basically a few months right

562
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,400
we found less than 10 university

563
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
certificates

564
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
these certificates were anywhere from a

565
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,120
few weeks

566
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
to uh a year

567
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,000
and we found exactly one degree

568
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
one bachelor's degree

569
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,320
it is at it's a four-year degree in

570
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
industrial control system security i

571
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
believe it's called

572
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,640
industrial cybersecurity engineering

573
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,280
technology i believe is what it's called

574
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
um and it was the only one

575
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
that we could find

576
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
right so obviously

577
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,480
there is a bit of a lack

578
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
right there

579
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
so

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
there is i think we can agree an

581
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,679
educational challenge when it comes to

582
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,480
industrial control system security right

583
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
so what we proposed as a solution

584
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,159
is the creation of a program of programs

585
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,000
basically we need many more in

586
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
industrial control system security and

587
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
we need to create curriculum guidance to

588
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,919
help support the development of those

589
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
programs so that is what we undertook to

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,240
do

591
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
basically the plan was to define the

592
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
need i think you we can agree the need

593
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,400
for this is very clear

594
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
we have ongoing cyber attacks we have

595
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
these systems becoming more networked

596
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,280
and therefore more vulnerable

597
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960
uh we have a talent gap right we looked

598
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
at the current landscape and we find

599
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,080
that there is definitely not enough

600
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
education and training we have looked we

601
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
looked and identified what existing

602
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
curriculum and existing curriculum

603
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,600
guidance

604
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
was available

605
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
so our next step was to actually

606
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
identify

607
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
critical knowledge skills and abilities

608
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
that are actually necessary to become

609
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
proficient in industrial control system

610
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
security

611
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,000
in order to do that we undertook a

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,360
delphi study so basically um we reached

613
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,760
out to there is a national

614
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,520
industrial control systems community of

615
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,159
practice that's actually housed at

616
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
the idaho national labs

617
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
i'm a member of that and i think staff

618
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
is too a few other people might be as

619
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
well

620
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,559
and they have some working groups that

621
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,640
are working on developing resources

622
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
developing standards

623
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
and training and so on industrial

624
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,760
control system security but um it's

625
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
professionals from academia government

626
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
and industry we reached out to them

627
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:51,919
and

628
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,520
we asked them this question what is the

629
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
critical knowledge skills and what are

630
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
the abilities that you need when to be

631
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
successful in icss

632
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
and based on that and based on their

633
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,120
feedback we developed a concept map

634
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,639
which you can see here

635
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
this concept map shows what they felt

636
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
were sort of the core

637
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
topic areas the core skills areas

638
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
in industrial control system security

639
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,600
the second thing we did was we ident we

640
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,120
tried we took

641
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,559
that concept map and we tried to look at

642
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
existing programs and see what

643
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
were the gaps

644
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,640
right

645
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,039
the project we're working on was founded

646
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,280
was funded by the department of homeland

647
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,720
security uh in collaboration with

648
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
um researchers at the university of

649
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
illinois out of verna champaign

650
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,440
and so they asked us actually to take a

651
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
hub and spoke approach

652
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
to this

653
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
and so we focused on

654
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
fema region five because that's our fema

655
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,679
region and the six states illinois

656
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,279
indiana minnesota

657
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,840
michigan

658
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,200
wisconsin right in that fema region we

659
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,960
looked at a whole bunch of institutions

660
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,679
and basically um we surveyed these

661
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,799
schools and looked for

662
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,520
what existing programs they had

663
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
most of them had some form of cyber

664
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,559
security everything from a full degree

665
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,520
to you know a course or modules within

666
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,679
courses in cyber security or information

667
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,799
security

668
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,640
most of them had

669
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,600
fairly decent engineering programs

670
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,919
some of them had engineering technology

671
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,200
programs

672
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
and so

673
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
between all of these so cyber security

674
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,400
management forensics network security um

675
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
engineering

676
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
technology electrical engineering

677
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
industrial engineering right so we

678
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
looked at all of these and tried to

679
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
identify okay so if you would if you

680
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,159
wanted to create a program industrial

681
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
control system security what do these

682
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,039
things have and what's missing

683
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,840
right

684
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
and what we

685
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
realized these are

686
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,240
the concepts that across

687
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
the majority of these are missing

688
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
right there's some places that don't

689
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
have enough cyber security they will

690
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,520
need to build that up some places that

691
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,799
don't have

692
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,720
enough um

693
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
electrical engineering right they need

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
to be fed up but broadly speaking what

695
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,520
was missing

696
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,960
was topics on safety on industrial

697
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
operations on instrumentation and

698
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
control

699
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,039
and especially on security integration

700
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,840
and what we've realized is that

701
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
any program in industrial control system

702
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,440
security

703
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
would need to be

704
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,919
ideally interdisciplinary

705
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,840
more realistically multidisciplinary

706
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
right they're going to cross multiple

707
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
departments

708
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,840
um

709
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,679
and they're going to have to be some new

710
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,400
classes created in these areas in order

711
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
to fill in the gaps

712
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
that we're missing

713
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,600
right

714
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
so

715
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
having reviewed these critical concepts

716
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,960
and gaps we created topic areas

717
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,919
right created five topic areas in risk

718
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
governance information security

719
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,640
industrial control systems and

720
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,520
electrical engineering that we felt if

721
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
classes hit all of these topic areas

722
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,120
and their specific

723
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
concepts within these topic areas that

724
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
would be a reasonable program for

725
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,679
industrial control systems security

726
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
and we went further than that and

727
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
actually created model curriculum

728
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
so we created so we looked at what are

729
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
the classes that would need to go into

730
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,480
an associate's degree a bachelor's

731
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,960
degree a master's degree and a phd in

732
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
industrial control system security we

733
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,880
based that heavily on classes that

734
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,919
already exist we took into account

735
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,000
things like existing credit hour

736
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,880
requirements we took into account um

737
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
things like requirements for general

738
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,640
education right so we didn't ignore

739
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
the classes in language and professional

740
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
writing and so on communications

741
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
um

742
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
there is actually a report on this i

743
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
don't think it is currently posted but

744
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
it will be within the next few weeks if

745
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,880
you want to if you want to see how these

746
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
classes actually break down

747
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,720
um it will be posted as a serious

748
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
technical report if anybody is

749
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,000
interested

750
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,120
right

751
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
a couple of additional things that i

752
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,799
want to note when building programs in

753
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,880
industrial control systems security i

754
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
think it's really important to take

755
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
advantage as much as possible

756
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,960
of the potential for online offerings

757
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
right now icss because by its very

758
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
nature requires a lot of hands-on work

759
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,159
it's going to require a lot of lab work

760
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,640
but not exclusively so there are things

761
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
that students can learn at a distance

762
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
and i think having that option would be

763
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,559
beneficial to them

764
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
and also

765
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,640
much more than many other fields this is

766
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,039
an area of cyber security that really

767
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,760
needs work integrated learning right so

768
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,559
um any institution trying to create this

769
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,960
kind of program is going to have to

770
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,799
partner with some sort of industry or

771
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,159
military or other critical

772
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,080
infrastructure so that their students

773
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
can get some hands-on learning depends

774
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
on training

775
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,559
in these things not just labs but also

776
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
hand

777
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
work

778
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,279
professional work environment training

779
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,240
and

780
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,480
so the program any program would have to

781
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
think about how to

782
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,279
integrate that

783
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,679
professional work into

784
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
their assessment of the curriculum okay

785
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,679
so that's a very um sort of high

786
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,279
overview

787
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,360
of what i think is the educational

788
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
challenge

789
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
in industrial control system security

790
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,799
so are there questions

791
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,000
professor nagenbecky thank you very much

792
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,720
for your presentation uh we are right on

793
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,919
time to go to our next segment uh eda's

794
