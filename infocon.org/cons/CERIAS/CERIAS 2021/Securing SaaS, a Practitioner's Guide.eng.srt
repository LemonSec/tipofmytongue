16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
uh over to you aaron

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
thank you thanks for having me

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
let me just share my slides here

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,840
and hopefully you'll be able to see this

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
when i go in presenter mode

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
okay so today we're going to talk about

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
software as a service and i called this

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
a practitioner's guide

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,680
because i really want to talk about how

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,079
us as security professionals need to

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
protect these environments

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
when you look at big institutions you

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
know fortune 500 companies

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
universities and government institutions

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
they're they're using so much

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,439
sas so much software as a service now

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
that it's becoming our responsibility to

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
ensure that we're protecting the users

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
the data you know and how we integrate

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,880
with those systems

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
so that's we're going to focus on today

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
but before we jump into sas i want to do

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
a quick

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
refresher on the public cloud when we

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
talk about the public cloud we usually

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,720
talk about really three categories

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
infrastructure as a service platform as

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
a service and then of course our topic

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,759
software as a service

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
and infrastructure as a service is is

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
really where we have

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
basically virtual machines virtual

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
infrastructure we can spin up hard

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
drives we can spin up actual servers

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
we have complete control over everything

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,439
that's spun up there we've complete

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
control over all the compute that's

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,680
that's in that environment um of course

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
folks know the big three in that space

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
amazon web services google cloud and

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
microsoft azure there's others but those

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
are the three big ones moving on the

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
platform as a service this is where we

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
start to abstract away

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
a lot of that infrastructure you know

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,120
with with infrastructure as a service i

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
have to worry about the operating system

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
i have to worry about patching patching

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
it i have to worry about uh how much

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
hard drive and space i have and things

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
like that with platform as a service

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
the provider worries about that and all

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,879
they're really doing is they're giving

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
me an environment where i can deploy

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
code right so if i have a runtime maybe

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
it's not net or maybe it's java they

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
give me all the libraries they give me

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
all the framework that i need to be able

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
to deploy my my application and run it

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
in that environment i don't actually

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,280
have to worry about the actual operating

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
system there

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,480
and so some examples of that are things

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
like heroku elastic bean stock and aws

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
and google's app engine

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,360
and then of course our topic is moving

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
to software as a service where

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
none of that is my concern anymore i

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
don't have to worry about writing any

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,360
code i don't have to worry about

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
patching my code or vulnerabilities to

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,319
my code

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
all the code is provided by the vendor

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,599
so they they run the application and now

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
i have to have my users log in and use

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
it and

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
you know transfer data to that

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
environment

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,400
um so so really those are the the three

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
main categories we talk about when we

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
talk about public cloud and so

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
when we talk about software as a service

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
we really want to think about the

99
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
different types of categories there

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
because i think folks probably think

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
about

102
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,319
g suite and office 365 and think yeah

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
that those are typical sas applications

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,239
but there's so many more and the logos

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
there in the middle that i have on the

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
slide that's just a very very small

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
slice just to give you a sense of the

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
different types

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
of

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
sas applications that are out there

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
so we talked about productivity

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
obviously with with g suite and office

113
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
365 but there's customer resource

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
management you know things like zendesk

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
um there's collaboration suites i'm sure

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
folks have used slack um or

117
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,190
even something like um

118
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,560
[Music]

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
now discord right that's that's

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
considered software as a service too we

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
can manage documents in the cloud we can

122
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,918
do uh

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
cms content management project

124
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
management we can visualize our data so

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,440
we can do tons of analytics and and

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,560
graphics work on on on data we can also

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
deploy code and uh store our code in the

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
cloud

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
and what i find is interesting is is

130
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
that we're we're also able to even do

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
really resource intensive things things

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
that you traditionally would have

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
thought that you could only do on a on a

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
high-end workstation things like

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
rendering and editing video

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
you could basically take the entire

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
workflow of a of a tv production or a

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
film production and you could do almost

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
all of it in the cloud today there are

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
various applications that allow you to

141
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
do that

142
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
so think about even editing the video or

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
you get to a point where you want to

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,199
share it

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,680
so for instance in hollywood you know

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
folks share a pre-release movie or tv

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,800
show they call it a screener in the old

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
days they used to send dvds out uh

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
physical copies they don't do that

150
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
anymore now it's all online and we're

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,960
not talking just youtube right we're

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
talking actual secure platforms where

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
they can share these for for just folks

154
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
to see it before it gets released

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
um so the point i'm trying to make here

156
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
is really that

157
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
our businesses all all the fortune 500

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
companies governments universities we

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
are becoming so reliant on software as a

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
service you know our users are putting

161
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
critical data in this environment and

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
our business

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
just really has to run on it

164
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,919
so

165
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
uh it's becoming a concern or it's it's

166
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
been a concern for security

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,600
professionals to ensure that we protect

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
that that area

169
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,319
so

170
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
when we think about that when we think

171
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
about protecting it we probably say well

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
with all that stuff abstracted away from

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,680
us there's probably not a lot that we

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,039
need to do right it should be on the

175
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,080
vendors

176
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
and that's not true obviously we

177
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
wouldn't be having this talk if that

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
were true

179
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,680
but when we think about that we think

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
about something that's called the shared

181
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
responsibility model

182
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
so this is pretty typical

183
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
when talking about cloud environments

184
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
folks talk about the shared

185
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
responsibility model

186
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
so if you if you were to look this up

187
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
you'll see various

188
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
implementations of this basically

189
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
different ways that people talk about

190
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
the shared responsibility model and when

191
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,240
talking about infrastructure as a

192
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
service like we said we spin up

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
everything right so it's pretty much all

194
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
on us

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
we have to worry about patching the

196
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,560
operating systems we have to worry about

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
the network communication so all that

198
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
responsibility is on us

199
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
moving on the platform as a service

200
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
again a lot of that's abstracted from us

201
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
we just worry about our code that we're

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
deploying in that environment and then

203
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
the data that's there in the users

204
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
but software as a service is where it

205
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,800
gets a little a little muddy

206
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
and you'll see various versions of this

207
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,440
where some folks combine user access and

208
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
data

209
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
other folks say that well the data is

210
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
really the responsibility of the the sas

211
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,599
vendor

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
i don't think that's really true i think

213
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
that we absolutely play a part in

214
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
protecting the data because of course

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
the vendors are going to protect their

216
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,759
systems and ensure that folks can't get

217
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
to their part of it but as you'll see

218
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
through these slides there's a lot of

219
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
ways that we can enable data to be

220
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
accessed by you know undesirable people

221
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,599
undesirable locations

222
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,639
so we're going to talk a lot about that

223
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
i also think that there's something

224
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,919
that's that's actually missing from the

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
shared responsibility model we talk a

226
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
lot about user access and that's

227
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
important we talk a lot about data

228
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,840
access but what we don't talk about is

229
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
configuration

230
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
and these sas platforms you know i

231
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,520
talked about the video production ones

232
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
but even the productivity ones like g

233
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
suite and office 365

234
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
they're getting so complex now there's

235
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
so many features that are available and

236
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
some of those features can actually

237
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
reduce our security posture based on the

238
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
way that they're configured

239
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
there are even things like apis that are

240
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
available now so we can programmatically

241
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
access data programmatically access add

242
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,919
users remove users from the platform

243
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
we can integrate

244
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,400
sas

245
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,319
you know between different vendors right

246
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,039
so

247
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
something like uh maybe salesforce can

248
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
talk to slack or you know someone can

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
post something in slack and have it

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,958
automatically generate something

251
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
generate a file or a ticket in

252
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
salesforce or servicenow

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
and a lot of these platforms now are

254
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,399
getting so big that they're even

255
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
building their own app stores

256
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
so you can go into something like office

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
365 and microsoft has an app store where

258
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
you can integrate a plug-in you can get

259
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
a plug-in or an add-on from another

260
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
vendor not microsoft who's written

261
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
something that can make your team more

262
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,839
productive

263
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
but also can can increase the risk and

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
we'll talk about why that is

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
and then there's things that we can

266
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,880
configure

267
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,600
like anonymous data access

268
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
so i can turn on anonymous access in

269
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
some of these systems so that anyone

270
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
with the link can get to my data even

271
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
though my data is very sensitive and so

272
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,399
maybe a user who's not as knowledgeable

273
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
about security might might inadvertently

274
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,320
turn that on and then we've got a

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
problem with data leakage

276
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,440
so that's my case for for adding

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
configuration to the shared

278
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
responsibility model and

279
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
we're basically going to touch on all of

280
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
these

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
so

282
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
when we talk about this now when we talk

283
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,200
about user access when we talk about

284
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
data and configuration

285
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
what is our role as security

286
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
professionals in in those three areas

287
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
uh because we're not the only ones that

288
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
they have to deal with the platform

289
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
in fact we're not going to be the ones

290
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
that are actually going to configure the

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
platform most likely in a large

292
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
enterprise

293
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
you know usually there's a maybe like a

294
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
workplace technology team or a

295
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
collaboration team or

296
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
an enterprise application team that

297
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
actually maintains the sas environment

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,160
you know they're the ones that set up

299
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
the configuration they work with maybe a

300
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,600
finance or procurement department

301
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,399
to go and procure licenses they roll the

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
users onto it they onboard them do

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
training that sort of stuff

304
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,200
so where where we fall in is really

305
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
thinking about the threats to the

306
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,079
environment

307
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
and so what i've laid out here is some

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
of those steps that we really need to

309
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
focus on as security practitioners

310
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
with the first one i think being

311
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,440
modeling modeling the threats right and

312
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
so we're going to walk through threat

313
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
modeling here specific to sas

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
environments

315
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
once we've modeled that threats we need

316
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
to analyze what we can do about that so

317
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
that we can generate

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,720
a list of mitigations to reduce the risk

319
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
to the environment

320
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
right so model analyze and mitigate

321
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,240
are really critical and that's what

322
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
we're going to talk about in the bulk of

323
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
this presentation

324
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
but as i mentioned we're not the ones

325
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
deploying this right so

326
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
you know in large organizations we're

327
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,360
going to come up with those list of

328
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
mitigations but we're still going to

329
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
have to partner with our peers in i.t

330
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,880
who are actually going to be the ones

331
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
that are going to configure the

332
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,279
environment and implement those

333
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,240
mitigations for us

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,839
we also need to work closely with the

335
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,880
users

336
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,680
so you know in my example of

337
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,160
of office 365 you know some users may

338
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
say oh we're just uploading spreadsheets

339
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
and that's kind of it it's no big deal

340
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
and we may find out that actually other

341
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
users are actually uploading very

342
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
sensitive maybe personally identifiable

343
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
information maybe credit card data or

344
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
social security numbers and now we know

345
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
that there's more sensitive data in that

346
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
environment um sometimes we even see

347
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
users who will go out and get a free

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
version of a sas platform like you know

349
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,959
something like slack right where there's

350
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,320
a free tier

351
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
and when we find out about it and it

352
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
comes under our security view and we

353
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
start implementing those controls

354
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
suddenly those features that they were

355
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
using are either disabled or the the

356
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
user experience changes and now you have

357
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
a bunch of upset users

358
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,839
so an example of that would be you know

359
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,120
maybe somebody gets the free tier of

360
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
slack and then we realize we want to

361
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
deploy it across the whole company and

362
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
now they're they're using like the

363
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
enterprise grid version of slack and

364
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
we've enabled multi-factor

365
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
authentication so where they were

366
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
logging in every day which is username

367
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
and password suddenly they're being

368
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
prompted to to set up multi-factor and

369
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
have a pin on their phone and you know

370
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,639
that kind of throws them off

371
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
so we'll talk a bit about that and

372
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
how we need to be mindful of that

373
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,279
the last two parts here we won't touch

374
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
on as much we'll touch on it just a

375
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,480
little bit because it's very important

376
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
that we do monitor

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
any system any environment right as

378
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
security professionals and then we're

379
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
able to respond to incidents

380
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,399
um i think the incident response

381
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
playbook and how we monitor systems

382
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
changes just a little bit for sas so

383
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
we'll touch on that but overall it's

384
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
pretty much the same uh for any system

385
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
really so we won't delve into that too

386
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
much

387
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
so let's dive into the first part

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,360
modeling the threat

389
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,079
so

390
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,920
hopefully folks are familiar with threat

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
modeling we could absolutely spend a

392
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
whole other lecture a whole other

393
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
session talking just about threat

394
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,079
modeling so i'm going to start with a

395
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
refresher and then we're actually going

396
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,600
to do a threat model so if if you

397
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
haven't done a threat model before

398
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
hopefully you'll you'll pick it up along

399
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
the way

400
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
so what i'm showing here is just a very

401
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
high level example

402
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
of a visualization of a threat model

403
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
so here what we've done is we've laid

404
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
out the the actors we've laid out the

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,959
data flows the system components

406
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,440
you can see the trust boundaries there

407
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
and what's important to note

408
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,160
is that we're showing the the data flow

409
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,079
right we're showing the ports and

410
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,839
protocols that are being used we're

411
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
showing the type of data that might be

412
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
flowing between those systems that's

413
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,480
going to be

414
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
important context that we're going to

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,199
need

416
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,720
but the threat model really should be

417
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
looking at the system holistically right

418
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
we want to identify the gaps that are

419
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
going to reduce our security posture

420
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,920
it's going to take in multiple

421
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,240
perspectives we're going to take in

422
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,360
these

423
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
these data flows the architecture

424
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
diagrams we're going to talk to our

425
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
business stakeholders to find out how

426
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,880
they plan to use the sas service

427
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
we're going to decompose it here like we

428
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
did graphically

429
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,519
and then finally we're going to come out

430
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
with that output that list of risks and

431
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,040
mitigations which is really the whole

432
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,199
point right to come out with how we can

433
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,040
reduce risk what are the actual things

434
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
that we can implement the practical

435
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,439
actionable things

436
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
as part of threat modeling i

437
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,839
highly recommend using a framework uh

438
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,199
it's probably one of the only things

439
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,279
i'll plug in this talk and that's the

440
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199
miter attack framework

441
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
um if you're not familiar with miter i'm

442
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
not going to dive into it too much but i

443
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
am using it in my threat model so i

444
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
think you'll get a sense for how useful

445
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
it is

446
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,160
but the miter attack framework is just

447
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,880
just fantastic for this sort of thing

448
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,120
[Music]

449
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
so okay to do an actual threat model

450
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
here we need an example

451
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,320
so

452
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
i didn't want to take an actual vendor's

453
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,959
product and model that i don't want uh

454
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
microsoft or google to hound me and you

455
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,959
know uh say i was pointing out some

456
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,079
things that aren't true about their

457
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
platform so i i made up

458
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,959
a fictional productivity tweetable model

459
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
but all of these capabilities are our

460
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
real world and all these uh business use

461
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
cases are real world like we see these

462
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,880
things all the time right

463
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
so in my fictional productivity suite it

464
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,320
has a word processor spreadsheets it has

465
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
a chat application and it's document

466
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,959
storage okay easy enough we find out

467
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,000
from talking to our business

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
stakeholders that

469
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,040
they're going to send stored very

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
sensitive company documents in there

471
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
maybe it's contracts legal documents

472
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
maybe it's hr data whatever it is we

473
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,639
know it's very sensitive data so we need

474
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,079
to worry about it

475
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
you also find out

476
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
it's not going to be just employees

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
using the sas service and we see this a

478
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,800
lot too right third parties contractors

479
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
consultants they may need access to the

480
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,560
data so they're going to need accounts

481
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
into the sas environment too

482
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,920
using my earlier example of an app store

483
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
this productivity suite also has an app

484
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,519
store where users can go in and add

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,720
plugins

486
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,079
and we find out that that's on by

487
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,360
default

488
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
that's something that's just there that

489
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
users can do

490
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
we also find out that it has an api so

491
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
we can programmatically access

492
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
we find out that one of our business

493
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
units

494
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
actually wants to integrate this sas

495
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
environment

496
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
back to our on-prem corporate network

497
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
where we have an hr system

498
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
and so as you can imagine hr systems on

499
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
the corporate network highly protected

500
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,079
they're going to very sensitive data you

501
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,399
know maybe it's payroll data it's uh

502
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
information my personal information my

503
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,199
social security number that sort of

504
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,800
thing and they want to integrate with

505
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,519
that

506
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
back to uh from the from the cloud back

507
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
to on-prem

508
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
uh and then finally we know that another

509
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
business unit

510
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
wants to take a different sas product

511
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,839
and integrate it with our productivity

512
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
suite and so my example there if you're

513
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
familiar with the term ci cd continuous

514
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,160
integration continuous deployment

515
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
i mentioned earlier that

516
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,919
devops teams can deploy code in the

517
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,439
cloud right and maintain code in the

518
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,480
cloud so

519
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
you know maybe there's a a system

520
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,119
running in the cloud that can produce

521
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,799
build notifications you know build

522
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
failed or a unit test failed and so this

523
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
business unit is saying we want those

524
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
notifications to go to the chat

525
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
application as part of the sas

526
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
productivity suite

527
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,559
so another integration there that we

528
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,320
need to worry about

529
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
so

530
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
great we know what the sas

531
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,799
service is capable of we know what our

532
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,160
business users

533
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
um want to do with it and now basically

534
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
it's time to start putting our visual

535
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
threat model together and that takes

536
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
time right there's there's a lot of a

537
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,679
lot of work and a lot of thought to go

538
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,840
in there i'm gonna jump ahead in the

539
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,679
interest of time and just show the

540
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,200
threat model that i put together for

541
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,320
this

542
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
um so here hopefully you're seeing those

543
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
use cases that we laid out right we have

544
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
our corporate user connecting to the sas

545
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,799
platform

546
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,360
another sas platform can talk to that

547
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
we've got our third-party users coming

548
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
in and then we've got that connectivity

549
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
back to the hr system

550
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
but since we looked at data flows we

551
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
looked at architecture diagrams we've

552
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
learned a lot

553
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
we learned that the corporate users are

554
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
able to connect to the sas platform

555
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
using our enterprise idp or in our

556
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,760
enterprise identity platform and that's

557
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,360
something that you know as cyber

558
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,960
security team we probably maintain

559
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,039
enough control over so that's good

560
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
um the

561
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
the other thing is that we can enable

562
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
multi-factor authentication there all

563
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
good stuff

564
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
but we quickly find out that the third

565
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,679
parties they're not using our enterprise

566
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
system the sas provider just allows them

567
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
to come in with just a username and

568
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
password single factor so already we're

569
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,160
seeing an issue there

570
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
we also find out that the apis that the

571
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
sas provider has opened up for for

572
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,799
anyone to programmatically access the

573
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,760
system

574
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
can allow basic authentication that's a

575
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
legacy a legacy protocol insecure we

576
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
don't want to see that so that's also

577
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,640
not good news

578
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,160
and then finally

579
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
uh in my made-up example here we find

580
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
that the connectivity back to that

581
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
on-prem hr system

582
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,919
it's not end-to-end tls right so it's

583
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
not encrypted all the way through from

584
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
one system to the other because there's

585
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,080
a firewall in the middle uh so sometimes

586
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
you'll see things like that where where

587
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,559
the

588
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,880
tls

589
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
encryption can be terminated at the

590
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
firewall and yes you're inside the

591
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,280
corporate network at that point but the

592
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
traffic is still encrypted so we'll talk

593
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,360
about why that's bad

594
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
so immediately right just from doing the

595
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,919
visual threat model we've already found

596
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,120
some issues that we're going to have to

597
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,400
address

598
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
great so we've got our use cases we've

599
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
got our visual threat model what's next

600
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
next is going to our framework so we're

601
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,320
going to jump into the miter attack

602
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,919
framework

603
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,240
and if you're not familiar with it

604
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
the miter attack framework is a open

605
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,679
source

606
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
knowledge base of huge knowledge base of

607
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,679
adversary tactics and techniques

608
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,520
these are based on real world

609
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,159
observations right so we know that

610
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
adversaries are using these tactics and

611
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
techniques to try and compromise our

612
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
environments right whether it's

613
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,400
governments fortune 500 companies

614
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
really anywhere we see these tactics and

615
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,159
techniques

616
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,919
what i've taken here

617
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
is one of the matrices that that mitre

618
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
has created for for a different category

619
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,240
so they have a huge library but they

620
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
have these matrices for specific

621
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
categories so they have one for for sas

622
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
for software as a service so that's what

623
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
you're seeing here so they've already

624
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
done a lot of great work for us

625
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,120
um and what you can also see is the

626
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
steps the attack chain if you're

627
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
unfamiliar with that is basically the

628
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
steps that an adversary has to take to

629
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,159
act on their objectives right so whether

630
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
their objective is to get ransomware on

631
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
a system and encrypt all of our data

632
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
right and hold it for ransom

633
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
or just exfiltrate data and steal data

634
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
these are the the steps that they have

635
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,159
to take

636
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,640
um now in my example

637
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
the threat model that we're doing here

638
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
that the sas environment that i've that

639
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
i've created

640
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
it's a little bit broader than just sas

641
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
since it has another sas platform it has

642
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
third parties and we're connecting back

643
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,559
to on-prem

644
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,520
so

645
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
in my actual threat model that i'll that

646
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
i'll show you next

647
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
um i actually went through the broader

648
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,600
miter attack framework so we used pretty

649
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,280
much all the tactics and techniques we

650
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
looked through all of those

651
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,960
but i wanted to take the the one for sas

652
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
to show it here um so anyway this is a

653
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
this is a great framework like i said

654
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,280
so

655
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
the next step now taking that framework

656
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
going through those tactics and seeing

657
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,159
which ones analyzing which ones really

658
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,240
apply to our environment really apply to

659
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
that sas vendor

660
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
so this is another thing that takes a

661
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,919
long time right so a security architect

662
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,200
will spend

663
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
maybe days maybe weeks going through

664
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,360
this depending on how big the platform

665
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,159
is so i've saved us all some time and

666
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,480
and already laid that out here

667
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
and i'm going to walk through these and

668
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,919
talk about you know why we found these

669
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,159
and why these are bad

670
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,880
specific to the sas environment right so

671
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
what i've laid out here is the

672
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,159
individual threat and we came up with

673
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,520
almost a dozen

674
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,760
the actual tactic and technique from the

675
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,440
miter attack framework

676
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,600
and then the likelihood in impact um

677
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
hopefully as everybody is aware to

678
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
determine risk it's a factor of the

679
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,559
likelihood against the impact right so

680
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,159
if something is

681
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
low likelihood and low impact it's going

682
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
to be low risk right so i tried to lay

683
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
that out here take some some guesses on

684
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,600
that based on what we're seeing

685
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
so

686
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
the first thread here really goes back

687
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
to that end-to-end tls right

688
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
we have the risk of data intercept there

689
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
what we would call man in the middle or

690
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
maybe now we'd say person in the middle

691
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
or machine in the middle

692
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,520
where basically data can be intercepted

693
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
you know someone can do packet sniffing

694
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
and and see what data is being

695
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,559
transferred

696
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,000
and since it's unencrypted it's

697
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,679
potential that you could be that machine

698
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
in the middle and actually

699
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,799
modify the data

700
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
so that's a concern

701
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,440
the next two are around account takeover

702
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
and account compromise because thinking

703
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
back to those third-party accounts that

704
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
have access to our sas environment

705
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,880
they don't have multi-factor

706
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,280
authentication and they

707
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
since they're not using our idp we also

708
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
don't have controls like an anti-fraud

709
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,480
mechanism something that can detect bots

710
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
something that can detect brute force

711
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
and like credential stuffing

712
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
um so that's a big threat

713
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,640
we had mentioned the legacy

714
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
authentication right so

715
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
uh we see legacy authentication as

716
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
something that's easily uh breakable

717
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,279
today easy to be compromised it can also

718
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
be used to bypass multi-factor

719
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,000
authentication a lot of times

720
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,480
we also found out as we were exploring

721
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
the documentation from the vendor and

722
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
the way that it works that in order to

723
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
access the api you granted a service

724
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
account

725
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,480
and unfortunately the service account is

726
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,600
over permissioned and has access to more

727
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,279
uh more of the data than you would want

728
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
it to actually have access to like maybe

729
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
if you only wanted to have access to

730
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
your marketing department's data it

731
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,039
actually can have access to hr and

732
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,760
finance and other departments too

733
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,520
again these are real world things that

734
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
we see in sas environments

735
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
you know i talked earlier about

736
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
anonymous links

737
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
so we find that that's something that

738
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,279
the users can control and set up so

739
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,120
we know that that's a threat and that

740
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
could allow adversaries to discover our

741
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
our documents on the internet uh

742
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,919
potentially re-share them and once

743
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
they're gone they're gone right

744
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,640
we also find out that

745
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
the user's ability to upload files which

746
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,080
of course they need

747
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
there's no scanning

748
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,799
so

749
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
it could be a malicious insider it could

750
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,720
be maybe somebody who didn't realize

751
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,559
that they had a file that was malicious

752
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
they upload it and now we've we've

753
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
propagated malware through the system

754
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,000
other people are downloading it and it's

755
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
spreading across our enterprise

756
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,799
environment

757
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,559
so there's no file integrity checks

758
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
malicious files can be uploaded to the

759
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,559
system

760
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
something interesting is a lot of

761
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
enterprises may say

762
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
um you know maybe even universities

763
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
would say we only need access from a

764
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
certain region you know we maybe it's

765
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,039
even just the united states so why even

766
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,360
allow access from other countries

767
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,279
um you know that maybe that shouldn't be

768
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
turned on that can reduce our risk

769
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
and because for this particular use case

770
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
we have that integration back to our

771
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
on-prem environment we're worried about

772
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,559
lateral movement because of that weak

773
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,240
authentication because of that lack of

774
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
encryption

775
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,279
if something were to be compromised now

776
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,559
the blast radius as we say is greater

777
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
right it's not just to the sas

778
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
environment but it's also to all the

779
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
things that talk to it which in my

780
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
example here was our hr system

781
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
so lateral movement is a big deal for us

782
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,960
um

783
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
we talked about the the plug-ins and the

784
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,480
add-ons of course there could be

785
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,679
software vulnerabilities in those

786
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,400
add-ons um we don't know what the vendor

787
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,480
is doing to vet those

788
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
those developers and getting their their

789
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
add-ons into that that app store um you

790
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,039
know are they scanning the code what if

791
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,360
a malicious um

792
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,039
i would say a malicious vendor but

793
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,640
someone who's not really a vendor gets

794
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
into the app store because they're

795
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
trying to propagate malware so again

796
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,559
something that we need to worry about

797
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,600
and uh

798
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
finally the over permission api itself

799
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,760
right you know is that something that we

800
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
actually want enabled on the public

801
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,039
internet

802
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,640
so

803
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
long list of threats here lots of things

804
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
to worry about you know in in this in

805
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,400
this used case what are we going to do

806
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
so the next step is really to think

807
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
about those back to those three uh three

808
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
principles from the shared

809
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,039
responsibility model right the user

810
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,080
access

811
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,039
the data access and the configuration

812
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,039
what is actually available to us to fix

813
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,320
these things

814
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,440
so that's what i'm going to talk about

815
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
next

816
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
so first we're going to start with the

817
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,120
user access controls uh what is actually

818
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
available to us in the sas platform it

819
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
is important as security professionals

820
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
that we understand that

821
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
and so what we find out is that this

822
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
particular platform has something called

823
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
conditional access where we can go in

824
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,120
and either give it a

825
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,000
range of ip addresses to say only allow

826
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
users to access from this range right so

827
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,960
it's my trusted ip ranges or only allow

828
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
users to connect from these geographic

829
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,559
regions

830
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,080
so we won't mention certain countries

831
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
but maybe there's certain countries that

832
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
we would say we never want them to

833
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,000
access from there

834
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,840
um so all that is sort of part of

835
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,360
conditional access

836
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,799
we also find out that the vendor

837
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
themselves the sas platform can enforce

838
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
multi-factor authentication and not let

839
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
someone log in unless they have an mfa

840
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,559
enabled

841
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,919
so that could help us in that third

842
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,760
party use case

843
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,480
we could of course require all users to

844
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,640
use our enterprise idp or enterprise

845
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
single sign-on

846
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
that might be a user concern which we'll

847
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
talk about later where they uh you know

848
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
having to create accounts for for third

849
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,559
parties might be a little bit of a

850
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,320
hurdle for users

851
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
um we can enable things like like

852
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,799
lifecycle management right so when users

853
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
are on board and off-boarded we want to

854
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
ensure that their their accounts are

855
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
being disabled

856
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,559
um

857
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,080
you know back to strong authentication

858
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,640
no basic auth strong password policies

859
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,039
password expiration a lot of the sas

860
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
platforms can enforce those policies for

861
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,080
us and finally you know we can turn off

862
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
guest guest access and anonymous access

863
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
if you're if you're using a sas platform

864
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,799
and it doesn't have that ability you

865
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,320
know that's that's certainly a concern

866
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,240
moving on to data controls um

867
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
you know from here we can look at what

868
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,640
can we actually do with the data once

869
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,559
it's in the sas vendor's hands once it's

870
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,960
there in what we call our tenant in the

871
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,559
sas vendors uh environment and sometimes

872
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,080
you'll you'll actually be able to

873
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
encrypt your data at rest in addition to

874
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
whatever they may be doing on their

875
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
physical devices right the vendor's

876
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,760
physical hardware where hopefully

877
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
they're encrypting it

878
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
not that really it's i don't think it's

879
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
that much of a risk that someone could

880
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
walk into the data center and pull a

881
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,240
hard drive but they do encrypt for for

882
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
that scenario

883
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
so an example here might be if you've

884
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,080
ever used something like uh protonmail

885
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
the mail client

886
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
uh you can actually go in and set up a

887
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,320
second password so that you log into

888
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,399
your account with your password and mfa

889
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,080
and then your actual emails are

890
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,320
encrypted uh so you need another

891
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
password to decrypt your emails so this

892
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,159
is a data control that some sas

893
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,039
platforms have available to us

894
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
some sas platforms will even say i'll

895
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
let you limit the file types that you

896
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,039
can actually upload here so maybe in

897
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,159
this example we only want to do pdfs

898
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,919
powerpoint word excel that kind of stuff

899
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,360
we can also configure data retention

900
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,919
policies so maybe we age out and expire

901
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,360
old data

902
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
and you know that that might help us if

903
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,039
if malware was uploaded and it was you

904
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
know 60 days ago and now it's outside of

905
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,840
the data retention policy it's gone

906
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,200
already um

907
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
another thing that's it's possible in

908
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
more of these sophisticated sas

909
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
environments is digital rights

910
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
management so even if i didn't have a

911
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,559
lot of those other things turned on and

912
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,240
someone did access my data in my

913
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,159
documents they may get it and it's going

914
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
to look like garbage when they open it

915
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,399
because it's actually encrypted and it's

916
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,320
encrypted with drm they don't have the

917
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
rights to open the document so when they

918
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,760
open it it's useless to them if they get

919
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
a license because they're an authorized

920
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
user then they would be able to view the

921
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,720
content there so drm is becoming a more

922
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
important thing in some of these

923
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
environments

924
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
and then usually you can get really

925
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,000
granular with your folder and file level

926
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,679
permissions so that's an important

927
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,679
configuration

928
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,279
and something i want to point out here

929
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,000
is that these things may seem like

930
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,880
obvious but out of the box a lot of

931
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
these sas environments are not

932
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,360
configured with these things enabled

933
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,799
as an example a very popular

934
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,519
productivity suite allows you to turn on

935
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
mail out of the box that i can access it

936
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,159
from every anywhere single factor

937
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,480
through web browser so i could basically

938
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,279
just go to the apple store log in

939
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
and uh forget to shut the window and

940
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,840
anybody can then get to my mail um so

941
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
those are things that we want to make

942
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
sure that we're looking at and are

943
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,750
enabling

944
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,159
[Music]

945
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
and then finally moving on to the sas

946
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,880
configuration itself you know what what

947
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
other features and functionality we can

948
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
turn on uh usually there are things

949
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,679
where you can turn off legacy protocols

950
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,519
so using the mail example again we can

951
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,399
turn off old things like pop and imap we

952
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,480
can turn off basic auth

953
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,480
um we can disable api access or we can

954
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,200
say only users who have been granted

955
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
access to that api only a small set of

956
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
users can actually access the api so

957
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,679
it's an explicit permission list

958
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
we could turn off plugins i know this is

959
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,640
something that office 365 has

960
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,399
some users may be frustrated by that but

961
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,919
if they try to go to the app store and

962
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,919
install a plugin it just won't work it

963
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,200
tells them they need an administrator

964
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,120
install it for them so we can get some

965
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,320
vetting

966
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,279
getting a vetting process in place there

967
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,600
some of those default allow default

968
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
turned on things we can make sure that

969
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,720
those are all turned off we can go in

970
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,919
and verify those features are enabled uh

971
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
and turn them off we can even configure

972
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,039
uh the token and session lifetimes right

973
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,519
so my my apple store example where i

974
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,360
have my mail there you know if the out

975
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
of the box default is that my session

976
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
never expires um and you probably see

977
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
something like that with gmail right you

978
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
it's always you don't have to log in

979
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
again usually

980
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
we can configure those things and make

981
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,799
it make it so that uh maybe it times out

982
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,799
in 10 hours or 24 hours maybe like a

983
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,279
typical work day

984
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,039
and finally there there's in some of

985
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,720
these newer

986
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,399
more complex sas environments they're

987
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,919
actually offering the vendors are

988
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,279
offering their own application

989
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,919
protection application management they

990
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,159
will provide logs in the system so you

991
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,679
can pull event logs you can pull

992
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,240
authentication logs

993
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
they'll even allow you to say we can do

994
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,120
maybe like a host integrity check or we

995
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,000
can check um that a certificate

996
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,320
um is actually on the device to allow

997
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,159
access to it so it's it's getting into

998
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,960
more of like a device trust mode

999
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,039
so more sophisticated and it usually

1000
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,720
costs more but those are things that are

1001
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
available too

1002
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
okay so recapping where we're at right

1003
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
now so we took all the use cases we

1004
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
figured out our threats we used our

1005
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
framework and now we have the knowledge

1006
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
of what's actually available from the

1007
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,039
sas vendor what are our configuration

1008
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
options so now what

1009
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
now we take all that and we do the

1010
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,799
analysis on our threats to figure out

1011
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,679
how can we actually make realistic

1012
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,760
mitigations realistic compensating

1013
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
controls that us or our i.t

1014
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,599
administrators can apply to the sas

1015
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,320
environment to get rid of those threats

1016
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,119
and that's where the risks come in it's

1017
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,719
it's turning those threats into risks

1018
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,560
that we we basically can roll up and so

1019
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,320
again in the interest of time jumped

1020
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
ahead and done that so that nearly dozen

1021
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,918
lists of threats have really rolled up

1022
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,280
to six

1023
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
six risks

1024
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,239
and i worded these in a way that you

1025
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,079
would communicate to maybe a

1026
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
non-technical user

1027
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,159
maybe a business user right so in

1028
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,560
thinking back to the example of slack

1029
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,520
and

1030
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,119
someone saying why am i suddenly having

1031
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
to implement or input a pin on my phone

1032
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,399
just access a chat application

1033
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,239
we can show them these risks we can say

1034
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
this is why right these are the things

1035
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,399
that we're worried about so the first

1036
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
thing is that someone can can intercept

1037
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,400
our data uh you know they can intercept

1038
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
the data and there could be data leakage

1039
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
so we know that you're uploading very

1040
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,800
sensitive data to the environment we

1041
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
have to we have to solve for that

1042
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
so how are we going to do that we're

1043
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,720
going to ensure that it's end-to-end

1044
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
encryption

1045
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,000
we're going to disable any features in

1046
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
the sas platform that allow for

1047
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,640
unencrypted traffic

1048
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
on the account compromise front we're

1049
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,240
going to implement things like

1050
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,119
privileged access management so for

1051
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,040
users who are like administrators or

1052
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,880
privileged access

1053
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
they're going to be restricted in what

1054
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
they can do or they may have to do

1055
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
something like a just-in-time admin

1056
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,040
access where they have to check out

1057
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,960
their administrative capabilities to

1058
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
access the environment

1059
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
these are real things that we can

1060
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,800
implement

1061
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,040
for that for that use case

1062
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,400
we're going to implement that user

1063
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,680
account management the lifecycle

1064
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,880
management that we talked about we're

1065
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,599
going to enforce mfa password policies

1066
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
the ip restrictions the conditional

1067
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,880
access and we may not be able to enforce

1068
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
it especially since we have everything

1069
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
else but we can recommend that those

1070
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
third-party users only use our

1071
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,880
enterprise single sign-on so they're

1072
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
using our idp which we control

1073
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,200
on the api front uh you know use and

1074
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,359
abuse of the apis as another entry

1075
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,040
vector for for data leakage or

1076
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
unauthorized access we're going to

1077
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,720
disable any legacy protocols we're going

1078
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,880
to disable the legacy authentication

1079
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,599
we're going to enforce key rotation

1080
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,040
um so you know a an actual key to access

1081
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,839
the api has to be rotated maybe every 30

1082
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,240
days or maybe every six months uh

1083
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
depending on our risk tolerance level

1084
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,480
there so if a key did get compromised

1085
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,160
you know we can rotate it out and that

1086
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,800
authentication goes away

1087
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
we're also going to reduce

1088
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
the the amount of users that can access

1089
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
the api and the functions that they can

1090
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,920
call maybe they don't need read write

1091
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,680
and delete to the api maybe they only

1092
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
need to read the data we don't want them

1093
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,440
modifying the data so we're going to

1094
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
we're going to implement that too

1095
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,359
on the system misconfiguration side

1096
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,119
right the anonymous access the guest

1097
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
access that we talked about

1098
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
we're basically going to disable those

1099
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
we're going to disable the guest

1100
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,119
anonymous and expiring urls

1101
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,880
and if there's any kind of application

1102
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
isolation or sandboxing that the sas

1103
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
provider provides which i'm going to

1104
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
talk about on the next slide

1105
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
we'll want to turn that on too along

1106
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
with uh with drm

1107
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,200
and then on the the thread of malware

1108
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
the risks of malware being uploaded to

1109
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
the system we're going to turn on file

1110
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,800
integrity checks enforce that it's

1111
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
actually checking the metadata that it's

1112
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,359
you know is it does it say it's a jpeg

1113
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,599
but it's actually executable

1114
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,720
we're going to implement some

1115
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
vulnerability scanning and scanning of

1116
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
the files themselves we can we can

1117
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
actually plug in malware scanners uh to

1118
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,079
the files and disable those plugins so

1119
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,560
that administrators have to approve it

1120
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
before an add-on is added to the

1121
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,280
environment to reduce risk

1122
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
and finally

1123
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
thinking back to the sas environment

1124
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
being able to talk back to our on-prem

1125
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,079
environment we need to think about

1126
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,160
network segmentation we need to think

1127
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
about vulnerability scanning of our

1128
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,200
environment we want to make sure that

1129
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
any any holes are plugged in our

1130
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,960
environment so that as that that data is

1131
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
traversing or that connectivity is

1132
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
happening back to our other systems that

1133
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,839
all that is either separated off or you

1134
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,960
know scanned for any other

1135
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
vulnerabilities

1136
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,280
um

1137
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,560
so hopefully the takeaway so far is that

1138
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,880
there's a lot there's a lot to do in

1139
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
that shared responsibility model right

1140
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,960
it looked small it looked like we just

1141
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,640
had user access data access and

1142
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,720
configuration to worry about but we've

1143
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,040
came up with we've come up with so many

1144
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
mitigations that actually need to be

1145
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,040
implemented in just one

1146
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,119
sas provider just one vendor that we're

1147
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,880
using

1148
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,440
but that's not it that's not all

1149
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
uh there's more

1150
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
and

1151
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
you know i touched on it earlier i

1152
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,119
mentioned monitoring and incident

1153
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,680
response it's critical right i don't

1154
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
want to

1155
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
i don't want to skip that but uh

1156
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
part of that is is seeing what the

1157
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,359
vendor actually has available to us you

1158
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
know if we're using our enterprise

1159
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,800
single sign-on if we're using our

1160
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
enterprise idp

1161
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,720
we can capture authentication logs so we

1162
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,960
can look for anomalous activity right we

1163
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,359
can look to see did aaron log in from

1164
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,760
from pennsylvania and then an hour later

1165
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
logged in from china that doesn't look

1166
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,320
right uh you know we can see what other

1167
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,800
events the vendors have and pull those

1168
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
logs in to do our monitoring and

1169
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
incident response and we should be

1170
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,880
asking the vendor themselves what do you

1171
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,359
do when you detect an incident how

1172
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,280
quickly do you notify us and how quickly

1173
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
are you going to engage us

1174
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
so it's not even just about the

1175
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,520
mitigations right it's about the

1176
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,920
proactive monitoring of the environment

1177
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,359
and having a strong incident response

1178
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,119
playbook

1179
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,480
but there is more that we can actually

1180
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
ask of the vendor too right so

1181
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,119
we can vet the vendor we can do a vendor

1182
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,960
security review we can ask for

1183
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
certifications we can ask them for pen

1184
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,200
test reports they're not always going to

1185
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
share this data with us and we're

1186
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
certainly not going to ask microsoft of

1187
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,319
that but a smaller

1188
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,000
you know i'll say like mom and pop or

1189
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,200
startup

1190
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,520
sas vendor they're probably eager to get

1191
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,160
our licenses and get it get on contract

1192
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,240
so they will share their stock to

1193
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
compliance they will share

1194
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
maybe a third party assessment that was

1195
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
done and that that helps us to

1196
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,839
understand that okay they've got a good

1197
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,680
cyber security process in place too so

1198
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,040
we know they're doing what they need to

1199
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,560
do as part of the shared responsibility

1200
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,720
model

1201
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,319
i mentioned earlier you know creating

1202
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,319
hurdles for the user right we do want to

1203
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,720
be cognizant of that

1204
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,480
if we implement too many controls or

1205
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,800
controls that uh that users can just

1206
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,720
circumvent

1207
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
you know we we haven't done our job

1208
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,920
right if they can get around our

1209
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,880
controls or they go use another platform

1210
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
uh so so my example of slack if they're

1211
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
like well now you put all these controls

1212
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,359
around slack i don't want to use it

1213
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,760
anymore i'm just going to go use discord

1214
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
we have no no visibility no control we

1215
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,359
didn't implement anything on discord so

1216
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,359
now we've made things actually worse

1217
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,800
so we got to make sure that we partner

1218
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,119
with the business and that you know sort

1219
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,560
of shifting over

1220
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,000
to a different platform we're not

1221
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,680
telling them telling us about another

1222
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,839
platform we call that shadow i.t right

1223
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,640
so we have to be aware of that

1224
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,240
but what can we do about about things

1225
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,800
like shadow it and are there tools that

1226
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,480
are out there that can help us

1227
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
aside from all the mitigations and

1228
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,079
monitoring and controls that we can do

1229
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,960
yes these tools exist i'm definitely not

1230
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,440
going to plug any tools here

1231
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,119
you know i think

1232
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,599
i my personal opinion is that our money

1233
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,359
is is better spent on on people and

1234
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,560
process

1235
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
less on tools but there are tools that

1236
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,800
can help so when talking about something

1237
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,599
like

1238
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,800
shadow i.t something called a casbi a

1239
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
cloud security access broker is

1240
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,720
something that can can potentially help

1241
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
though it may cause noise

1242
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
there's two types of casbis one is a

1243
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
forward proxy

1244
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
they actually you filter all your data

1245
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,760
back through

1246
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,640
uh

1247
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
through the casbie and he can he can

1248
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,119
monitor that traffic so we can see hey

1249
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,920
we you you sent five terabytes of data

1250
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,880
last month to dropbox but onedrive is

1251
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,319
actually your system of choice so what's

1252
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,920
going on there's a lot of shadow i.t

1253
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,319
there there's other casbies that don't

1254
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,240
filter the traffic through they actually

1255
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
query the apis of the sas environments

1256
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,200
to tell you what's going on there

1257
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,800
of course there's data loss prevention

1258
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
systems so we can we can monitor where

1259
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,079
documents are going or if they're

1260
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,800
leaving our environment

1261
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,760
there's

1262
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,520
mobile data management and mobile

1263
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
application management where we can

1264
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,480
actually

1265
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,680
manage the devices and we can say

1266
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,119
we're not going to allow you to access

1267
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,280
the sas environment unless you have this

1268
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,640
tool on there that

1269
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
monitors the device and manages the

1270
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
device and protects it and sometimes

1271
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
that can even create a secure container

1272
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
like microsoft actually has this for

1273
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
office 365 where it can keep all of your

1274
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,160
office documents in the office 365 apps

1275
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,280
on your phone so it reduces the risk of

1276
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,880
data leakage because it can't leave that

1277
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,040
secure container

1278
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,640
uh and the last tool here is something

1279
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,720
new that a lot of vendors are jumping

1280
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,079
all over now or saying that they have a

1281
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,400
solution for it's called sassy

1282
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,119
uh secure access service edge and it's

1283
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,359
it's it's flipping that model of of

1284
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,040
sending all that traffic through like a

1285
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,200
cosby or even back to your on-prem

1286
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,520
firewalls um and they're basically

1287
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
targeting the services at the connection

1288
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,640
source

1289
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,520
to do some security control there

1290
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,040
so uh

1291
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,480
really that that's everything i wanted

1292
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
to cover let's talk about the takeaways

1293
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
and then then we'll open up to q a with

1294
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,319
the time we have left

1295
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,240
but hopefully the takeaway you got here

1296
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,920
is that the shared responsibility model

1297
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,000
doesn't tell the whole story right

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,599
we went through over two dozen

1299
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,760
mitigations that we need to implement in

1300
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,680
our world and in those three categories

1301
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,760
for the show responsibility model but

1302
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
threat modeling is a really powerful

1303
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,160
tool for determining the risk to these

1304
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,400
platforms and really to any system that

1305
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,000
we have control over

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,880
um

1307
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,280
we we need to consider what options are

1308
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,800
available in those sas platforms so we

1309
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,480
need to look at the platform

1310
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
holistically and see what's available

1311
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,000
and partner with our users and with it

1312
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,359
admins

1313
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,800
and then finally

1314
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,720
tooling it's not the be all end-all it

1315
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,960
can help but really the most important

1316
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
thing from that perspective is spending

1317
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,040
time on incident response and

1318
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,680
proactive monitoring

1319
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,520
so with that

1320
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
happy to open it up to to questions i

1321

will make one more plug i plugged the

1322
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
miter attack framework i'll plug my

yeah um i mean if you want to email me i

1334
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,680
can i can mail the presentation i think

1335
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,200
my graphics are a little big so it might

1336
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,079
come in at around like 12 megs

1337
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,000
but otherwise if uh you know i could

1338
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,680
always send it to uh to the

1339
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,280
administrators here if they want to

1340
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,560
share it but i have no problem sharing

1341
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,200
the presentation

1342
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,640
looks like we have one in the chat um oh

1343
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,680
see that now yeah go ahead and uh

1344
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,880
sure how good are you finding the

1345
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,319
various providers of publishing best

1346
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,920
practices for securing their sas

1347
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,040
deployments

1348
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,119
it's all over the place to be totally

1349
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
honest you know uh if you're if you are

1350
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,079
deploying something like like office 365

1351
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,079
tons of documentation maybe a little

1352
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,200
overwhelming

1353
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
uh they do a really great job with that

1354
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
and some of the bigger vendors for sure

1355
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,760
uh smaller companies it's it's hard to

1356
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,800
even get

1357
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,880
their best practices for for what

1358
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,720
they're doing to protect the environment

1359
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
let alone uh how you should be

1360
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,480
implementing security so it is kind of

1361
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,240
all over the map currently i'd say

1362
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,520
i see a hand raised too i think uh yeah

1363
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,280
looks like giovanni um

1364
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,599
giovanni i turned on your microphone if

1365
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,240
you would like to speak

1366
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,359
i see another question where we're

1367
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,640
waiting what actions does a platform

1368
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,400
take when in the midst of a

1369
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,680
in the midst of or after a cyber attack

1370
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,480
so if we're if we're asking about the

1371
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,880
the vendor themselves

1372
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,680
typically we want the vendor to tell us

1373
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,400
as

1374
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,480
quickly as possible

1375
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,800
when we have a strong incident response

1376
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
team and we have a strong playbook

1377
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,079
we want to get in in the loop

1378
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,280
immediately right we want to do the

1379
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,880
investigations on our side too so we

1380
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,200
want them to pull us in but oftentimes

1381
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,720
they're going to do their triage first

1382
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
because they're worried about upsetting

1383
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
the uh the customers right so they're

1384
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
going to say is this real they're going

1385
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
to do some active investigations and

1386
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,800
then sometimes notify us maybe a little

1387
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,720
bit too late of the breach

1388
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,280
so that varies a lot too but um but yeah

1389
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
we want them to to uh to notify us as

1390
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,760
soon as possible

1391
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,920
i see another question in there how does

1392
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,359
having multiple levels of security

1393
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,480
within an organization complicate models

1394
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,599
uh

1395
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,920
that's a great question it it definitely

1396
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
complicates things so

1397
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,079
if you have a very large organization

1398
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
that has separate business units and

1399
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,640
maybe they have their own security teams

1400
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
how do you get that enterprise

1401
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,559
perspective what if one business unit is

1402
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,559
using slack for this purpose and another

1403
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,400
one's using discord and another one's

1404
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
using microsoft teams you know how do we

1405
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,960
apply the same

1406
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,520
logic to all of them it's difficult it's

1407
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,280
extremely difficult i think in

1408
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,119
organizations where

1409
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,480
you have a

1410
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,520
a overarching cyber security team that

1411
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,400
covers all the business units that makes

1412
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
it better now you still need folks

1413
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
embedded in the business to understand

1414
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,839
their use cases and work directly with

1415
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,599
them but it's better to have that

1416
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,760
overarching enterprise view i think but

1417
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,599
yeah multiple levels multiple different

1418
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
teams and security can complicate things

1419
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,559
another how do you handle employees

1420
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,800
using tools such as box et cetera how do

1421
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,319
you track where your data is going it's

1422
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,440
a problem

1423
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,920
it's definitely a problem um i think

1424
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,880
that the tools help a bit there today in

1425
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,680
the

1426
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,440
like things like dlp

1427
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,319
if we if we can use dlp to say hey this

1428
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,280
is going to box or dropbox but microsoft

1429
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,880
onedrive is our actual solution of

1430
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,000
choice

1431
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,839
the best that that can do really is

1432
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,760
probably alert us

1433
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,079
sometimes it can block stuff but a lot

1434
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,760
of times that becomes noise and so you

1435
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,000
know typically enterprises will have it

1436
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,520
just in alert mode

1437
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,440
and then you know you'll see someone

1438
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,280
mailing something or putting something

1439
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,359
in box and they say it actually wasn't

1440
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,119
company data i was using my company

1441
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,400
computer

1442
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,200
to do my home finance spreadsheet

1443
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,599
so that becomes really difficult where i

1444
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,599
think the future is going

1445
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,599
is digital rights management or

1446
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,119
information rights management because

1447
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,119
then it almost doesn't matter let them

1448
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
put it in box let them put it in dropbox

1449
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
let them put it in one drive

1450
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,119
if if no one can actually do anything

1451
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,559
with the data because they're not

1452
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,240
authenticated they're not authorized to

1453
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,280
see it that helps us tremendously

1454
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,440
so i don't think it's as mature as we

1455
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,640
want it to be yet i think there's

1456
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,240
there's a lot of strong capabilities

1457
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,880
there for pdfs words word and office

1458
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,200
documents but maybe not so much for

1459
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,359
video and in other different data types

1460
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,640
uh see another one in the chat here um

1461
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,079
any lines in the sand where you simply

1462
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,160
won't do business with the sas provider

1463
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,960
despite push from from the business unit

1464
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,079
we try we absolutely try i would say

1465
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,240
that most security professionals will

1466
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,440
say

1467
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,440
i have to lay out the risks right and

1468
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,000
and that's my job is to say this is how

1469
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,920
serious this is this is how big of an

1470
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,640
impact it's going to be right like

1471
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,480
this risk might be so serious that we're

1472
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,920
going to be in the news we're going to

1473
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,400
impact customer data and then the best

1474
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,680
that we can do

1475
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,400
really is is escalate that to the

1476
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,559
highest levels that we can but sometimes

1477
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,319
at some point there might be an

1478
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,000
executive at a really high level that's

1479
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,040
going to say

1480
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,520
i'm willing to accept that risk

1481
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,359
i'm letting cyber security or the

1482
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,960
security team go and it's not your

1483
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,640
responsibility i'm just going to accept

1484
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
that risk we hate when that happens

1485
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,319
because we feel like we didn't fix

1486
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,440
anything

1487
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,359
so we try to draw the line in the sand

1488
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,359
but it's not always possible

1489
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,119
okay

1490
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,119
anymore

1491
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,760
definitely happy to answer more

1492
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
questions through email if folks think

1493
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,559
of any later um so

1494
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,559
yeah great um

1495
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,839
i think that was good that was great

1496
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,839
talk um thank you thanks a lot

1497
