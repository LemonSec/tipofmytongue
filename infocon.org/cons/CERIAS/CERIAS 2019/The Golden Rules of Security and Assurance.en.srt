1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:08,130
okay hi everyone today we have Steve

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,989
Loudoun from Sally Mae he's the senior

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,269
director of cyber security operations

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,370
and corporate security and so he focuses

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,200
on managing perimeter security endpoint

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,990
protection application security

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,660
vulnerability management and threat

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,788
intelligence so he's published in lots

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,550
of security conferences he spoke at many

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,109
different venues he's got his master's

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,289
in computer science from here at Purdue

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,500
where he was part of the serious program

13
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:37,340
so welcome Steve and I'll let you take

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,340
it away Thanks

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:46,468
so I am a computer science master's

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,350
probably before many of you were born so

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,960
it's been awhile I wanted to do two

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,840
things kind of give you an understanding

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,420
of the cloud and what we just did as a

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,579
company moving into the cloud before I

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,160
do that what do you guys think the cloud

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,450
is what's the cloud to you guys when you

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,970
hear the cloud is it datacenters ok good

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,460
and the other major piece is besides

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,789
someone else's computer applications out

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,009
there right so big applications you guys

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,650
were in Facebook there in the cloud

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,900
Netflix they own like half of Amazon's

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,450
infrastructure I think to do what you

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,540
guys do eight hours a day watch Netflix

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,670
right so the cloud is either a big

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,950
application running or it's the

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,080
infrastructure that you form you

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:44,190
formulate for your data center ass

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:48,679
aspects we are a bank so we're a little

36
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:51,360
bit more focused on where our assets are

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,240
because a we don't want to lose your

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,210
money and B we don't want to lose data

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,970
about you that the hackers are all

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,009
trying to get who's who's heard of a

41
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,280
breach in the last five days there's

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,640
always one popping up right anthem who

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,470
is headquartered in Indianapolis they

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,760
lost like 79 million records of people

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,000
that have insurance through them

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,790
79 million they just a couple months ago

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,939
actually put out arrest warrants for two

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,590
individuals from China that did that so

49
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,120
it's happening all the time my job is to

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,230
make sure that I protect the bubble

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,900
around the data so that you don't lose

52
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,268
your your information your social

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,409
security number your account number your

54
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:47,579
credit card number if we may have that

55
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:49,500
about so from our perspective we're not

56
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,510
the first one the first bank to go all

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,310
in the cloud we're a fast follower but

58
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,170
we're finding out that being a fast

59
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,739
follower still means that you got to set

60
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,200
some some standards and some policy and

61
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:06,209
some activities that our bank regulators

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,220
weren't really readily aware of a little

63
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,690
bit about Sallie Mae Sallie Mae many of

64
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,819
you might have heard our name in the

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,720
past we did federal student loan

66
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:20,040
processing in 2014 we split the company

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,660
into Sallie Mae bank and an aven't

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,078
federal student loan processing so if

69
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,430
you have a student loan today you might

70
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,829
have navient

71
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,870
servicing you helping you pay for the

72
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,500
loan that's not the company I work for I

73
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,000
work for Sallie Mae we're a bank we have

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,879
retail banking on the internet so we're

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,599
an internet bank we also have you

76
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,948
promise for 529s and as of this year we

77
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,060
launched a credit card so there's three

78
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:53,669
different credit cards you can get a

79
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,609
student card a just recent grad card and

80
00:03:53,669 --> 00:04:00,530
then a lifer card with different or

81
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:02,849
rewards programs on it so we're a bank I

82
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:06,120
say that a lot because it does mean a

83
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,698
lot that we're a bank when we split the

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,669
company in 2014 beforehand we had all of

85
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:14,579
our data center assets on Prem on Prem

86
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:17,010
means in our buildings we had servers

87
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,159
and racks and network gear and all that

88
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:24,810
stuff in our in our own offices when we

89
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:27,000
split the company we went on the Sallie

90
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,410
Mae side we took the advantage of

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
splitting the company to

92
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,860
basically get all new resources a lot of

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
a lot of value there but all those new

94
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,400
resources were in a managed data center

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,710
so we no longer had a data center in our

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,409
building we didn't have people dedicated

97
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,210
to racking and stacking and wiring and

98
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,770
updating and all that stuff we paid

99
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:53,840
somebody else to do that managed data

100
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:57,270
center we spent the last six months of

101
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,299
2018 taking all of those assets in a

102
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:04,080
data center managed by somebody else and

103
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,760
putting them into the cloud so we took

104
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,830
all of our servers and moved them into

105
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,570
the cloud we're not the first back to do

106
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,919
that but I think we're like the second

107
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,650
one of the from a security perspective

108
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,620
one of the main things that we gained by

109
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:22,080
doing that when we moved from on Prem to

110
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,620
managed is we got rid of legacy

111
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,580
equipment we had no mainframes we had no

112
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,710
mid-range as/400 servers we had no old

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,719
Windows 2000 servers

114
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,599
none of that legacy from a security

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,730
perspective that reduced our threat

116
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,700
exposure and our attack surface

117
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,830
everything is now up-to-date patched and

118
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,190
not as vulnerable so that was a big win

119
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,250
for us when we moved it to the cloud we

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,780
gained even further management and

121
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:57,690
security aspects that the cloud provides

122
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:00,090
you don't hear about Amazon getting

123
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,280
hacked you hear about companies in

124
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,929
Amazon that misconfigured their their

125
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,719
setup getting hacked but not really

126
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:12,090
Amazon itself back to the bank we're not

127
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,430
a big bank we're not Citibank or Chase

128
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:19,469
or something like that we're in the top

129
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,800
100 we do have banking assets we always

130
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,750
have if you want a CD or something

131
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,220
similar to make money a money market

132
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:31,770
account we always have one of the best

133
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,900
rates so again we're a bank and we the

134
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,590
reason why I say this is because we have

135
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,229
application developers that want to be

136
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,849
fast and don't necessarily want to take

137
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,058
security into consideration and so

138
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:46,649
we have to remind them we are a bank we

139
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:51,360
don't want you to do programs that

140
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:55,580
expose data for example when we made

141
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,110
that shift the we we basically

142
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,469
refactored our applications and

143
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,800
reformulated some of our environments we

144
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:08,819
took the Upromise 529 program and they

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,499
were on basically on-prem data assets we

146
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,689
didn't even move them to the cloud we

147
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:15,209
just basically moved them all to

148
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,719
salesforce another third-party cloud

149
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:21,719
provider so salesforce now is in charge

150
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:24,179
of the servers the security the

151
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,800
encryption all that we're not

152
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:27,330
responsible for that anymore

153
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,029
we have lots of good contracts so that

154
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,568
if something happens with salesforce we

155
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:40,039
have monetary reward basis and SLA saan

156
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:45,419
that when we made the move we took

157
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:48,058
virtual machines VMware images in the

158
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,789
managed data center and basically move

159
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,619
those over to Amazon taking out some

160
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,199
stuff and adding some other new stuff in

161
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:58,529
so it was a fairly easy move for us to

162
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:05,490
take an image and put it over into into

163
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:07,259
Amazon since we've finished that we

164
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,550
that's called a lifted shift strategy

165
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,129
there's a couple of different ways that

166
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,899
you can move your stuff we did the take

167
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,929
these assets and move them over here the

168
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,909
other asset is application refactoring

169
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:20,969
so you've got an app that sits on server

170
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,969
here but let's change it up modify it

171
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,800
and move it into the cloud and oh by the

172
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:29,339
way let's not use servers anymore let's

173
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,169
use serverless infrastructure we chose

174
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,838
the fast route which was lifting shift

175
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:39,360
not the longer term application

176
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:42,209
adjustment in that process but now that

177
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,540
we've finished that we are in our

178
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:50,069
application modernization phase so we'll

179
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:52,290
take an app that has 45 micro services

180
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,689
tied to it and try and move those

181
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,219
services into serverless functions or

182
00:08:54,689 --> 00:09:00,150
containers

183
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,220
so in Amazon we'll try to do a managed

184
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,160
database service rather than Oracle or

185
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,210
Microsoft sequel will try to use lambda

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,449
functions and step functions and glue

187
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:20,550
and all these Amazon services that seem

188
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:26,180
to pop up weekly we have also in our

189
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:29,310
organization changed our model from a

190
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,469
waterfall development model in our

191
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,219
application development to an agile

192
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:39,060
model who knows what agile means you

193
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,670
guys half-and-half here so our waterfall

194
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,109
model is basically do a bunch of changes

195
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,540
behind the scenes and make a release

196
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,500
once or twice a year into production in

197
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,270
this new agile model it's make a quick

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
change and move it to production make a

199
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,189
quick change move it into production I

200
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,250
think I've heard like Netflix does a

201
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,240
thousand changes a day in their

202
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:06,540
infrastructure and they do let's only

203
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,250
have this region tested mmm let's have

204
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,520
this region test something different and

205
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,470
a B and blue-green and are some of the

206
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,660
terms that they use but we're in the

207
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,850
process of moving towards that faster

208
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,620
release model in our app modernization

209
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:24,660
so it's quick you can take a customer's

210
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,810
request for a feature hey can you add a

211
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,890
green button instead of a red button and

212
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,319
instead of wait six months or a year

213
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,510
before you roll that out pull it out

214
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,420
tomorrow

215
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,460
however security is one of those things

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,510
that as a bank we have to make sure that

217
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,630
we're not change that from a masked

218
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:48,720
social security number to just show the

219
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,820
whole thing and publish it yeah we can't

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,400
let our application developers make

221
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,350
mistakes like that so we have to be a

222
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,360
little cautious when we move into that

223
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,700
and dev SEC Ops is the term that they

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,780
use combining developers security and

225
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,060
operations all in a single agile team

226
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:08,550
from our organization we're a very

227
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,300
mature security organization if you take

228
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,019
a look at other

229
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:17,459
openes our size there we basically are

230
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:20,430
more mature than standard you can see

231
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:25,170
that we have lots of years of experience

232
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,790
in the leadership and we you can see the

233
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,010
the breakdown of how we have our

234
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,839
organization we combine physical

235
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:38,160
security and information security into

236
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:41,070
the same security organization again on

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,949
the maturity side we are again very

238
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,160
mature based on what we do our

239
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:50,880
regulators you guys probably have heard

240
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,240
this fdic-insured term if you have money

241
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,870
in a bank in the u.s. our regulators are

242
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:03,329
the FDIC they come in and assess our IT

243
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:05,850
and our security twice a year we are

244
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,890
trying to evaluate how good we're doing

245
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,740
and they have a tool called the cyber

246
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:15,209
assessment tool where they have a list

247
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:19,560
of standards that go from your the your

248
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:22,829
the local bank you have one office in

249
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,209
one branch to your Citigroup and your

250
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,660
maturity has to differ

251
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:32,010
it really does your if you're the one

252
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:35,310
bank in middle of Indiana your

253
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,569
requirements on how you drive security

254
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,560
through your processes are a lot

255
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:44,339
different than Citibank or Chase or JP

256
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Morgan those guys since they're so big

257
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,839
since they have so many resources they

258
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,579
they should be setting standards and

259
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,089
driving the security industry as a whole

260
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,520
for financial services we find that we

261
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,579
are more mature than the size of our

262
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,250
company and our regulators generally

263
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,829
like that just try to give you a good

264
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,910
idea on that so I've kind of given I

265
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:12,959
believe at this time a background on

266
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,279
security my team we basically as was

267
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,170
mentioned earlier we're trying to

268
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,670
protect the perimeter and the endpoints

269
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,680
if you guys have laptops do you have

270
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,479
antivirus on it is there a

271
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,959
forensics tool on there in case you guys

272
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,720
download malware and have the issues my

273
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,498
team manages that they do the incident

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,999
response in case there's a malware that

275
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:37,860
gets through our other protection

276
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:41,040
mechanisms we have a what's called a

277
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,139
very large security stack that's taking

278
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,019
all these appliances and solutions and

279
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,399
putting them in a stack in the on-prem

280
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,759
data center you used to have a rack that

281
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,899
was just for security don't have that in

282
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,369
the cloud but we still have the same

283
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:59,699
security solutions and my team manages a

284
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:02,699
lot of those we we think we're doing

285
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:05,490
pretty well but everybody has different

286
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:09,479
measures and how you figure out whether

287
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:14,249
you're doing well or not so we have not

288
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,300
as far as we know lost any data that's a

289
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:19,439
good thing right the other way that

290
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,929
attackers are hitting people is they'll

291
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:25,829
send in a email like they're the CEO to

292
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:27,929
the CFO and say hey I'm busy can you

293
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:31,439
please transfer money to this account

294
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:34,589
here we actively blocked that we've

295
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:36,899
never had any wire transfer being sent

296
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,480
out that shouldn't have happened we

297
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:43,769
haven't had ransomware hit us you guys

298
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:48,480
hear that quite frequently 23 cities and

299
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:50,579
Texas got hit with ransomware we don't

300
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,970
believe that we've had any of our inside

301
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:56,429
employee accounts compromised the other

302
00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:01,170
thing is that you see in a company is

303
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:04,290
yeah that guy had he clicked a link and

304
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,748
it downloaded bad software and antivirus

305
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,389
didn't fix it so we've got to take his

306
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:13,350
system and basically blow it away and

307
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:16,920
reload the operating system we only do

308
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:20,579
that on 2,000 employees we only do that

309
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,649
once every other month so all of those

310
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,420
security tools that I talked about in

311
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,119
the stack they're doing a good enough

312
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,849
job in preventing bad stuff from getting

313
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:32,730
to the end point that we have to blow it

314
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,690
away and reload it so we think we're

315
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:40,160
doing a pretty good job that's Sally May

316
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,590
security what questions you guys have

317
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,589
I'm really interested in questions go

318
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,660
okay how hard of a challenge was it to

319
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,610
convince the company to move into the

320
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,800
cloud was it difficult excellent

321
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:07,470
questions so we spent approximately two

322
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,469
years working with our regulators the

323
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,680
FDIC to talk to them about the cloud

324
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:17,550
they the traditional banking environment

325
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,920
is still mainframes it's still on Prem

326
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,229
data centers where they can walk in they

327
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,819
can see the physical security of your

328
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,530
data center they can see that your

329
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,750
lights are blinking that you're doing

330
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:31,350
the right things so it took us about two

331
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,410
years to discuss with the with our

332
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,010
regulators FDIC and do a lot of tipping

333
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:42,360
our toes in the water to test it out it

334
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,100
it was not easy and I I don't know if

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,210
you guys saw this in the news in the

336
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:52,380
last two three weeks but Capital One

337
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:55,290
lost 106 million records Capital One is

338
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,850
one of the first ones to go largely into

339
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,810
the cloud they're not 100% but they're

340
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,190
largely in the cloud and they go to

341
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,490
conferences and talk all the time about

342
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:09,630
how good a job they're doing so if they

343
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,880
can get hacked and lose data I'm sure

344
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,740
the next time our regulators come in in

345
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,959
two months you're gonna ask a lot of

346
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,459
questions how can you not have Capital

347
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,069
One happen to you so it's a challenge on

348
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,610
our side good great question any other

349
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,959
questions about Sallie Mae yeah yeah so

350
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,639
you could give like an estimate how

351
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,970
often are you under attack and can you

352
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,230
say another word besides constantly no I

353
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,770
can't say that another word besides

354
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,800
concert but let me tell you one of the

355
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,470
again one of the benefits of moving from

356
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,740
an on-prem managed data center into the

357
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,710
cloud is our visibility as a security

358
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,310
team went way up we got a lot more logs

359
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,120
we got

360
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:57,629
more visibility on our infrastructure we

361
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,689
went from a billion events a day in our

362
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,180
sim security information event

363
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,340
management tool to over two billion

364
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,200
events a day just by moving our stuff

365
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,250
into the cloud so our visibility went

366
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,830
way up and of course we're seeing just

367
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,840
today we had other conversations with

368
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,120
other banks that this address and Iran

369
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,000
is hitting us you know so we see it all

370
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,770
the time we share information with other

371
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,420
banks quite actively to tell when

372
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,310
there's a lot of probing or a lot of

373
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,660
account takeover type activity that's

374
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:36,440
happening but definitely we've seen a

375
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:42,690
lot more got a lot more visibility there

376
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:44,880
good question as we were taking our move

377
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,440
into the cloud we set up what we called

378
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,120
some golden rules here are the things

379
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,310
that we want to make sure that we do as

380
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,320
we move to the cloud some of these word

381
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:57,179
discussions specifically with our

382
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,149
regulators I I didn't make up the titles

383
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,580
that were there I used those from

384
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,960
another organization but the the bullet

385
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,320
items are what we did

386
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,750
so make systems harder to attack and

387
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,419
harder to penetrate what we did is

388
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,200
implement a couple of technologies one

389
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:20,700
called software-defined perimeter it's

390
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,370
it's pretty new it originated out of the

391
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,370
Defense Network so if you're in the

392
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,379
military you've got four or five

393
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,270
different nations working together in a

394
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,550
particular campaign how do you share

395
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,460
information and yet keep them out of

396
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,540
your dark black networks

397
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,820
software-defined perimeter is one of the

398
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,080
solutions that came out of that

399
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,520
coca-cola was one of the first companies

400
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:48,360
to actually use it to protect their coke

401
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,470
formula yep to get into a coke formula

402
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,689
you have to go through a

403
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,550
software-defined perimeter it uses

404
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,930
certificates and multi-factor

405
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,940
authentication to protect access into

406
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,130
resources like that we're using that

407
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,390
micro segmentation have you heard of

408
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,140
that term before

409
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,850
on on the network side you can have a

410
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,590
big huge Network where everybody's

411
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,590
attached and everybody can see everybody

412
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:16,409
else that's just the way it used to be

413
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,449
in the 90s then this concept of

414
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,720
segmentation happened so you want to

415
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,240
segment your bats your critical stuff

416
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,850
your crown jewels from your normal

417
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,950
servers from your users might have just

418
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,320
a couple of segments there in the new

419
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,480
concept micro segmentation basically

420
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,540
shrinks that bubble protecting your

421
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,059
servers down to just a smaller bubble

422
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,740
around the services that all communicate

423
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,990
together within the bubble they can all

424
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,559
talk outside the bubble you've got

425
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:50,429
protections around firewalls in Amazon

426
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,428
security groups you do it that way what

427
00:20:50,429 --> 00:21:06,750
do you think the benefits are of

428
00:20:53,429 --> 00:21:08,820
shrinking that bubble down any ideas you

429
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,820
can control the access at a more

430
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,129
granular level so you can do like role

431
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,059
based access and not everybody has

432
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:20,160
access to everything the I worked for a

433
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,460
company that was a global prior to this

434
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,799
and I always said why does somebody in

435
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,549
sitting in our office in China have

436
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:32,040
access to our financial servers in New

437
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:34,590
Jersey why that doesn't make any sense

438
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,659
they shouldn't have that access when you

439
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:41,129
put bubbles around things then you can

440
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:45,710
shrink that another one is let's say

441
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:48,750
that a server gets hacked and they start

442
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,309
once you get your foothold in one server

443
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,820
you start looking at all the other stuff

444
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,370
out there

445
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,918
if you can't see outside the bubble then

446
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,360
you can't see all the other stuff so

447
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,010
you're limiting what's called lateral

448
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,100
movement you can't move from server to

449
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:06,059
server to server as easily the other

450
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,280
thing is if if you get an application in

451
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,440
a bubble compromise you're just

452
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,389
compromising that one application not

453
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,710
your entire environment and that's

454
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:18,529
called reducing the blast radius

455
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,690
so if that blows up it's really just a

456
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:22,159
small little hand grenade not a nuclear

457
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:28,130
bomb where your entire company who was

458
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:30,500
this all data and I'm sure you guys have

459
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,880
heard of s3 buckets being exposed

460
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,679
somebody leaves her data out there and

461
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,799
doesn't forgets that they did that and

462
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,320
somebody finds it it's all gone we make

463
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:46,010
sure that our s3 buckets that contain

464
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,439
data are not public Amazon finally after

465
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:54,890
many years agreed to that should be the

466
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:56,840
default we use security benchmarks to do

467
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,809
our configurations and our operating

468
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,500
systems on our environment so we're

469
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:06,559
trying to do just basic best practices

470
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,289
on security as we built this and we're

471
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,789
using multi-factor authentication so if

472
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,750
you're trying to get into our Amazon

473
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:17,000
account to spin up a new server you have

474
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,220
to have multi-factor authentication they

475
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,470
get we have Hardware tokens if you need

476
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:27,169
to do like route type activities another

477
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,649
category was make the systems harder to

478
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:35,960
co-op or own so we do a lot of the

479
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:38,600
encryption just by default Amazon will

480
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,320
encrypt their the discs that go and

481
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,320
servers they'll encrypt s3 buckets we do

482
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,168
a lot of key management and and

483
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,320
encryption on top of that make attacks

484
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:53,779
harder to conceal back to the the

485
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,510
logging point I made earlier we collect

486
00:23:53,779 --> 00:24:01,010
so many more logs now that hiding an

487
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:02,809
attack is really difficult the the one

488
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,669
log that we see the most of is a is

489
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,428
network traffic so any network traffic

490
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:12,559
coming in or out is logged and we see

491
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:14,029
even just real pings up to I'm doing

492
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,129
data transfers we see all that

493
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,169
information for my team

494
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,210
that's great correlation information so

495
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:25,580
that if we know there's an attack we can

496
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:28,010
see all the context around it we also

497
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,389
use a tool on top of that that basically

498
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,940
helps us make sure that

499
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:34,269
we're not doing stupid stuff there there

500
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,769
a cloud operations monitoring tool

501
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:39,070
they'll tell you did you miss configure

502
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:42,039
Amazon or did you miss configure a sure

503
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,869
in in hundreds of different

504
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,609
configuration items so we use that to

505
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:51,439
make sure that we're not again doing

506
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:54,289
stupid stuff we have had a developer try

507
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,719
to spin up an s3 bucket s3 bucket that

508
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,359
was public we have tools that auto

509
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:01,669
remediate that if you're gonna try and

510
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,718
spin up a public s3 bucket we're gonna

511
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:08,119
knock that back down and delete it it

512
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:12,289
was interesting I we were out at a

513
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:14,329
recent AWS security event and that's

514
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,219
that's now standard by most of the

515
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:22,820
financial services company Discover card

516
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:26,359
does the same thing make affects of

517
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,339
attacks and compromises easier to

518
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,279
recover from so we have a forensics tool

519
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:34,039
on all of our servers Linux windows if

520
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,039
there's a server or workstation and you

521
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:41,179
get attacked we can see what happened

522
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,349
contextually with tools also make sure

523
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,709
that there's disaster recovery

524
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:49,700
capability you've got backups ransomware

525
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:51,440
is the the main driver for backups a lot

526
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:57,139
of companies will pay money because

527
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:59,809
their backups didn't work on the

528
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:02,238
governance side I

529
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:05,658
I know another company in Indianapolis

530
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:07,999
that had hundreds of Amazon accounts and

531
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,099
they didn't really know what they had or

532
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:14,029
who owned them or who was paying for

533
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:16,218
them so we made sure that we we have

534
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:19,009
governance and control around standing

535
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:21,139
up new accounts you can't just under our

536
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:26,570
name go stand up into account and spin

537
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:30,349
up and spend money like it's crazy on

538
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:34,309
the improve operations side when you

539
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:37,879
move to the cloud it's the the new

540
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:43,080
language is infrastructure as code so

541
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:45,899
you have what's a pile of code that says

542
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,199
spin up this server I add this load

543
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:53,459
balancer create these security groups

544
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,600
add these roles and add this software

545
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,260
and that's that's how you do stuff these

546
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,120
days it's not plug-and-play and a guy

547
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,580
logging on to a system and downloading

548
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,090
software installing it changing a

549
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,830
firewall it's all infrastructure as code

550
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,649
that was interesting for us on the on

551
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,260
the security side because we're not

552
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:17,760
really coders that's our application

553
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,370
development team right they do the

554
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,120
coding so that was one of our challenges

555
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:28,018
that I'll talk about later no special

556
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,799
snowflakes when you're when you're you

557
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:35,159
got a special application that requires

558
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,929
extra RAM or extra privileges we tried

559
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,149
really hard to basically say yeah no

560
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:42,240
snowflakes follow this standard this

561
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:44,428
template if you want to spend more and

562
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,630
have more CPU that's fine we can do that

563
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:50,960
but you have a standard operating system

564
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,490
and it's it's standard standard standard

565
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,809
the snowflakes are what causes trouble

566
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,210
later on when you're trying to do

567
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,090
application upgrades or infrastructure

568
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,539
replacement or something

569
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:06,178
that's what causes legacy when we made

570
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,960
this move there were some challenges

571
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,100
that we learned about I'm definitely not

572
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:20,909
going to go through these line by line

573
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:22,769
but we learned that for example to

574
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,870
protect stuff in Amazon use what are

575
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:27,720
called security groups they're like a

576
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,039
firewall you say this system conducted

577
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,100
this system on this port in this

578
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,590
protocol but they're not a real firewall

579
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,799
they don't do application based

580
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,178
firewalling they don't do URL filtering

581
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,158
they don't do a sandbox

582
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,750
for malware detection or anything like

583
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:51,059
that so we kind of gave up some features

584
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:55,830
and functionality in this process we

585
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,760
learned that the AWS marketplace where

586
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:03,629
you can buy

587
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:05,910
a software or infrastructure related

588
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:09,330
pieces if you go to Amazon they have a

589
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:11,520
marketplace we would buy a firewall to

590
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,520
help protect this so we've got a

591
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,150
firewall when we bought it we thought it

592
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:22,080
needed this big of a pipe handle this

593
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:25,020
bandwidth of traffic and what we learned

594
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,389
was if you don't plan very well and you

595
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,080
don't over plan it's in some cases it's

596
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:33,780
really hard to scale that you have to

597
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,429
turn it off and restart and when you're

598
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,470
in a production environment and you sort

599
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,020
of change like that you don't like to do

600
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,430
especially in the cloud

601
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,740
why is my application not working how

602
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,030
come I can't get access well the server

603
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,940
wasn't big enough for that

604
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,590
it didn't auto auto scale that's one of

605
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,270
the nice things about the cloud in

606
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,159
general is it Auto scales

607
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:59,760
marketplace didn't do the auto scaling

608
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:02,280
for us some surprises for us in a

609
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,010
firewall if you've ever looked at a

610
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,770
company enterprise wide firewall they

611
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,410
probably have three thousand to ten

612
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:14,070
thousand rules in that firewall for real

613
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:16,530
specific protections to try and limit

614
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,700
who can access what and what ports and

615
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:22,410
protocols we learned that AWS as we were

616
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,780
trying to take our existing firewalls

617
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,720
and take those rules and move them into

618
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,840
Amazon they have limits you can only

619
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:35,610
have let me see what that was you can

620
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:40,110
only have five groups of security rules

621
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,929
per interface which is unbelievably low

622
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:46,020
and then each group can only have now

623
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:48,390
sixty rules so you're really limited on

624
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,180
how you can do some of the firewalling

625
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:53,700
we learned that we learned that there

626
00:30:51,180 --> 00:31:00,900
are workarounds but it was a challenge

627
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:05,220
for us one of the other things that was

628
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:09,210
very challenging for us was a network

629
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,200
IDs or IPs so on the network IDs IPS if

630
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,989
you

631
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,720
have any concept of that you basically

632
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:17,460
take an appliance you you have your

633
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,409
network come in you plug it in and then

634
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,359
it goes through that box and it comes

635
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:24,929
back out and goes through so that

636
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,960
network ids/ips sees if there's a true

637
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:30,809
zoom attacks and the detection system

638
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:36,950
will tell somebody the prevention system

639
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:39,269
will block it in Amazon until just now

640
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:42,029
they didn't have that capability of

641
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:43,919
sticking something in line you don't

642
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:47,309
have a data center where you can say

643
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:51,539
yeah go take this box and plug it in you

644
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:54,119
just can't do that so the reason why we

645
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:56,850
have a requirement for ids/ips

646
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,519
on the network is if you're doing

647
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,408
credit-card transactions and you want to

648
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,629
keep doing credit card transactions you

649
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:07,889
have to have a network IDs that's the

650
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:09,719
regulation so we we had a challenge on

651
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:13,109
how to solve that problem can't just use

652
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:18,720
what Amazon has we had to do some tools

653
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:21,259
on top of that Amazon just in the last

654
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,529
couple weeks announced the beta for a

655
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:27,690
service called AWS mirror so if you sign

656
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,340
up for that you can have your traffic

657
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,139
that goes from point A to point B

658
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:37,949
mirrored somewhere else so you can kind

659
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:40,408
of do an intrusion detection system one

660
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,999
of the other aspects back to the

661
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:46,679
discussion about our regulators

662
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,230
regulators and auditors take a checklist

663
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,210
and they ask you a question are you

664
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,639
doing this if so how are you doing it

665
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,739
give me evidence when we move to the

666
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:57,840
cloud they didn't have that checklist

667
00:32:55,739 --> 00:33:03,809
they don't they don't know what to ask

668
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:05,580
us are you doing this on we're one of

669
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:08,820
the first banks so there's not really

670
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,009
that established well in Amazon you need

671
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,119
to do the following and we need to see

672
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:16,799
the following reports so we've been

673
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,209
trying to figure out how best to provide

674
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,168
the right answers to our regulators to

675
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:24,739
get them comfortable and that's been a

676
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,739
challenge for us

677
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:40,020
we we encountered resource issues when

678
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,540
we meaning people when we tried to

679
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,820
change our development model at the same

680
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,629
time we were trying to move our

681
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,060
infrastructure out of one data center

682
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:52,410
into another so the same people that

683
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:55,980
would normally help architect a solution

684
00:33:52,410 --> 00:34:01,530
were the ones working on moving the data

685
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:04,290
center so we lost some business driven

686
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,389
changes in our applications we had to

687
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,399
basically tell our business side hey

688
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,980
look we know you want to improve our

689
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,730
apps we don't have the resources to do

690
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,730
the migration and make business changes

691
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:23,310
at the same time it takes a lot of

692
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:26,010
people to do that we were working with

693
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,799
third parties that on a normal

694
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,409
environment they would ask for yeah I

695
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,990
need access to this I need this app ID I

696
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:36,929
need this network group that gives me

697
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,459
access to this in the cloud a lot of

698
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,980
these guys didn't know how to tell us

699
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,760
the access they needed so they would

700
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,040
always say well just give me everything

701
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,270
that for us is really hard we we work in

702
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,440
a least privileged role-based

703
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,330
environment so that you only get what

704
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,760
you need tell me what you need and I'll

705
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,850
evaluate that give it to you when they

706
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,620
said yeah just give me everything for us

707
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:06,150
that didn't go and that was causing

708
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:09,480
problems one of the other lessons we

709
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:12,510
learned is we needed a governance model

710
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,390
around this we needed to be able to to

711
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,160
take all of those requests that we're

712
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,990
coming in and figure out how to map that

713
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,020
into Amazon which is a lot different

714
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,270
than an on-prem in the company

715
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,300
environment way to figure out how to

716
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,950
manage our costs so supposedly you can

717
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,940
make you can save a lot of money by

718
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:36,270
moving your assets in Amazon but with

719
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,800
the power of having fast building assets

720
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:41,580
that scale

721
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,099
you can also overspend we had one non

722
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,619
production database that was

723
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:50,009
huge because the application thought

724
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:53,670
they needed more out on old 96 CPUs on

725
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:55,739
that thing what and then they never shut

726
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,859
it off after they realized they didn't

727
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:02,239
need that so our cost increased for one

728
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:04,680
month until we saw that he caught it

729
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,589
again the lease privileges and

730
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,899
separation of duty has been a challenge

731
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:12,779
for us and we had to map out how to fit

732
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,430
that into Amazon Amazon has a different

733
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:18,059
structure than your normal Active

734
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:21,390
Directory for example automation was a

735
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,519
key piece again writing code and doing

736
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,489
things with a button click rather than

737
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,008
having people do stuff was interesting

738
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:30,839
for us and then trying to work with our

739
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:33,119
regulators and develop these controls

740
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:41,339
that make them feel comfortable that

741
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:43,319
we're doing the right thing one of the

742
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:45,779
other challenges we had was finding the

743
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,349
resources that knew what Amazon was and

744
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:52,589
how to best configure infrastructure in

745
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:55,829
Amazon or secure Amazon that was really

746
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:58,229
a challenge for us we we didn't have a

747
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:59,400
lot of resources in Indianapolis we

748
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:00,868
didn't have a lot of resources in

749
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,239
Indianapolis because there's not a lot

750
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:06,299
of other Midwest companies doing stuff

751
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,219
in the cloud so we would look for

752
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:10,380
contractors that were outside Indy to

753
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:12,809
come in and worked on a six month or a

754
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,700
year project for us the resumes looked

755
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:17,519
really good but in some cases we had

756
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,989
people that wrote down really good stuff

757
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,368
but didn't really have the experience

758
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,259
that we were looking for and that was a

759
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,219
challenge we learned that it wasn't just

760
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:25,219
us having that issue

761
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:35,369
the last item one of the things that

762
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:40,849
happens quite frequently in this move to

763
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:40,849
the cloud is I'll get to that later so

764
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:48,930
we definitely hit this I can't do it now

765
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:50,488
I'll get to it later in agile terms

766
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,348
that's called putting it on the backlog

767
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:56,759
it's not something you're gonna get done

768
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:58,060
right now we'll get to it later we did

769
00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:02,380
that way too often

770
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:05,350
and we started to have to put those into

771
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,990
a more official exception process that

772
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,310
did tracking so that it did just sit in

773
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:16,810
a backlog somebody actually had a

774
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:19,870
deadline to get it done some of the

775
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:22,750
changes that in this big loan migration

776
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:24,630
to the cloud process that we did some of

777
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:29,320
the interesting changes that affected us

778
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:32,170
we as I said we talked to our regulators

779
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,510
early that was really good we also

780
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,540
thought at the beginning we have a

781
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,160
dotnet based application environment so

782
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,950
why don't we just move that to Amazon or

783
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,950
sorry to Azure because microsoft.net it

784
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:50,160
would fit well there pretty early on in

785
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:53,560
the process we were convinced that AWS

786
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,529
supports Azure assets and they're

787
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,680
cheaper so we switched from going to

788
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:02,470
Azure to AWS different security tools

789
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,569
different environment so was it a big

790
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:10,839
change on the security team when we were

791
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,900
halfway through we changed who was

792
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,520
actually going to be our operations team

793
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,960
so we thought we were gonna do it

794
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,370
ourselves it's the cloud you don't need

795
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,120
people to do that you just push a button

796
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:25,270
right well we also wanted to have a

797
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,549
third party then do some of the 24 by 7

798
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,350
type activities and we change that in

799
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,300
the middle and when you're trying to

800
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,710
figure out who does what is that the

801
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,080
security team that does that or is that

802
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:39,130
the operations team it threw us into a

803
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:41,350
loop on that after we were done I think

804
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,530
we're changing where our logs go so

805
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:47,980
again two billion events a day worth of

806
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,990
logs is that in one big central or

807
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,090
distributed up amongst the different

808
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,700
Amazon accounts we're still trying to

809
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,800
figure out the best way to do that in

810
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,270
Amazon has changed their best practices

811
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,270
approach on that as well

812
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,080
developers they always want to try stuff

813
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,650
new spin up new things play with new

814
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:11,890
things for us in a bank we can't just

815
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,109
give them data to play with because you

816
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,578
want your data sitting out there in a

817
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:17,558
development environment in the sandbox

818
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,109
so for us it's been a challenge to

819
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:22,599
figure out what can we do in a sandbox

820
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:25,509
we want to make sure that they have the

821
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,099
ability to try new things on the other

822
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:31,599
hand we don't want to expose anything

823
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:33,400
from the bank so connectivity and what

824
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,619
we let them do is is still an ongoing

825
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:42,369
challenge for us upcoming who knows what

826
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:46,000
the term immutability means immutability

827
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:49,000
maybe so we're gonna try to get to what

828
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,720
are either server list where we don't

829
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,079
have servers or immutable servers so

830
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,660
immutability means basically you have an

831
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:03,069
image of a server it's running software

832
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:05,980
and it doesn't change you don't let it

833
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:07,779
change from a security perspective what

834
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:11,769
that means is I can't have malware come

835
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:13,809
in there make modifications and change

836
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,669
the way the system is configured to put

837
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:18,400
backdoors in or something like that I

838
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,339
can't let that happen that's great from

839
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,829
an Operations perspective the the

840
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:26,890
concept of configurations changing on

841
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:28,390
them causing outages causing issues is

842
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,519
something that the operations team has

843
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,609
if they can if the server can't change

844
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:36,609
then those types of issues won't pop up

845
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,380
so we're pushing more for a server image

846
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:40,930
if we have servers that just doesn't

847
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,309
change if it changes blow it away and

848
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,430
spin up a new one with that

849
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:49,599
infrastructure as code that's what we're

850
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:52,690
gonna try and get to I didn't really

851
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:58,059
talk about tagging earlier but Amazon

852
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:59,230
lets you put tags on an asset so you

853
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:01,660
could say it's running this application

854
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,900
the owner is this guy is phone numbers

855
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,940
this the email is this the cost center

856
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,910
that he's in or the department he's in

857
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,859
is this with that department number now

858
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,859
tagged to everything you can start to do

859
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:18,450
really easy charge back so if that

860
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:22,420
developer spins up a database that costs

861
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,740
$1000 a day we charge him not the IT

862
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,230
department

863
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:30,569
so I think that's where we'll end up is

864
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,570
taking those tags and doing chargebacks

865
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,570
our approach has been crawl walk run so

866
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,600
when we first moved everything we went

867
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:43,030
to server in one data center server in

868
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,850
Amazon we're gonna try and get to server

869
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,920
less or containerize some of those

870
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,759
things so we're less focused on the

871
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,150
servers and keeping them patched and

872
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,160
malware free and putting agents and all

873
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,130
sorts of things on them to do that if we

874
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,799
can get out of that that's great

875
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,680
further in the future is this concept of

876
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,000
multi cloud so you have an application

877
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,830
and you can pick it up and move it from

878
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:18,190
Amazon to Azure to Google depending upon

879
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:21,730
cost model or the resources or if Amazon

880
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,570
goes down as you're still up that's

881
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,660
tough

882
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:30,790
it's really tough and it's not cheap but

883
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,649
there's still some worry that what if

884
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,690
Amazon decides they don't want to do

885
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,010
servers anymore

886
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:40,840
they have 33 percent of the business

887
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:42,970
right now and I think a lot of banks so

888
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,770
our regulators are saying gotta have

889
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:55,060
plan B what's your plan B so we'll work

890
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:57,759
on that account strategy the new way to

891
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:00,160
do things and it solves the micro

892
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,030
segmentation piece is to take instead of

893
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,600
having 15 different accounts in Amazon

894
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:11,230
you make it 150 so instead of having

895
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,990
four or five applications in one account

896
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,869
you would then have an account for each

897
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,910
application so we're in the process of

898
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:22,720
doing that I know there's a automotive

899
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,850
company that owns KBB or Edmonds if you

900
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,240
guys ever have a car and you want to see

901
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:33,250
the price you go to KB V Kelly Blue Book

902
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:35,319
they have 800 Amazon accounts 800 that

903
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,480
adds a huge amount if you're trying to

904
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,200
do all that manually but they put all

905
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,940
this code

906
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,100
and spin up a new account have all these

907
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,200
things from a security perspective done

908
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,330
from an infrastructure perspective done

909
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,629
they can you know hit a button and have

910
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:53,980
a new account spin up so the next option

911
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:56,500
is to for us to go into that look much

912
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,150
larger account strategy take all our

913
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,420
applications and make them into a single

914
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:07,300
micro segmented little bubble we're

915
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:09,550
working on that right now if you're in

916
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,320
the process I know you guys probably

917
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:15,010
aren't but this is what you really don't

918
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,990
want to hear it's too hard we hear that

919
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,170
a lot in security I could do that but I

920
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:23,140
don't have time it's too hard or the

921
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:25,570
yeah we'll get to that later or can I

922
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:30,370
have an exception we got we got that out

923
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:32,320
a few times and we feel like in security

924
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:34,089
we're always this way we'll do it later

925
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,630
we'll do it later we'll do it later all

926
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:43,510
 we just got hacked why did you do

927
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:46,300
that okay I'm done talking on the cloud

928
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:48,310
before I go past that what cloud

929
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,650
questions cloud infrastructure cloud

930
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:58,420
security questions you guys have okay

931
00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:01,540
all right so I want to extend that out

932
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,980
just a Tish there is what's called the

933
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,610
Cloud Security Alliance who's heard of

934
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,450
that before

935
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:11,860
cloud security alliance one guy okay so

936
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:14,140
wait I don't know maybe 10 years ago the

937
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,060
Cloud Security Alliance was spun up when

938
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,589
people were worried about going into the

939
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,930
cloud moving their data center to the

940
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:22,650
cloud

941
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:25,359
the Cloud Security Alliance was a

942
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:27,610
national now international organization

943
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,070
that kind of puts together tools if you

944
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:34,090
want to compare Amazon to Microsoft to

945
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:37,450
Google to IBM to Alibaba to Rackspace

946
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:40,210
they have different tools to assess what

947
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:43,689
might meet your needs best

948
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:45,580
they also that SDP concept that I talked

949
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,010
about software-defined perimeter earlier

950
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,810
that came out of actually the Cloud

951
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:52,110
Security Alliance as a as a research

952
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:54,640
project so they worked on

953
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:58,660
related topics and security as a main

954
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,370
focus we have a a regional chapter in

955
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:06,730
the Ohio Valley

956
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:08,980
that we have meetings but we also live

957
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:12,220
stream some of those so for meetings a

958
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,690
year we live stream and it doesn't cost

959
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,980
anything if you guys ever want to

960
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:21,340
participate and learn about cloud

961
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:23,830
security related topics URL and LinkedIn

962
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,560
group if you want to just get on the

963
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:37,330
mailing list type type concept free

964
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:41,950
cloud security well I am I giving you

965
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:45,130
the slides do you want do you guys okay

966
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:49,230
alright and that's how you reach me if

967
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:52,810
you want to from a student perspective

968
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:55,960
just last week my summer intern finished

969
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,960
up so I'm happy to Sally made does

970
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,160
summer interns through the tech point

971
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,530
extern program have you guys heard of

972
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,680
that tech point all right excellent

973
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:09,010
we've had quite a few Purdue grads at

974
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,629
Sallie Mae in our NOC rats students you

975
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,040
through our extern program working at

976
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,700
cell MA and different application

977
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:21,720
development and security roles he just

978
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:24,279
finished up I just talked with a a IU

979
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,939
informatics grad who's now in what's

980
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,860
called the cyber security program at

981
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:37,410
11:50 Academy have you guys heard of

982
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:39,520
1150 Academy yes they're kind of a IT

983
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,000
application development training and now

984
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,100
they just started the security training

985
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,440
where you can basically take and learn

986
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,230
and get certifications on the app dev

987
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,850
side you can do net and some other

988
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,600
language and basically come out of that

989
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:58,210
class ready to to work full-time on the

990
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:00,250
security side you can get an A+ cert and

991
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,560
a network cert and a security cert as

992
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,499
part of the the training class so you

993
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,200
can come out ready to go certified

994
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:10,450
with the right experience that's another

995
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,700
thing that that I'm focusing on is

996
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:16,019
working with those guys to develop their

997
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:19,379
program get security rolled out to

998
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:26,738
individuals okay

999
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:30,579
last any questions hit your button okay

1000
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:32,440
so my question is you said your

1001
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:36,039
developers are following the agile life

1002
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,529
cycles during every sprint or Orsay

1003
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,960
small pushes to the environment before

1004
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:44,589
production just a small testing the

1005
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,450
changes would you have a security check

1006
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:50,650
say during their build cycle or would

1007
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:52,450
you train the developers to be security

1008
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,720
compliant in their application changes

1009
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:58,720
good question so in the waterfall model

1010
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,680
we had them take an annual training

1011
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,808
course on coding security no buffer

1012
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,450
overflows no sequel injection you know

1013
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:11,319
the old wasp top ten type things in the

1014
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:15,879
agile mode we're trying to integrate

1015
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:20,049
tools into the CI CD pipeline that allow

1016
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,479
us to stop the development delivery if

1017
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:26,380
there are security issues so we'll do

1018
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:30,578
source code checking with an application

1019
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:33,400
we will do infrastructure checking with

1020
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:35,739
tools and if they build a server will do

1021
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,769
vulnerability and security configuration

1022
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:41,410
checking before that gets pushed to

1023
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,689
production so it's part of the the

1024
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:45,219
continuous integration continuous

1025
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:50,700
development process does that answer

1026
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:50,700
your question yes it does okay yeah

1027
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:58,239
security drawbacks for instant money

1028
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,450
transfers between banks so the instant

1029
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:05,400
money transfer typically runs on a

1030
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:08,229
platform called Swift there were

1031
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:15,160
instances where Swift actually got

1032
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:19,189
hacked I believe in the East Malaysia or

1033
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,740
Singapore they're one of the bank's lost

1034
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:25,430
eighty million dollars by Swift

1035
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:28,220
transfers yeah that was a threat from

1036
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:30,109
North Korea night darkens with timed it

1037
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,330
with the rest of the bangs for when

1038
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,890
people weren't there yes exactly so

1039
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,870
they're able to transfer that money I

1040
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,370
think they only made nine million out of

1041
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,380
the 80 million but that's still a pretty

1042
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:42,710
large profit yeah they got some of it

1043
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:45,200
back that's why I block every single

1044
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:49,480
packet that comes from North Korea it

1045
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:53,390
doesn't come there actually there's the

1046
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,610
the acronym is o fact OFAC that defines

1047
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:58,520
what the the bad countries are out there

1048
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:01,520
and we're required by our regulators to

1049
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,400
block money transfers or activities with

1050
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:08,480
those countries so I block every packet

1051
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:12,950
coming from Somalia and Yemen and North

1052
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,780
Korea and Iran and Iraq so it makes it

1053
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,339
easier on my side it's less attacks that

1054
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,020
make it through now if I could just do

1055
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,510
the same with Russia and China that

1056
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,640
would really help surprisingly

1057
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:30,650
Netherlands has been really bad at

1058
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:36,560
attacking us lately he's right dpns

1059
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:38,210
france has a ovo v8 OHP as a hosting

1060
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,540
provider and it seems like they take all

1061
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:47,060
the bad guys yeah I could I could talk

1062
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:52,370
for a long time about attacks okay next

1063
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:54,320
question all right so you guys have my

1064
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,000
contact information they ever have any

1065
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,980
follow-ups or or anything

1066
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,980
I don't live too far away

1067
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:06,310
[Applause]

1068
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,700
you
