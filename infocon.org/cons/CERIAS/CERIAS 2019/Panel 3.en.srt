1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,490
so this morning's first panel is on

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,299
securing giant leaps in space

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,830
exploration

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,370
you heard from the last speaker that

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,750
Purdue University is the number-one

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,190
non-military organization for producing

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,740
astronaut so I think it's very fitting

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,509
that we're exploring this today I even

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,759
wore my space tie today if you notice

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,060
it's a it's keeping with the theme so

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,970
we're going well we've got another I

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,250
think outstanding panel today set up for

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,750
us that the moderator is known to

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,840
anybody that's worked in this field

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,730
before professor Dan DeLaurentis he's

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
the director for the Institute of global

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,000
security and defense innovation and a

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,699
professor of Aeronautics and

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,269
Astronautics here at Purdue University

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,550
he's got a long list of accomplishments

21
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,190
behind him and I know that he's been

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,949
sort of the go-to guy in in everything

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,449
Astro Aero here on this campus so rather

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,190
than dwelling on that I'm just gonna go

25
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,170
straight to the panel I'll let Dan

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,519
introduce his colleagues on the panel

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,059
and we'll take it from there

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,670
thank you great Thank You Gerry how's my

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:11,610
microphone working good all right well

30
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:14,280
welcome everyone and it is a great

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,159
opportunity for me to be chairing this

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,600
panel what I found in my faculty career

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,220
over the years is that I've gotten

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,649
better and better at asking questions

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,140
rather than answering them sometimes and

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,060
so I have the pleasure of putting a

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,710
little context out there for the panel

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,299
and then asking some questions of our

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,949
panelists to get things going but

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,229
certainly want to get vigorous

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,860
participation from from all of you in

42
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,979
the audience

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,659
so speaking of cradle of astronauts you

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,970
know my childhood dream was to be an

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,610
astronaut I was

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,170
besides being so fascinated by space I

47
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,060
know my colleague here and I share a lot

48
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,820
of this background

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,610
besides being fascinated by space from

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,559
really as early as I can remember it was

51
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,189
one of the only careers in which my

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:04,649
height was optimized for that occupation

53
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:06,889
so that was good so actually I just just

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,030
a little background in context here I

55
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,470
went to the Florida Institute of

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,780
Technology

57
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,420
shoutout to fi T in Melbourne Florida

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,220
for my undergraduate program because I

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,720
was convinced that the only way I could

60
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,060
become an astronaut was to go to the

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,370
University that was closest to the

62
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,990
Kennedy Space Center so that showed you

63
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,390
sometimes my narrow thinking not

64
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,980
realizing that for a Chicago kid down

65
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,329
the road here in West Lafayette Indiana

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,500
was this wonderful place called Purdue

67
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,610
but life and serendipity did bring me

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,280
back here and it's been a fabulous

69
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,580
journey for me here in Purdue aero-astro

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,150
department the wonderful heritage but

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:52,730
also I think the wonderful

72
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:55,470
forward-looking aspects that we have for

73
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,899
Space Exploration and everything about

74
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,520
space obviously you all know from the

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,370
format of the panels here at the

76
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,130
symposium that we're celebrating our

77
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,930
150th anniversary here at Purdue we're

78
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,630
celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of

79
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,170
Apollo and probably X number of other

80
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,329
anniversaries that I'm missing but

81
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,518
certainly the heritage in space

82
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,410
exploration at Purdue beyond not just

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,050
our aero-astro department some of those

84
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,310
wonderful astronauts that we've had and

85
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,320
some of the innovators that we've

86
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,660
generated from Purdue come from varied

87
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,640
departments and so that's another

88
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,799
testament I think to produce role in

89
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,529
this space but we also I think because

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,739
of this great history we have always to

91
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,060
make sure that we're not focusing too

92
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,730
much on our history but we're also

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,000
focusing on the future and so

94
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,109
anniversaries are those kind of

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,750
double-edged swords if you will or

96
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,810
opportunities is a better word for us to

97
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,030
also look ahead and so thinking about 50

98
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,150
years in the future while the title of

99
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,130
this panel is on space exploration I

100
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,700
think it's fair to say that all the

101
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,769
evidence shows that the next 50 years is

102
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,200
likely to be what really people thought

103
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,060
we were going to get to 50 years ago

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,899
after the great Apollo successes and

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,519
that is not just sending astronauts into

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,209
various places in

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,060
cislunar space but actually as a society

108
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,319
as humanity becoming a species that

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,120
lives and works outside off of the earth

110
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:33,270
so that's the lens I would like to use

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,460
for thinking about this panel and for

112
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,799
the discussion we're going to have

113
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,690
ranging from commerce and space commerce

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,780
on earth that's generated from space

115
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,900
using resources in space to enhance life

116
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,419
on Earth and again ultimately finding a

117
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,150
way for us to have a regular presence

118
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:55,710
for humanity off of this planet and when

119
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,359
you think about it with that lens at

120
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,090
least the way I think about it and when

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,669
I think about that lens we have to do

122
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,650
all the things that we do with every

123
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,889
other aspect of our civilization here on

124
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,669
earth and that is have robust

125
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:13,409
infrastructure have economic and policy

126
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:17,280
constructs that make things work or at

127
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:19,440
least work as well as possible and part

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,659
of that of course is making sure things

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,000
are secured in a manner that's

130
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:26,430
appropriate while also being flexible to

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,650
responding to new opportunities new

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,360
demand signals from the market and all

133
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:36,419
of those things that we care about to

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,400
have a vibrant societal asset in terms

135
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,039
of a new place to do things that we love

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,258
to do as humans so that's the very broad

137
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,289
lens that I'd like us to think about in

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,169
terms of space exploration and I think

139
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,270
we have a panel here that comes from

140
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,979
each of them come from a distinctly I

141
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,990
would say different background which is

142
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,389
exactly the point of a lot of enormous

143
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,240
panel and so what I like to do is is

144
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,580
briefly introduce them really you have I

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,310
think BIOS in the packet but I want to

146
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,979
say a few words about them and then I'm

147
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,669
going to follow that with an initial

148
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,680
prompting question that will be broad

149
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,628
enough to generate I think a lot of

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,129
reactions on the panel and then

151
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,509
we'll move on from there and certainly

152
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:23,679
hope to get the audience participation

153
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,929
as well so sitting on my left is

154
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:29,229
professor Barrett Caldwell professor of

155
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:31,419
industrial engineering and again one of

156
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:34,149
my closest colleagues here ever since I

157
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:36,969
joined Purdue and we've worked on

158
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:39,699
several projects in the other Barrett as

159
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:42,248
you know in in the space exploration

160
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:46,659
area and and so again I think you can

161
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:49,509
see from Barrett's background he brings

162
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,209
a really amazing perspective in my

163
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:56,860
humble opinion in terms of the human

164
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:58,059
factors part of these new activities

165
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,399
that we're going to do in this big

166
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:03,759
vision for space but also I think a

167
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,669
critical look on how information sharing

168
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,089
and information processing plays a role

169
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,889
in that and so I think what you'll find

170
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,050
from Barrett is very much of a

171
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,089
stimulating set of ideas that are going

172
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,919
to cause us to think sometimes less

173
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:21,339
about the physical things that we'll be

174
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,289
doing stuff in space but in many ways

175
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,809
the interactions between them least

176
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,849
that's my hope

177
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:30,789
Dalene Qiu is deputy for technology

178
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,319
programs at Sandia National Labs I had

179
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,188
the opportunity to meet Alan very

180
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,749
recently in person at Sandia and and I

181
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,139
just know from that short interaction

182
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:43,659
that he has sort of a deep background

183
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,719
in areas that relate to national

184
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,490
security in terms of the assets that we

185
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:52,089
have in space especially some of the

186
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,499
electronic and related components of any

187
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,199
of the systems that we're going to be

188
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:58,059
using in fielding but I think his

189
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,269
research background in his research

190
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:02,769
leadership at Sandia really is going to

191
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,819
be a great value add to the conversation

192
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,349
here because of some of the issues that

193
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,259
he knows are out there but some of the

194
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:16,300
mitigations that are on the horizon as

195
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:19,509
well next I believe this Carolin firm my

196
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,450
colleague and aero-astro she's an

197
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:25,120
assistant professor and

198
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,190
in our department and focusing on many

199
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,590
different sort of technology areas in

200
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,400
and around space situational awareness

201
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,500
and our ability to diffuse information

202
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,380
to protect assets and to understand

203
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,299
where assets are etc so again think

204
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,710
about space traffic management just like

205
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,929
air traffic management will be a

206
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,190
critical infrastructure and a critical

207
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,640
activity that we're going to have to

208
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,320
accomplish among many other reasons I'm

209
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,840
wonderfully happy to have Carolyn as a

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,490
colleague just before this I saw her in

211
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,410
the back of the room and I said Carolyn

212
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,400
are you ready to be smart and quippy and

213
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:04,780
she said aren't I always

214
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:08,220
my point was proved and finally cliff

215
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:10,510
Macklin who I'm very excited about

216
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,490
having on our panel because among the

217
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,110
all of our panelists cliff is someone I

218
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,840
haven't met yet so I'm looking forward

219
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,060
to a wonderful set of new ideas from a

220
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,010
colleague that I think is gonna be able

221
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,630
to share a lot for us as you can see

222
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,330
from the bio cliff as an engineering

223
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,960
fellow at Raytheon as any of you know

224
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,700
from our companies that have thousands

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,920
and thousands of employees he's donating

226
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,020
an engineering fellow means that you are

227
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,280
one of the very select few within the

228
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,360
company that have produced a

229
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,550
distinguished record and really beyond

230
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,650
the record it's a person that the

231
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,599
company relies on for new ideas and

232
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,640
charting a course in the future so I'm

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,520
sure cliff will be sharing some of those

234
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,850
ideas with us so with that introduction

235
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,340
of the panel here is the first question

236
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,720
I would like to put on the table and

237
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,970
that is in short in this wonderful world

238
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,180
that we are will be entering in for many

239
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,180
activities in space what could go wrong

240
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,459
let's start with the depressing part

241
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,600
professor Caldwell thanks for starting

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:40,170
with that so when we were talking during

243
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:42,540
the break said I'm not going to talk

244
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,459
about shooting at things I'm not going

245
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,170
to talk about

246
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:55,350
snicking flash drives in my three words

247
00:10:49,170 --> 00:11:00,060
are unresolved stacked over we just had

248
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:02,820
a GPS talk roll over that not everybody

249
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,810
got the memo literally and so there are

250
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:12,600
people who are not appropriately reading

251
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:15,380
their GPS things that's a bad day I mean

252
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,930
we go back to the years and we've got

253
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,990
our men kneel flying around trying to

254
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:27,089
land and we've got alarms their date up

255
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:30,890
the walls fortunately it's a really good

256
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:34,350
pilot flying a really robust machine

257
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:38,069
with a few extra gallons in the tank and

258
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,960
so that stack overflow got there what

259
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,940
happens if we've got a cyst owner

260
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,170
program where people are not in

261
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,650
continuous coms worse yet if we are

262
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:58,939
two-thirds of the way to Mars for 62

263
00:11:52,650 --> 00:12:03,090
Sol's into a Mars exploration you have a

264
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:06,270
space forward architecture so that most

265
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:09,300
of the problem resolution gets solved by

266
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,110
the crew and by the onboard intelligent

267
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,329
agents if they have a stack overflow

268
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,390
they have to start thinking about which

269
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:31,010
data do I support

270
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:35,209
and ground will help that's a very yeah

271
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:38,000
so I would say again you try and foresee

272
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:40,239
the unforeseen but again in a billion

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,620
dollar payload ok satellite payload

274
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,680
you're dealing with latent hardware

275
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,490
component failures that or just despite

276
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,019
your best efforts for qualification and

277
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,220
screening you're dealing with a very

278
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:57,910
harsh environment so some of these are

279
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,079
you know detectable and through

280
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,519
qualification but many times actually

281
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,010
you're dealing with just small

282
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,649
quantities of components right and we

283
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,140
all know how Intel and the semiconductor

284
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,240
business works is its massive volumes

285
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,800
but when you're dealing with very small

286
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,529
quantities you're dealing with

287
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,839
components that could possibly fail and

288
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,170
they have failed so certainly that's the

289
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,430
major concern okay and your customers

290
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,740
don't like hearing you know if

291
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,969
something's not working and again that's

292
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,209
the idea we try and figure out ways to

293
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,279
fix that likewise I would say flight

294
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,930
software again despite your best efforts

295
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,510
to make sure that your flight software

296
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:38,540
you've exercised various different

297
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,519
scenarios again things happen right it

298
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,670
to the extent that you gets locked in a

299
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,350
particular mode where you no longer can

300
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,110
point your telescope at a particular

301
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:52,100
area of interest to the extent that

302
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:54,649
again you do your best to do ample

303
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,399
testing but things go Murphy's Law

304
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,399
things go wrong

305
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,540
so I thought when I first heard dan

306
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,040
asking a question I thought one thing we

307
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,540
have to realize that space is a

308
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,779
different domain than what we are used

309
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,890
on earth who won autonomy is not a

310
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:22,200
choice okay so we are relying on highly

311
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,240
autonomous systems sometimes in the

312
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,089
percentage we have onboard astronauts

313
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,950
and they can do a few things but they

314
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:36,610
are extremely limited so we we are

315
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,910
relying on an autonomous system and in

316
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,910
order to run that we have to communicate

317
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,130
with it okay it's not a choice my

318
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,569
admission is not gonna successful if I

319
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,550
just send it up and never communicate

320
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,250
with them that's our definition of space

321
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,219
debris that so we have to keep a

322
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,510
communication channel open and that

323
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:01,480
automatically makes the system

324
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:05,250
vulnerable we know so as we are so so

325
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,839
far away from these things

326
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,020
scenarios as for example software

327
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,730
updates are very different it was maybe

328
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,350
the first time we had a similar scenario

329
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,110
on earth when we were talking about the

330
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,410
Nike shoe failure right the self tying

331
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,350
shoes I was a software update to start

332
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,459
them and that destroyed your I don't

333
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:31,240
know $300 sneaker and that was a big

334
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:32,859
shock for people here but that is kind

335
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,110
of the dimension of economic failure

336
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,329
that you have this is not an unknown

337
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,649
failure in in space that you change the

338
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,829
software you have to update something

339
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:44,560
and then there is no way of recovering

340
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:47,739
it and that that that leads to two

341
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,510
physical failure of your system to the

342
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,810
death of your of your satellite similar

343
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,270
to the Nike shoes that is not as rare

344
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:59,290
scenario as we have it here on earth but

345
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,540
a more common scenario the other thing

346
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,480
we have to keep in mind is we already

347
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:10,240
heard kind of the physical environment

348
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:12,670
it also means we are operating boxes

349
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,640
or computer towers flying around with

350
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,459
several kilometers per second okay I've

351
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,649
kind of bullet speed that means if

352
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,050
something goes wrong something breaks

353
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:29,040
off it's gonna damage or maneuver into

354
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,040
something else it's gonna damage wrong

355
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:50,220
that's a failure failure impact and

356
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,319
things like that and my saying is

357
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,240
usually you know nothing works unless

358
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,010
you make it work everything comes broken

359
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,429
right nothing just just starts to work

360
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,839
right so if you say nothing what what

361
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:17,170
can go wrong the first question I would

362
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,579
ask it's similar to what they what he

363
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,900
was discussing earlier with that green

364
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,849
and red slide seems like everyone paid

365
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,559
attention to that slide so those first

366
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,389
two steps being super critical

367
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,369
so my background again is embedded

368
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,720
systems a lot and cyber security in

369
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,100
terms of getting cyber security and

370
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,200
weapon systems and things like that

371
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,870
the first step is understanding what is

372
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,120
what are you expecting to get right and

373
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,350
I think that's a just to reiterate was

374
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,570
talked about earlier is that's the

375
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,000
critical step is to understand if you're

376
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:46,870
what are you what kind of risk are you

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,250
willing to willing to take on this a lot

378
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,260
of the contract that work that I do

379
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,330
you'd like to believe that cyber

380
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,490
security on on some of our systems is

381
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,960
gonna be like you're gonna spend you

382
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,700
know billions of dollars it is the

383
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,380
government after all so they must spend

384
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,630
they'll be willing to spend billions

385
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,990
dollars on everything and that's not the

386
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,240
case right these contracts are very cost

387
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,750
and schedule sensitive and cyber

388
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,690
security very often is a at this point

389
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,090
is a unwelcome guest very often right

390
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,400
then you're trying to put a radar in the

391
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,620
radar in a plane the idea is that it

392
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,780
finds targets and it helps you maneuver

393
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,709
and so on and so forth the idea isn't

394
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,360
that I have

395
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,240
function on there to text an intruder

396
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,908
and and that's not the really the focus

397
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,159
of what that product is for so again it

398
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,289
comes down to when I look at that even

399
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,210
in space whatever those systems might be

400
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,220
what are the what is their what is your

401
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,929
risk appetite and what are you trying to

402
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,070
accomplish you know some of the things

403
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,750
when you look at space from a cyber

404
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,059
curious cyber security perspective and

405
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,500
you start talking about I mean putting

406
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,570
people on another planet and things like

407
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,710
that and interacting you know one of the

408
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,928
things that we take advantage of

409
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,179
obviously in in everyday life and that

410
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,890
we're used to is the paradigm of being

411
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,870
able to authenticate when I can reach

412
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,750
out and touch that person right here

413
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,760
that that physicality is a is a huge way

414
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,620
of how we make sure things are real

415
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,179
right everybody's heard of the red what

416
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,100
red pill blue pill well if you have a

417
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,649
whole society somewhere else and all

418
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,010
your connection is through this network

419
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:17,408
of Technology and so on the

420
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,149
possibilities of what could go wrong or

421
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,559
that seem to be almost endless when you

422
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,350
start talking about the motivations

423
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,210
relative to financial nevermind the loss

424
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,320
of life and and what's going on and you

425
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,510
talk about with the elections and

426
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,549
undercutting confidence you could

427
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,470
imagine the impacts of attacking a

428
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,658
system like that when you talk about the

429
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,549
magnitude of investment as well as the

430
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,860
the national pride and all the other

431
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,559
things that are wrapped around that so I

432
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,449
would talk about what can go wrong I

433
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,950
really say okay what are we looking what

434
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,950
are we expecting to get first right

435
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,419
so speaking of sort of understanding you

436
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,299
know what could go wrong and what's

437
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,049
expected to go right I'm thinking back

438
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:07,059
first

439
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:10,889
to the Apollo this really fascinating

440
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,870
feature out right now called Apollo 11

441
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:14,379
it's in the movie theaters anyone anyone

442
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,330
okay

443
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,570
not once not many I strongly recommend

444
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:28,809
it I took my six-year-old son to it I

445
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:33,010
think fascinated and a focus it is not I

446
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:34,809
wanted to find the right word okay it's

447
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,779
it's not a dramatization it's not a

448
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,928
Hollywood flick it's a basically an hour

449
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,090
and a half long compilation of real

450
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:46,090
footage from the mission

451
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,769
you know from the from the capsule and

452
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,740
what the astronauts were doing and prior

453
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:52,480
to launch how they were getting ready

454
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,399
they're only really sort of voiceover is

455
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,399
Walter Cronkite but that's act his

456
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:02,830
actual voice over from the so really

457
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:04,870
fascinating and just time after time

458
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,139
every critical function every critical

459
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,029
part was actually going as expected now

460
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:12,908
we know later Apollo programs had

461
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:14,409
something different but even though they

462
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:16,720
were going into a relatively unknown

463
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,580
environment of course we we were at the

464
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,320
moon before Apollo 11 right he just

465
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,210
didn't land on it there was a very

466
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,730
well-defined I think in a lot of

467
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,220
Engineers and a lot of people

468
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,409
contributed to that one of the reasons

469
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,990
actually as an aside we're so proud of

470
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,789
Neil Armstrong as a Purdue alum is that

471
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,950
as you saw from when he returned from

472
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:37,960
the mission and the rest of his life he

473
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,299
always deflected the praise to the

474
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,799
people not only his fellow crew mates

475
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,679
but the people on the ground the

476
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:47,190
thousands of people in Houston and

477
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,470
everywhere else and the corporate

478
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,049
community that contributed anyway so

479
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,179
everything went well so take that and

480
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,210
building on Clips comment about how do

481
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,780
we deal with these

482
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:03,300
so now let me imagine 30 years from now

483
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,310
we have a permanent commercial presence

484
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,200
on the moon I want you all to visualize

485
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,480
this because you're on them I have to

486
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,960
react to it here shortly we have

487
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,060
multiple corporations and some

488
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,770
government operations taking place on

489
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,230
the moon there's a mining operation

490
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:23,129
that's the core of this vibrant

491
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:25,470
commercial activity and there's a

492
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,510
vibrant set of hotels in cislunar space

493
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,400
that are transiting people there's

494
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,460
Torres there's workers coming to the

495
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,060
surface lots billions and billions of

496
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,920
dollars are being made and prosperous

497
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,280
things are happening and then all of a

498
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,820
sudden on a sunny side of the Moon

499
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:52,980
Monday morning they discover a strange

500
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:59,700
black object 1 by 4 by 9 I expected more

501
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:01,710
laughter and shortly after that it

502
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,810
really didn't get reported anywhere but

503
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,840
shortly after that all called the

504
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,980
critical communications between that

505
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,230
presence on the moon and the earth

506
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,840
although many of the operations and even

507
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,770
the economic transactions of all go

508
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,139
haywire and there are multiple countries

509
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:26,570
operating also on the lunar surface at

510
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:29,400
this time and so how would you bear it

511
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:39,480
go about figuring out what went wrong

512
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:42,660
you owe me a beer after well I think ok

513
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,840
so one of the first issues that that I

514
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:50,870
would say is that everyone on this lunar

515
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,850
Enterprise Zone if you will had been

516
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:57,090
issued as part of their standard

517
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,810
deployment pack a copy of Heinen's the

518
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,810
moon is a harsh mistress

519
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,850
and one of the reasons is that actually

520
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,710
it's not that far off from one of the

521
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,860
scenarios that it's being played out in

522
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,970
hein ones book and this is obviously a

523
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:18,178
few years before

524
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:21,950
Kubrick took his shot the people who are

525
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:25,679
up there we'll start out with

526
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,690
representation and alignment with the

527
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,799
corporation or the nation that they

528
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:37,019
started with they will evolve fairly

529
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:41,190
quickly into a different orientation to

530
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:45,750
being whatever phrase they use lunatic

531
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:48,870
comes to mind to say we're in this

532
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,960
together and no one down there is going

533
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,840
to help us as much as us up here even if

534
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,679
you're from a competing country even if

535
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,320
you're from a competing corporation

536
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:06,259
especially if you then tell us that we

537
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:10,710
are not going to get any more edicts or

538
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:13,080
insights or recommendations from the

539
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,539
Home Office as long as this obelisk is

540
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,129
here they are going to have to figure

541
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:21,570
out how they're going to work together

542
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:22,590
how they're going to do local comm local

543
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,649
interactions

544
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:29,689
I don't know putting together regular

545
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:31,408
with for a little standing stone signals

546
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,090
but they're going to have to work

547
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:37,649
together and they're going to have to

548
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:40,580
have that sense of a local culture that

549
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:42,719
transcends wherever they came from

550
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,289
specifically to deal with these sorts of

551
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,289
interruptions

552
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:57,740
you still get culture well I guess again

553
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,600
with a kind of more of a nefarious mind

554
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,810
you know one would want to make sure

555
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,370
that all communications of all countries

556
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:08,060
are knocked out and it wasn't maybe a

557
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,939
suspicious implant by an adversary so

558
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,879
again you know you're dealing certainly

559
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,040
with any number of possibilities you

560
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,480
know could have been an EMP event that

561
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,040
could have knocked out all the

562
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,830
electronics so again provided let's say

563
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,290
you get the benefit of doubt that it was

564
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,449
something of an alien nature certainly

565
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,220
there would be in lines formed and we

566
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,500
certainly would want to interrogate it

567
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,900
and make sure that if it's giving off

568
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,440
certain emissions that disabled all the

569
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,900
you know capabilities abroad

570
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,650
yeah III would agree we would take a

571
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,140
unified front to certainly understand

572
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:50,810
and figure out what can be done and

573
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:55,690
maybe perhaps communicate with it to the

574
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,690
extent of maybe scenes out of you know

575
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,170
yeah I mean you put out these scenarios

576
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,590
so for one I think we do not have to kid

577
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,420
ourselves even in that scenario you're

578
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,870
not self-sufficient on the Marinette at

579
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,790
that point sure you're looking if

580
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,469
communication and transportation of

581
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,990
goods cannot be established in that

582
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:29,210
scenario we're looking at death of the

583
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:31,640
community on the moon I would go briefly

584
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:36,200
into kind of a philosophical viewpoint

585
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,150
here I would say no alliances formed but

586
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,130
more with Thomas Hobbes that life is

587
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,220
brutish and short and that kind of the

588
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,200
strongest ones will survive I think

589
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,510
there will be a very nasty time on the

590
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,380
moon

591
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:53,390
weaker parts are suppressed hunger games

592
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,630
yeah it's got some kind of more

593
00:27:53,390 --> 00:28:02,630
tech-savvy small alliance of a handful

594
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:06,890
of people will trying to solve it on the

595
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,360
technical level maybe most or the

596
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,620
best-equipped ones from their home

597
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,649
country will take all the other ones use

598
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:22,689
this eaters at this point so I have a

599
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:26,090
bit more kind of negative view on that

600
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,850
when we want to tie it to kind of

601
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,429
nowadays we are looking into making

602
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,219
further moon missions as it looks at the

603
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:40,760
moment and maybe it's worthwhile to make

604
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:43,670
a comparison the computational

605
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:47,050
standpoint I mean we have even on the

606
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:49,940
old phones which were not start forming

607
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:52,100
similar computation power that what we

608
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,140
put on there on the Apollo mission okay

609
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,000
so that means the computation that that

610
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:02,210
we did and the software that we employed

611
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,350
we're very different the time we were

612
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:09,020
still did computing on the cards and

613
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:12,770
remember okay when we're doing missions

614
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:16,310
now it will be very different and I

615
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,070
think it will also make us more you can

616
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,800
do more things we can do that much

617
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,929
better in a sense but we also see we

618
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,080
make new mistakes if we're looking at

619
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:30,980
the Boeing max at the moment I mean that

620
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,770
was a way of giving more autonomy to the

621
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,750
system and we can do that because we

622
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,510
have better computational power but then

623
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,770
we are leading also into new failures

624
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:45,680
that the Apollo mission could not have

625
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:48,080
computation we're on such lower level at

626
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,590
that point we're also going to do that

627
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,820
not with one big spaceship but most

628
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,740
likely we will do that

629
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,649
was kind of a swarm of smaller

630
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,490
satellites kind of one bigger part

631
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,700
carrying the ass

632
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:05,100
swarming satellites which are supported

633
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,840
that's a much better way of doing it if

634
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:11,040
it works properly it's more robust

635
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,470
however it also makes it a lot more

636
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,020
vulnerable any communication I mean I

637
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,480
have wireless communication between the

638
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,330
parts of the satellites that means that

639
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,810
also communication I can kind of tap

640
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,939
into small satellite has very limited

641
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,399
capabilities Hey

642
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,910
makes it also harder to put on more

643
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:35,460
security on the other hand I have a cube

644
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,500
in space maybe you can maneuver a little

645
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,630
bit it has a large velocity so I can

646
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,930
still use it kind of as a physical

647
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:46,110
impactor if I want to just do damage to

648
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:48,180
it so I think thinking about the old

649
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:53,070
Apollo days is it's good but we're in a

650
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:54,600
much different place nowadays so what he

651
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,030
said this thing shows up there's no

652
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,389
communication and what do I do now right

653
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,530
so this is the kind of conversation that

654
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,490
that you would have before you've

655
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,410
actually put people on the moon

656
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,420
hopefully right so this would be the

657
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,570
this would be the state of trying to

658
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,300
figure out what what you need to go

659
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,280
right alright so if if we were having

660
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,570
hopefully this conversation if it just

661
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,300
happened once you've already up there

662
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,220
I will send everyone else first - right

663
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,800
if this is this this is the approach but

664
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,290
if if you've had this conversation

665
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,120
already it really comes down it's really

666
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,620
similar to what I consider you know just

667
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,350
regular architecture when you're dealing

668
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,879
with CPUs and things like that you lose

669
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,350
communication but in and of itself

670
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,110
that's information for people on earth

671
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,480
so you have an idea of you a protocol

672
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,090
between I would expect that you haven't

673
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,800
had this conversation a priori right

674
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,360
that you have a you have the idea of a

675
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,470
protocol right you'd have to you'd have

676
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,240
to know if you're not gonna be

677
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,710
self-sufficient with a certain

678
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,780
particular population you can limit the

679
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,150
population size based on what the

680
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,590
resources are you'd have a projection of

681
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,540
how many days you can actually survive

682
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,220
and your protocol would have 15 layers

683
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,870
of redundancy in other words I'm sending

684
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,180
things up there or physically making

685
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,889
that connection within a within a

686
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,100
quarter of that time if something goes

687
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,620
wrong right so I think it really you

688
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,179
know if your original question was how

689
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,850
do you debug the kind of what's

690
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,500
why'd you lose communication probably in

691
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,209
that kind of disaster recovery situation

692
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,130
there's probably another protocol of

693
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,480
survival first and then figuring out

694
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,770
later or just re-establishing

695
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,330
communication regardless if I have a

696
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,730
bunch of junk flying in the air that I

697
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,080
was supposed to be using to communicate

698
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:31,560
re-establishing that communication right

699
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,480
so I think this this is the it's it's

700
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,820
it's the it's the perfect question to

701
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,440
ask beforehand and it's often when I

702
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,450
work with customers sometimes and they

703
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,730
come in because cybersecurity is off

704
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,340
obviously something that people can't

705
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,630
easily measure often it really comes

706
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,220
down to what you expect to happen

707
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,010
correctly and the risk that you're

708
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,300
willing to take it's it's exact exactly

709
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,070
that question that I'll have with them

710
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,360
about well this is your architecture and

711
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,679
this is your this is how you think the

712
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,209
system's gonna run and they haven't

713
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,190
asked questions like that a priori

714
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,240
sometimes and you go and they tell you

715
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,560
how it's gonna work you say well then

716
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
you're okay with this happening well no

717
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,470
of course not I'm not okay with that

718
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,850
happening if all the communication comes

719
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,260
out and everybody dies in a week I'm not

720
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,060
happy with that well that's what your

721
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,590
architecture has right now built into it

722
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,980
I mean it's just you're not trying to

723
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,600
architect for this specific scenario so

724
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,250
it is a good place to start even from

725
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,179
when you're looking at cybersecurity and

726
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,070
trying to help somebody with their

727
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,650
system and you ask them what people

728
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,710
don't know about lease privileged access

729
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,360
you know protecting access and all these

730
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,770
it's defense-in-depth

731
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,330
and all these are basically a different

732
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,310
language to people a lot of people who

733
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,840
don't deal with cybersecurity but that

734
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,340
kind of question right there when you go

735
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,320
they know what they want to protect

736
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,570
though they know what bad behavior looks

737
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,740
like and if you if you pose it that way

738
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,800
very often okay you have this

739
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,050
information and it may go away for three

740
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,639
days because of X Y Z or you you may

741
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,230
lose this capability completely when

742
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,850
this goes out you're okay with that

743
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,230
that's alright and then that

744
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,000
conversation starts talking about

745
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,250
building that protocol and building the

746
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,920
systems and responses at the at the

747
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,270
detailed level and at the CPU ASIC level

748
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,010
in terms of what you what you're doing

749
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,389
from a system standpoint all the way up

750
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:07,290
to the strategy for the overall system

751
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,179
right so hopefully there's a plan before

752
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,759
you get there

753
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:14,850
so as I'm listening I do want to add one

754
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,140
more piece and Caroline I actually now

755
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:21,540
understand how dark dark can be and also

756
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,259
so I'll ask you again the next time I

757
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,389
need

758
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:30,890
but but no but know that there's a

759
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:34,400
really serious issue here about what do

760
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:38,659
we do and do we try to solve the problem

761
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,280
do we try to detect an isolate and

762
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,859
recover the problem according to our

763
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,120
standard mechanisms or do a bunch of

764
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:53,590
people go out and kick dirt until it

765
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:56,299
says okay land food here in the dust and

766
00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:00,770
you can still have a telescope that sees

767
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,140
that and so when we think about what is

768
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:07,550
our response our response should be to

769
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:30,259
set up robust alternatives not just to

770
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:33,560
dig down into whatever we had before I

771
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,720
think you know we kind of documented

772
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,970
there's a lot that could go wrong I

773
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,250
think the word infinite was used and

774
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,350
that's probably the case but then cliff

775
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,790
and then embarr it started talking about

776
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,549
what are we gonna do about it you know

777
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,779
be prepared look at your architecture

778
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,270
and I think what you were trying to say

779
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,920
is also there's the robustness to the

780
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,470
scenarios you haven't thought of right

781
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,400
barek anything else the panel wants to

782
00:35:54,470 --> 00:36:01,310
share I'd like to add one more point on

783
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:04,250
what to do about it and that is I think

784
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:07,070
this future in space will be one in

785
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:10,400
which no single entity owns all the

786
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:14,180
assets and so a strict sort of command

787
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,680
and control and operations model you

788
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,049
know it's probably not going to be

789
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,569
present so with that lens any thoughts

790
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:24,400
on what we can do better in terms of

791
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,400
mitigations and adaptations

792
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:41,990
harsh radiation environment so you know

793
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,700
redundancy helps but probably you would

794
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,229
also be interested in you know

795
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,259
collecting data analytics what are the

796
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:51,109
symptoms of the other you know

797
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,540
counterpart systems to arrive at whether

798
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:55,690
it might be specific to you know the

799
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,339
nature of the architecture or some other

800
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,799
parameter with respect to doing

801
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:03,109
Diagnostics and again you know if the

802
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:04,309
failure modes are all common then you've

803
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:08,200
got a serious problem

804
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:08,200
you know maybe they alien nature

805
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:18,950
well alright why don't we have some

806
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:21,620
audience participation start off some

807
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,870
reaction for questions they could be I'm

808
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,089
sure the panelists would field anything

809
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:49,160
from technology questions to philosophy

810
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:52,670
questions to science ok thanks for a

811
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,759
very interesting discussion of this

812
00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:00,440
space domain so the problems that you

813
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:11,870
are defining fairly generic

814
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:13,880
you know early robust but these these

815
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,259
are genetic problems so are they what

816
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,640
would be a research agenda let's say I

817
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,740
want to start a new program research

818
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,210
program can you articulate a few

819
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:27,830
fundamental problems that are specific

820
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:30,740
to space in this area I can start yeah

821
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:34,790
thanks we don't know how to launch

822
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:41,839
Mission Control right now

823
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:47,180
every C cert every response team every

824
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:50,810
group we have is very human heavy we

825
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:55,220
don't know how to create intelligent

826
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:58,730
agents that are effective teammates with

827
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:01,189
a small number of humans that we can

828
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,260
split out some of the functionality but

829
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:08,720
we are not having a fight over control

830
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,880
so one of the questions is if I've

831
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,149
gotten actually I'm thinking about this

832
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,090
right and now for some projects how in

833
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:20,910
the world am I going to get agents that

834
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:24,870
know how to communicate with the crew

835
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:27,690
in reducing a whole bunch of data and

836
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:33,480
turning it into effective teammate

837
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:36,810
information and it's really hard to go

838
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,030
it's really hard to stay on Mars if we

839
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,960
don't have that capability because you

840
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:52,020
cannot rely on the ground to save you at

841
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:53,850
12 white minutes one way thank you so

842
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,890
when you say you know what's the weather

843
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,540
there's some research areas I mean we've

844
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,850
talked about some kind of generic

845
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:03,060
problems too right so one of the things

846
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,950
I would be asking first you know is what

847
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,509
is the specific problem that you're

848
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,250
trying to deal with right so if we

849
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,520
specifically talked about the

850
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:14,370
communications issue right in terms of

851
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,690
the availability of communications and

852
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,720
then there's the other aspect that he

853
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,370
brought up about that being working for

854
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,080
the aerospace and defense the idea of

855
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:26,700
sharing sharing isn't as as as

856
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,500
comfortable for me as far as

857
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,160
infrastructure and things like that in

858
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,320
space so if you if you tackle for

859
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,799
example the sharing of infrastructure in

860
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,360
space how do you give in a particular

861
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,110
functionality that you support assuming

862
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:45,870
it's not national security-related

863
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,130
as far as you know detecting missiles

864
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,790
and these kind of things intelligence

865
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,710
and those kind of things how do you

866
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,140
share infrastructure in a trustworthy

867
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,760
manner and what are the aspects of of

868
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,900
how you'd go about doing that I think

869
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,370
there's some very positive things about

870
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,900
it because obviously as far as this

871
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,850
example that you flew out from a

872
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,990
communication standpoint there's a and I

873
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,520
think someone else had mentioned there's

874
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,470
a vested interest in everybody making

875
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,480
sure it still works but there's also the

876
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,609
aspect of being an it being available to

877
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,440
everybody as well and you've got code

878
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,350
from possibly multiple different places

879
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,270
that are different levels of trust and

880
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,120
things like that so how do you how do

881
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:23,520
you create a an infrastructure that is

882
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,660
shared but at the same time trusted to

883
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,210
provide the service that you're

884
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,370
expecting out of it I think is a would

885
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,320
be would be a bit of a challenge and

886
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,270
this is best victim space this arises

887
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,710
this provides saying specifically the

888
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,680
reason why I think space is

889
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,050
is a is a big deal is like I said I

890
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,460
think you know one of the one of the

891
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,780
things that you do in networks a lot

892
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,970
right is for authenticity you well

893
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,890
there's two aspects of this for for this

894
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,569
particularly I do not deal with system

895
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,339
I've never I don't see a lot of systems

896
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,900
that are mission-critical like this is

897
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,650
mission critical in some fashion right

898
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:01,260
that as far as the defense and aerospace

899
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,030
where we we share even if we do share

900
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,520
there's other ways if that doesn't work

901
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,109
right generally right so if you're gonna

902
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,280
actually be in a situation where you're

903
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:12,839
sharing and it's mission-critical

904
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,490
there's there's a high level of trust

905
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,859
that's going to be required and that's

906
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,569
hard to achieve in a situation where you

907
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:21,230
don't control all the aspects of that

908
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:23,550
individual that piece right so that's a

909
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,200
how that works how you make that work

910
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,230
exactly I think would be a pretty hard

911
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,220
problem right so in and space I think

912
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,359
adds some new new challenges to that you

913
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,310
know one of the things that is you know

914
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,690
having a de band like certificate

915
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,830
authorities and things like that to do

916
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,420
authentication all these kind of things

917
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,400
you know it's easy to say well I got a

918
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,540
fallback of physical the physical aspect

919
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,210
of getting things to where I need them

920
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,710
to be but because everything is not you

921
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,390
don't have that physical aspect and

922
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:51,050
you've got this other party sitting on

923
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,160
your on your machine that can now

924
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,930
subvert maybe the functionality and

925
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,640
things like that it's a it's a different

926
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,259
problem right so for example if you

927
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,210
think think of like Spector and meltdown

928
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,849
right specter and meltdown are issues

929
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,800
because people can running code on the

930
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:06,330
system can do things to the system to

931
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
take advantage of the shared resources

932
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:09,990
on that particular system and not the

933
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,629
system itself but the processor itself

934
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,040
right in this type of environment you

935
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,810
could very easily see having code of

936
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,490
multiple people and now that that that

937
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,130
particular vulnerability becomes more

938
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:22,319
relevant than if only my code can run on

939
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,210
that system right so these are the kind

940
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,770
of things that you there's a lot of

941
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,940
problems I think to solve with shared

942
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,730
infrastructure especially if it's

943
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,589
mission-critical yeah and I'm just gonna

944
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:34,080
add also I think to do it in a

945
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:36,930
cost-effective and insertion ease

946
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:42,630
standpoint I mean right costs and time

947
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:44,490
in terms of you know designers wanting

948
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,020
to incorporate that because I mean the

949
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,720
whole thing about trusted systems is

950
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,490
there's an insertion cost right

951
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,890
and the bottom line is is that you've

952
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:55,939
got scheduled and these billion dollar

953
00:44:51,890 --> 00:45:00,529
programs that again exceedingly just

954
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,790
have extreme pressures so so again you

955
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,430
know we look at our commercial

956
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,279
counterparts right SpaceX and so forth

957
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:10,640
how they've been able to expediently

958
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,740
deploy their their systems so right so I

959
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,348
think there's there's a lot that you

960
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,259
know government can learn probably from

961
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:19,790
how the commercial side is getting more

962
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,109
in the business on the other hand I

963
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,690
think there's a lot of government

964
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:25,460
regulations imposed on safety and I'm

965
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,750
not saying that commercial entities

966
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,240
don't have to do that I'm just saying

967
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,880
they don't have as much of the red tape

968
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,680
and bureaucracy and I think again

969
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,900
elements of automation in terms of

970
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,990
flight mission planning because again

971
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:42,530
these take months to years versus

972
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,910
incorporating more autonomy to have

973
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,589
things that could be done in a quicker

974
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:55,660
timeframe because because again it boils

975
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:58,730
down to cost and money thinking about

976
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:03,980
inter satellite communication just

977
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:06,349
cannot just have a specific what are

978
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,910
ways of communication that work under

979
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:12,670
those extreme constraints of

980
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:12,670
computational power very small processor

981
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:27,859
specific range more batteries what

982
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:30,109
communication works higher autonomy on

983
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:35,500
that as was mentioned before another

984
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:38,450
specific problem how can we have

985
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,320
external information on it if we are

986
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,710
losing

987
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:46,790
communication telescopes radio or other

988
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:49,160
systems and figure out things about the

989
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:54,430
satellite so let me know okay which

990
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,430
direction is not pointing that we can

991
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:06,830
okay thanks I just like to say wonderful

992
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:10,339
presentation I love the 2001 references

993
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:14,450
that's excellent enjoyable but

994
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:17,300
terrifying mr. Magwood I talking about

995
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:20,240
in regards to cybersecurity applications

996
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,940
on say theoretical human mission to Mars

997
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,470
you know back and forth you're not so

998
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,150
worried about someone sniffing reports

999
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,370
you know breaking in stealing your stuff

1000
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,500
you're for my meds from Earth it's not

1001
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:32,509
gonna happen but how would you go about

1002
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,880
designing a system architecture that's

1003
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,970
designed less to protect from outside

1004
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,550
influences and more to protect the

1005
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:44,209
system from itself while working while

1006
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:46,370
presenting a way for highly-trained

1007
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:49,040
laypeople who aren't necessarily cyber

1008
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:51,140
security experts to correct system

1009
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,380
errors when it goes about basically a

1010
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,390
self-correcting you know different tools

1011
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,310
for self correcting problems within the

1012
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,509
system so a catastrophic meltdown

1013
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:04,700
doesn't happen and everybody dies so

1014
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:06,080
yeah so as far as I mean there's a lot

1015
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,270
of issues I mean I understand the idea

1016
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,670
of you're saying for sniffing ports and

1017
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,930
things like that for entry right but so

1018
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,820
you're worried about integrity is huge

1019
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:16,640
right for what you're for what you're

1020
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,770
worried about there so how do you keep

1021
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,299
it up and running and not have a cyber

1022
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,980
security expert sitting on board

1023
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,120
analyzing everything as you go I think

1024
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,140
it's kind of what you're saying just

1025
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:29,810
reiterating okay okay so I think from an

1026
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,520
from a from a from an architectural

1027
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,279
standpoint you know you're talking about

1028
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,230
trying to build in a kind of aided

1029
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,700
resilience kind of thing right so it's

1030
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,130
not like it's completely autonomously

1031
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,460
gonna continue to run on its own and

1032
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:45,650
monitor everything and and be able to

1033
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,900
self-heal and and and move forward and

1034
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,130
you're saying just with some help so I

1035
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,650
think the keys in that kind of

1036
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,520
environment is first of all from an

1037
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,890
architectural standpoint

1038
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,900
you want to be able to create some slop

1039
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,420
is what I would call it I'm relative to

1040
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,830
your ability to to fix things so you

1041
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,420
definitely going to have to deal with

1042
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,779
some level of redundancy and things like

1043
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:09,780
that anyway the the the challenge with

1044
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,820
redundancy right is that if people tend

1045
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,710
to use it right and you fail over but

1046
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,080
the problem is then what happens when

1047
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,690
you fail again and then you can't fail

1048
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:22,370
back over right so reconstitution and

1049
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:22,370
things like that are important right so

1050
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,330
right right at some point you're running

1051
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,530
out right and there are state size

1052
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,120
weight and power concerns and things

1053
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,280
like that you can't make this thing a

1054
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,930
bus right so in terms of the amount of

1055
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,240
stuff that you drop on it so obviously

1056
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,710
you what you need is you could say you

1057
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,120
have tools and things like that my

1058
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,680
approach probably wouldn't be this but

1059
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,509
I'll tell you what I would probably

1060
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,640
think you'd want to do but you could

1061
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,050
probably have like things like tools and

1062
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,100
things like that to do analysis that

1063
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,750
obviously would have to take this

1064
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,200
information and make it actionable

1065
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,640
to to to do reconstitution I think if

1066
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,870
you have laymen and things like that

1067
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,129
you're probably going to break things

1068
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,140
more than you're gonna fix things and

1069
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,160
you don't need people trying to think

1070
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,819
too deeply when they're in those

1071
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,200
environments so in in most or as little

1072
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,170
as possible right there's enough to

1073
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,879
worry about as it is so I would probably

1074
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:13,320
take the approach as some level of

1075
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,870
redundancy probably more than one

1076
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,460
depending on where you got for for size

1077
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:20,180
weight power and your requirements and

1078
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,440
so on and then reconstitution would be a

1079
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,629
start-over type of approach and the tool

1080
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,010
the the tools that I would probably say

1081
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,010
you'd want are the kind of tools that

1082
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,380
kind of rebuild you from a known state

1083
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:33,150
versus trying to analyze and figure out

1084
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,160
and things like that if you assume that

1085
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,930
the environment is one where you're not

1086
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,190
actively being attacked because you say

1087
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,710
well you're too far away and things like

1088
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:43,230
that if that's the if that's the threat

1089
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:44,460
model you're working with you know one

1090
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,020
of the challenges might be that if

1091
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,160
you're running into things that if you

1092
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,360
don't have an inherent problem which

1093
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,589
you've developed then you might have a

1094
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,300
supply chain problem which could be

1095
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,860
which could be something you can't

1096
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,240
really subvert after at that point you

1097
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,500
might just be in bad shape you're just

1098
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:00,720
trying to keep it limping along until

1099
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:03,030
you get somewhere but again thank you

1100
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,120
all for for presenting today it's very

1101
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,040
interesting

1102
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,770
thousands of years ago I worked on the

1103
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,230
city and what we were worried about it

1104
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,820
was being spoofed on earth you know like

1105
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,650
you know crop-dusting I mean that crop

1106
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,300
duster circles in the fields and the

1107
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,190
electronic equivalent of that is

1108
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,660
somebody spoofing us and making us think

1109
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:23,140
we were getting readings that weren't

1110
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,819
really coming from up there but having

1111
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,290
said that I would urge you also to think

1112
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,710
about I haven't heard people talk about

1113
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:31,360
software and I don't I don't see any

1114
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:33,820
breathtaking breakthroughs in software

1115
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,020
yet these days and you know formal

1116
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,880
methods they'll kill you if you try to

1117
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,800
do it for something unless it's the

1118
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,530
absolute smallest most critical code you

1119
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,480
have and so I I would urge you also to

1120
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,400
think about folks from the reliability

1121
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,300
world and what they're saying in this in

1122
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,640
this venue as well and the other ideas

1123
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,020
about supporting autonomy of the

1124
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,950
individuals of space it's a lot similar

1125
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:59,140
to medicine and supporting a physician

1126
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:00,819
with information about how to make you

1127
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,410
know they typically have just a set of

1128
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:06,100
symptoms but they need a lot more

1129
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,839
support for more complex decisions and

1130
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,759
so I really think the idea of supporting

1131
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,250
the autonomy of those individuals there

1132
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,250
with AI and other kinds of things is

1133
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,980
really crucial but my main point was

1134
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,900
about the software I'm you know NASA has

1135
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:24,040
done tremendous work in the area in this

1136
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:28,510
area but it's still a tremendous amount

1137
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:31,180
of code that's unbearable on unknown and

1138
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:33,070
you really have a Black Swan issue and

1139
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,690
all that and rat's nest of software

1140
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,740
that's been written decades ago and is

1141
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,740
still functioning out there

1142
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:52,200
well like it's yeah I mean it again I'd

1143
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,720
your point about legacy code is a good

1144
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,618
one I mean it's very expensive to you

1145
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,930
know for that matter more expensive to

1146
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,390
revamp the code and then frequently the

1147
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:05,759
hardware so typically it's not touched

1148
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:09,420
and and again it kind of boils down to

1149
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,130
budgetary constraints as far as again in

1150
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,730
the ideal world if you had infinite

1151
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:16,770
resources you would try and address all

1152
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,290
the possible scenarios but again even

1153
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,270
for folks that we work with I mean they

1154
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:23,700
always say well we'd like to kind of

1155
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,869
know what your ROI is in terms of again

1156
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,419
if you're dealing with a trusted system

1157
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:30,900
what should we look at across the board

1158
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:34,320
on our system that gives us the best you

1159
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,900
know reassurance or resiliency given the

1160
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,550
insertion costs because you know at the

1161
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,070
end of the day I mean there's a number

1162
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,140
of different circumstances where

1163
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,510
including the trusted foundry right I

1164
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,670
mean where there was a mandate that all

1165
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,830
government defense electronics go

1166
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:54,089
through that and it was yeah exactly

1167
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:56,279
it's it's exuberant in terms of the the

1168
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:58,520
ability for folks to adopt that because

1169
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,839
Asics are very expensive BGA's or

1170
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:04,140
essentially what everybody prefers to

1171
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:07,230
use right and in that environment they

1172
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:10,560
they deal with you know rat hard you

1173
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:12,690
know platforms or triple mode redundancy

1174
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,549
platforms to afford more of this

1175
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,690
reliability again because you know at

1176
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,790
the other day you're dealing with harsh

1177
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,800
radiation environments you're looking at

1178
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:22,259
things that you can put into your system

1179
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,960
that inherently provides more resiliency

1180
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,510
against failure but but again you know

1181
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,070
still even in that circumstance you

1182
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:31,290
could deal with a component issue where

1183
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:35,820
there's just the latent issue with

1184
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:40,410
capacitors so one other thing that I

1185
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:42,660
would point out and if I think about my

1186
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:45,480
experience working with NASA they spend

1187
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,399
a lot of time on flight rules and flight

1188
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,170
rule change

1189
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,980
one of the big problems with software

1190
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:57,300
that I I remember my mic coding days and

1191
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:59,340
don't want to go back but what is it

1192
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:02,850
that coders really don't like to do

1193
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:07,050
document what is it that coders really

1194
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:11,250
need to do document what do case tools

1195
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:14,030
need to do even better is document and

1196
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:17,670
version manage and self-updating

1197
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:21,180
archives of here's the config we're in

1198
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:24,450
now and here's how we got there and what

1199
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:28,879
is the human interpretable documentation

1200
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:32,609
and interpretation of our software and

1201
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,850
to the extent that that documentation is

1202
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:38,790
not available it becomes increasingly

1203
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:41,040
difficult to even do state

1204
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:43,410
identification so we've got to be able

1205
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,900
to identify it we've got to be able to

1206
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:47,850
archive it we've got to have human

1207
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,750
interpretable libraries of where we are

1208
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:54,000
right now I apologize if you talked

1209
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,760
about this but you considered defenses

1210
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,470
against the Independence Day attack that

1211
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,780
notion that they're gonna insert some

1212
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:03,089
alien is gonna insert JavaScript in your

1213
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,520
platform it caused the problems right

1214
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:07,830
but so that's kind of open e's are do

1215
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,730
you guys have a sense of how you could

1216
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:13,980
restrict software engineering for space

1217
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:16,370
platforms such as a simple rule like no

1218
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:20,550
interpreted languages has to be compiled

1219
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:24,150
so I cannot imagine that NASA could

1220
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:25,890
actually say you can't do this because

1221
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,800
it's so complicated so many different

1222
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,670
groups so many different software

1223
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,220
projects that have to come together to

1224
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:35,520
make a platform work do you can have the

1225
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,410
ability to restrict languages coding

1226
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,870
techniques methodologies and things like

1227
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:42,080
that or is that something that we all

1228
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,080
dream

1229
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,390
oh there's lots of issues to think about

1230
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,470
consider right so so but you guys are in

1231
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:58,440
a position where you have an overarching

1232
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,439
mission that has some really great

1233
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,410
justifications for restrictions okay

1234
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:08,530
it's hard to say that in many say in

1235
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:10,180
f-35 type platforms you can say I'm only

1236
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,620
gonna have this language in this

1237
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,609
platform because I only have these

1238
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:18,100
processors and these architectures but

1239
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:20,080
you guys have a very hybrid architecture

1240
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,339
in space especially in a sense on Mars

1241
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,990
you can end up with lots of different

1242
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,520
platforms lots of different modules lots

1243
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:28,350
of different languages lots of different

1244
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:30,940
things but could you guys come up with a

1245
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:32,350
method to restrict the software

1246
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,450
engineering techniques are being used

1247
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:37,150
say from a security perspective no

1248
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:40,210
interpreted languages is that feasible

1249
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:43,900
or is that just beyond the capability

1250
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:45,220
for the government to do it is that a

1251
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,230
reasonable question you guys are all

1252
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:48,879
kind of looking at each other I just

1253
00:57:47,230 --> 00:58:01,330
wonder if I'm asking there any question

1254
00:57:48,880 --> 00:58:04,510
yeah that's right yeah

1255
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,610
harsh kind of radiation requirement that

1256
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:09,640
that puts requirements on okay well what

1257
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:11,620
kind of hardware do you actually fly and

1258
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,720
connect so why there in that sense you

1259
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,730
also have software requirements one of

1260
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,450
the strictest requirements is kind of

1261
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:22,120
computation power and speed and many of

1262
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:24,160
the speed come requirements need you to

1263
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,920
the interpreted languages as they are

1264
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,819
just faster in that sense so I don't

1265
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,500
think it's impossible to make a mission

1266
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,150
requirement there I don't think we can't

1267
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,430
have control about the commercial

1268
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:38,260
missions that's difficult because I was

1269
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,180
going to say frequently will will carry

1270
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:43,690
government payloads and commercial

1271
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:47,100
systems and despite our box being secure

1272
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:50,800
in all efforts I mean if the you know

1273
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,440
rocket blows up you know again you're

1274
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,990
only as strong as your weakest link so

1275
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,580
the issue is there's multiple players in

1276
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,700
the whole space business right payload

1277
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,430
providers to the

1278
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:04,970
carrier and not everybody necessarily

1279
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:07,040
has the same requirements so there's

1280
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:11,589
kind of a black box I mean unless it's

1281
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:14,660
again it's a critical system that the

1282
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:16,250
customer requires requirements across

1283
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,020
the board that's likely but but again I

1284
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,100
think getting everybody on board and

1285
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:23,180
again dealing as we talked about

1286
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:27,650
cost-effective launches those are

1287
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:28,879
challenges yeah I've been mean I think

1288
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,930
you probably know this too actually

1289
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,630
I'm talking earlier that there's

1290
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,620
contracts obviously for different

1291
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:35,690
different government contractor they'll

1292
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:38,060
dictate the the languages that you can

1293
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,380
and can't you use for sure but doing it

1294
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,730
more from I think you're saying more

1295
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:45,500
from a higher higher policy type of

1296
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:47,510
approach in terms of everyone having to

1297
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,890
do that and maybe trying to I guess in

1298
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:51,050
my mind I'm trying to think what that

1299
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,520
would look like and maybe coming up with

1300
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,840
categories of different types of

1301
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,640
software and then limiting those

1302
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,080
different types of software possibly at

1303
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,180
certain particular languages especially

1304
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,620
the kind of length the kind of

1305
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,440
functionalities that are required for

1306
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,779
security critical type of things and

1307
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,320
stuff like that I would I would expect

1308
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:12,410
that that would be doable for sure in my

1309
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,450
mind but again it would go back to those

1310
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:17,000
first two steps of understanding what is

1311
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:18,680
your strategy and so on and so forth and

1312
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,030
really defining what is it what is it

1313
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,850
you're saying you're accomplishing by

1314
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:24,260
that right because if you don't say what

1315
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,940
it is you're trying to accomplish with

1316
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,320
it and so on and so forth it's hard to

1317
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,140
tell what's good but but it can be

1318
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:33,110
simple things like only ipv6 on the

1319
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,819
platform so no ipv4 from the internet

1320
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:36,140
could ever get onto the platform you

1321
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,470
know that those kinds of restrictions

1322
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:41,450
actually you're very protected and very

1323
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:44,029
architectural restrictive which gives

1324
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:47,319
you some control right no Windows

1325
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:52,670
software on the platform no windows 98

1326
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:54,890
you can't get rid of that right it's

1327
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:57,500
easier to restrict old stuff off but

1328
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:59,089
dictating new stuff and that ends up

1329
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,740
being old stuff is the problem well a

1330
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:02,000
long time ago was thought that ATM was

1331
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,350
gonna solve a lot of these problems cuz

1332
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,570
it ATM was the only thing running on

1333
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:09,380
these devices nobody keyed in right cuz

1334
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:11,780
there's no bridge but so these ideas of

1335
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:12,500
building real protective platforms that

1336
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,210
are income

1337
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,300
Hannibal with external infrastructure

1338
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:19,370
did can't use any of the same binaries

1339
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,910
they're in the same interpret language

1340
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:24,319
types work you know but but they're

1341
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:28,310
difficult because it cost more money in

1342
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:30,710
all I'll just interesting here one of

1343
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:33,020
the big problems though is the testing

1344
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:36,350
and advanced development you need to

1345
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:40,040
develop will always put you in a watch

1346
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:42,950
state that is several years behind what

1347
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,960
is going to be state of the art and so

1348
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:49,189
you're always going to have a

1349
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:51,890
heterogenous architecture and the

1350
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:54,320
watched architecture may be the oldest

1351
01:01:51,890 --> 01:02:00,020
one there so it's kind of hard to say

1352
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:07,520
keep the rest of your platform in you

1353
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:09,800
know the relative Stone Age my

1354
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,170
experience with government regulations

1355
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:15,170
on kind of technology is as it has to go

1356
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:16,610
through the process it's kind of when it

1357
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:19,700
comes into effect it's kind of outdated

1358
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:21,410
at that point so I would rather argue

1359
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,450
against it because I think it in many

1360
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:33,790
cases the intention is good but it's

1361
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:36,020
actually holding us back sure quick

1362
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:38,360
philosophical question how are you going

1363
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:40,340
to manage the conflict between the

1364
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,310
architectural perspective of engineers

1365
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:45,830
and programmers let me illustrate that

1366
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,660
after a series of satellite failures in

1367
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:51,410
2002 the GAO published a report

1368
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:55,310
indicating two classes of threats to

1369
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:57,620
satellites class one were unintentional

1370
01:02:55,310 --> 01:03:00,410
acts which included solar wind

1371
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,509
meteorites in class two were intentional

1372
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:05,470
acts like somebody trying to knock down

1373
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:09,050
a transmission tower what they ignored

1374
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:12,980
were bad software architectural

1375
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:14,930
decisions and poor coding practices both

1376
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,660
of which have caused problems with

1377
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:19,220
satellites system Socrates said two

1378
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:23,569
satellites we're gonna pass within five

1379
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:25,629
hundred sixty four meters the actual

1380
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:28,060
value was zero

1381
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:30,119
the collision 2009 created 2,000 pieces

1382
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,740
of debris when you hear a number like

1383
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:35,290
564 you would think there's a precision

1384
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:39,790
of plus or minus half a meter they were

1385
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:41,619
off by 564 the architectural decision

1386
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:44,050
I'm thinking of is that 10-bit week

1387
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:46,900
counter which rolled over on Saturday

1388
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:49,930
and it turns out that some 777s actually

1389
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,400
had some problems with the date as a

1390
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,890
result of that rollover that's an

1391
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,380
architectural thing these are neither

1392
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:58,390
intentional or unintentional threats and

1393
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:00,730
I'm thinking that the did people who did

1394
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:04,270
the GA report came from an engineering

1395
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:06,100
mindset not a programming mindset and I

1396
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:08,230
believe that would seriously jeopardize

1397
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:15,130
any long-term space mission I'd like

1398
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:28,510
your thoughts hardware software

1399
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:30,430
vulnerabilities vulnerability yeah I

1400
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,080
mean trust a supply chain right I mean

1401
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,118
that's a given for any type of

1402
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,980
government furnished equipment you

1403
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:37,600
always worry about that and it's part of

1404
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,619
the reason why there are captive fabs

1405
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:45,180
because again with offshore suppliers

1406
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:47,320
you aren't certain about the pedigree so

1407
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:52,149
yeah I know within our industry there's

1408
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:53,770
definitely things in place to obviously

1409
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,270
not just verification but software

1410
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:57,790
assurance and things like that a lot of

1411
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,990
things that were that that are worked to

1412
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,990
try to deal with those kind of things

1413
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:03,700
and it's kind of neat that now even

1414
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,830
though I'm pretty young guy as far as

1415
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,569
I'm concerned you know they didn't have

1416
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:09,160
cyber security I tell my kids that sound

1417
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,540
like an old guy but cyber security and

1418
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,160
all these things weren't a thing or they

1419
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,330
you know Software Assurance wasn't even

1420
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,069
a thing but you know all the

1421
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:17,380
universities have it now right and

1422
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:19,450
hopefully it only grows right so most of

1423
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,890
the people writing the code still didn't

1424
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,839
grow up with any of that stuff either so

1425
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,549
in my mind I'm hoping that you know

1426
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,200
through schools through the colleges

1427
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,960
like Purdue and so on that this kind of

1428
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,270
the practices that lend themselves to

1429
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,400
avoiding those kind of things will be

1430
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,509
will improve I mean you have to admit

1431
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,160
it's pretty amazing that they got it

1432
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,620
exactly to zero though I mean that's

1433
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,420
pretty

1434
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:42,609
it's pretty impressive you couldn't do

1435
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:51,070
that twice absolutely

1436
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:51,070
[Applause]

1437
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,340
you
