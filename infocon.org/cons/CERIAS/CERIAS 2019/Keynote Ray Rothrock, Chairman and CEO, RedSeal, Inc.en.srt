again for this 21st edition of the

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,548
serious cyber security conference really

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,850
it's a pleasure and an honor to have you

30
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,619
all here we're really thankful not only

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,449
for your participation today but really

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,600
for your engagement with Sirius and the

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,430
university over the years the industrial

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,649
consortium and the collaborations and

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,710
partnerships that you all helped us

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,970
build so that our work our ideas our

37
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,880
education activities for our future

38
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,979
graduates all have the highest and best

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,829
possible impact on society in general

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,810
and really on national security and the

41
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,199
field in particular of cyber security I

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,810
think as you probably know by now having

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,380
I suppose many of you have been being

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,530
here before Purdue is a university that

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,899
is very very strongly dedicated to the

46
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,850
national security mission

47
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,310
everybody from president mitch daniels

48
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,490
down believes as strongly and

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,200
particularly he does I can tell you that

50
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,280
from a first-person account he believes

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,290
very strongly that national security

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,959
defense is part of our land-grant

53
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,540
mission

54
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,299
that we as a land-grant University are

55
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,578
dedicated to service education research

56
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,650
and engagement in the public interest

57
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,950
and are a big part of that is our

58
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,590
dedication to advancing ideas new

59
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,319
knowledge technologies partnerships that

60
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,090
will help impact in a positive way the

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,798
national security posture of the country

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,620
and what event could be more timely more

63
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:44,139
important and this event here today when

64
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,780
it comes to the future of national

65
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:48,900
security we live in an era in which I

66
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,780
think we're moving from the traditional

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,650
thoughts about cybersecurity and

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,069
securing our computer networks and

69
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,799
trying to prevent intrusion to an era in

70
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,839
which we are surrounded by exponentially

71
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,810
growing technologies which are having a

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,780
deeper impact on society than I think we

73
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,000
even understand today the development of

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,299
everything from artificial intelligence

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,250
to machine learning to robotics to all

76
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,079
kinds of digital technologies that are

77
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,430
impacting the Internet of Things and

78
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:26,889
application of sensors and data all over

79
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,590
our lives is having a huge positive

80
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,269
impact on society I mean we're seeing

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,000
already we have groups here on campus

82
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,530
that are working on how to apply machine

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,379
learning artificial intelligence

84
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,139
techniques together with tens of

85
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:46,209
millions on healthcare private health

86
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:48,009
care data on trying to improve both

87
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,949
diagnostics and therapeutics in the

88
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,388
healthcare sector for example what could

89
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,459
be more important what could be better

90
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,129
what could be more impactful to society

91
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,169
than ever stand like that but on the

92
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:01,000
other hand you know of course and that's

93
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,430
why you're all here there is the other

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,019
side there is the threat of loss of

95
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,049
privacy there's the threat of loss of

96
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,579
data there is a safe of in the threat of

97
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:14,650
intrusion that good lead to bad outcomes

98
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,440
that will affect society in negative

99
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,918
ways so you know we are thrilled at

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,190
Discovery Park to host serious this

101
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,560
happened about 2 years ago as Joel said

102
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,389
Discovery Park is dedicated to

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,060
incentivizing and promoting an ecosystem

104
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,970
in which science technology engineering

105
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,460
and research happen in a completely

106
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,379
transdisciplinary way tearing down all

107
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,400
kinds of traditional academic boundaries

108
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:46,190
and syria's exemplifies that vision

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,500
because you know the the faculty the

110
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,319
students that work within syria's are

111
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,990
truly dedicated to advancing security

112
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:57,169
information security and cyber physical

113
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,030
security across all applications in

114
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,280
society not just for the sake of

115
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,130
computer science although that is

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,840
important to advancing the fundamentals

117
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,909
of information theory and computer

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,818
science in this space but also the

119
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:14,479
application of these methods to all

120
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,979
kinds of societal issues with high

121
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,000
impact as the one I was mentioning in

122
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:22,880
healthcare so I certainly hope that you

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,050
will have an absolutely fantastic event

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,050
I know that agenda looks phenomenal and

125
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,969
really on behalf of Purdue University

126
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,130
and Discovery Park again thank you so

127

sexually working okay

132
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,440
I couldn't hear it so I wanted to make

133
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,030
sure before we got too far into the

134
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,759
program today that everyone could hear

135
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,619
and welcome I'd like to welcome you

136
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,470
personally myself I'm David Ebert and

137
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,509
I'm the interim director of serious

138
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,690
following a long tradition of excellent

139
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,360
lead here for serious and it's my

140
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,860
pleasure this morning to introduce our

141
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,129
keynote speaker Ray rostock who is with

142
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,370
Red Seal and it's a enterprise

143
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:25,039
cybersecurity company that is based in

144
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,370
California and besides his excellent

145
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,310
work in cybersecurity he's also part of

146
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,949
a band called up into the right so if

147
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,250
you're in the Bay Area go and check them

148
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,830
out

149
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,020
and I always amazed at people who have

150
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,849
enough time to be involved in so many

151
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,799
different things showing all their

152
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,599
different aspects of creativity and

153
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,520
he'll be talking about digital

154
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,349
resilience as your company ready for the

155
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,539
next cyber threat here I'll also be

156
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:53,539
signing his book tonight during our

157
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,110
poster session and with that let's

158
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,110
welcome ray

159
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:15,030
okay so working ah terrific

160
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:18,479
good morning great boy I'm gonna put

161
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:22,559
this out here well good morning everyone

162
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,270
it's a pleasure to be here I I would say

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,849
this weather is because I come from

164
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,469
California but I know better it's been

165
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,280
it's been a pretty tough tough winter

166
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:35,099
out there so this is one of my favorite

167
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,388
topics and I really just spend a few

168
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,360
minutes this morning taking us through

169
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:42,389
some of my learnings as a venture

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,949
capitalist I was a VC for 25 years with

171
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,449
the Rockefeller family out of New York

172
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:50,039
City where I discovered cybersecurity if

173
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,630
you will before that it's Sun

174
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,550
Microsystems and before that I was a

175
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,830
nuclear engineer so the concept of

176
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,389
thinking thank you being uh thinking

177
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,419
ahead and be protective is a really good

178
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,690
idea one of the things I've I've learned

179
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,039
I've been very lucky of the board of MIT

180
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,949
and some other places you meet a lot of

181
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,909
interesting people and one of the in

182
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,680
public boards have been on eight public

183
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,449
boards one of the things that really

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,219
comes through is that communication uh

185
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,550
vocabulary is really really important

186
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:20,039
and unfortunately cyber is full of

187
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,680
technical gobbledygook I mean I'm pretty

188
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,719
technical I still believe it or not

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,039
program routers and firewalls and a few

190
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:29,880
things like that I wouldn't admit that

191
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,889
except to a crowd like this but there's

192
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,229
just a whole conversation that's missing

193
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,079
so I wrote this book digital resilience

194
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,820
it came out last year last summer to

195
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:43,529
begin to try to explain what this world

196
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,079
were living in and put into English

197
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,720
words and communication that people can

198
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,149
understand so in the course of all my

199
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,490
time as a VC and doing cyber tools I did

200
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,339
I did 15 cyber deals while I was at

201
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,660
viñarock so I've been very active and

202
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,279
now I'm the CEO of one of our

203
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,920
investments Red Seal

204
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,990
I met Dick Clark dick dick and I've met

205
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,709
along been working a long time on some

206
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,060
ideas and he very much encouraged me to

207
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,859
write this book so I want to thank dick

208
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,530
for that because the concept of

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,620
resilience though it's a word we all use

210
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,670
how's it work how does it apply here

211
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,470
really matters as a venture capitalist

212
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,500
one of the I think one of the hallmarks

213
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,940
of being a good VC is good pattern

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,920
recognition I'm sure buddy knows what I

215
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,780
mean by that good engineers have pattern

216
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,219
recognition entrepreneurs have good

217
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,430
pattern recognition but VC's have good

218
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,870
pattern recognition and and so I take a

219
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,969
lot of those learnings and I pack it

220
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,630
into this book to try to bring real

221
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,880
world experiences through the patterns

222
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,050
into the cyber world and that's like I'm

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,450
probably preaching a little bit to the

224
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,339
choir about some of that so always like

225
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,720
let's see which way it goes next okay so

226
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,900
how many people think we're winning this

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,460
thing called a cyber war show of hands

228
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,310
yeah how many think a lot of heads going

229
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,410
left back and forth yeah it's a it's

230
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,760
pretty tough pretty tough times it's

231
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,650
probably not gonna get better before

232
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,800
it's not going to get better before it

233
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,240
gets more worse I think I think we do

234
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,310
have an issue and we really got either

235
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,430
at it you know the the history would

236
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,680
suggest and I've been investing since in

237
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,270
the early 80s in in the world but

238
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,760
history would suggest we're not winning

239
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,430
so back in the day there was antivirus

240
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,900
and virus stuff and it was passed around

241
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,359
on floppy disk if you remember what

242
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,949
those things were and it was a problem

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,750
but we kind of solved that this is about

244
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,170
an eight billion dollar problem in terms

245
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,780
of the software sales today and then we

246
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,040
had networks networks were starting to

247
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,449
hook things together the internet

248
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,900
happened you know Tim berners-lee

249
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,220
invented HTML and suddenly it wasn't it

250
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,959
was no more just the domain of

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,480
scientists sharing information it was

252
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,270
suddenly Amazon appeared in Yahoo and

253
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,160
the world was just connecting up like

254
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,900
crazy without much regard and then we

255
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,060
had firewalls and militaries had those

256
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,579
things for a long time but those sort of

257
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,859
burst on the scene in the early 90s I

258
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,810
did this deal called checkpoint software

259
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,910
out of Tel Aviv Israel all I'll never

260
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,910
forget when I came back to my partners

261
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,500
and in New York I was the youngster in

262
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,780
the group they were all gray hair like I

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,980
am now but I said guys we need to get in

264
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,480
the internet business and we need to

265
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,680
make some investments fast and the first

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,170
one I think I'd like to make is

267
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,878
insecurity and they said okay go out and

268
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,498
figure that out so I came back and

269
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,449
I say they'll say I got some great news

270
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:32,669
I said there are lots of firewall

271
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:34,498
companies and they said well what could

272
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:38,039
be the bad news I said the best one I

273
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:39,600
think is located in Israel and this is

274
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,029
the Rockefeller family and even though

275
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,649
they're an international group the idea

276
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,049
of wiring ten million dollars out of the

277
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,779
United States to this five person

278
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,519
company in Tel Aviv was hard to sell but

279
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,959
we did it and of course checkpoint

280
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,629
turned out to be a huge success but it

281
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,118
it gave me an insight into what was

282
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:59,369
coming right so there was intrusion

283
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:02,279
detection came along I did a company

284
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:05,309
called Imperva PGP software and a bunch

285
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,379
of others along the way each time kind

286
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,988
of addressing the problem of the day

287
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,379
whether it was a a gateway with a

288
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:15,089
firewall whether it was some bad

289
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,069
behavior on a network through intrusion

290
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,699
detection my deal there was called

291
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,709
haystack labs or whether it was database

292
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,449
protection you know fending off SQL

293
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,219
attacks and stuff just whatever it was

294
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:28,410
it was a an event

295
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,269
I call it whack-a-mole where there was a

296
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,059
mole sticks his head up and and suddenly

297
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,799
entrepreneurs just went back and the VCS

298
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:38,249
were writing checks faster than we could

299
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,429
kind of cash them and so it was a big

300
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:44,069
deal a big deal and then we had zero day

301
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,829
stuff next-generation firewall came out

302
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:51,299
we moved out of the stack the OSI layer

303
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:55,368
three for up to seven far I which was on

304
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:57,509
its absolute last breath last breath

305
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:59,669
when this whole thing happened just

306
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,139
exploded went public and of course the

307
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,549
rest is history and we all add and that

308
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,799
became the word of the day in the

309
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,970
boardrooms of America so but history

310
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,429
would suggest that we're losing these

311
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,049
each of these is kind of a proxy for how

312
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,509
the threats have grown how the business

313
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:14,549
has grown today the cyber software

314
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,739
business is about a 25 30 billion

315
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:17,728
services are about twice that so all in

316
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:22,439
it's about a hundred hundred and ten

317
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:24,569
billion so but yet no one has really

318
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:27,299
come up with a silver bullet to deal

319
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,858
with all this in fact I think a real

320
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,858
tipping point for me I retired from

321
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:34,649
viñarock in 2013 but that very December

322
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:35,879
was when target was revealed to have

323
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,429
this big problem everybody knows that

324
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,710
the target attack is right yeah

325
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,890
pretty serious here's a fortune

326
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,600
company with technology that I had built

327
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,000
through my investments and they had

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,580
purchased they had engineers they had

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,710
capital they had technology yet they

330
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,480
were hammered and and was an

331
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,580
embarrassment to the whole world forty

332
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,450
million customer records went out the

333
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:03,900
door it was a massive problem and the

334
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:07,650
pattern recognition moment I had a lard

335
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:12,600
from Minh Rock was WOW the bad stuff is

336
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:16,610
inside it's already there this notion of

337
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,980
putting up a firewall so a perimeter is

338
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,530
like old news you got to have it but

339
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,480
it's all new so what's inside so you

340
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,579
know and then of course recently we've

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,390
got Russia and China and North Korea at

342
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,850
the Sony attack

343
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,260
we have nation-states involving we're

344
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,250
probably doing some of this bad stuff

345
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,930
too but it's it's why it's a wide open

346
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,370
thing so this this threat is real and

347
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,260
you all nobody raised their hand when I

348
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,260
asked the question are we in a war or

349
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,650
are we winning the war and so there you

350
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,600
go

351
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,300
so then I asked myself so how'd the bad

352
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,830
guys get in well they get inside because

353
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,140
of phishing it might knows what phishing

354
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,560
is right 99% of the successful X

355
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,210
filtrations come from phishing so the

356
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,829
technology works pretty well we've got

357
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,120
good processes and stuff but at the end

358
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,250
of the day you and me are gonna

359
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,830
accidentally or on purpose click on

360
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,830
something we shouldn't divulge some

361
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,470
information we shouldn't and release the

362
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,030
problem so if we're gonna release the

363
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,070
problem it's a little bit like this

364
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,510
building this building's got sprinkler

365
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,890
systems right why do they put a

366
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,830
sprinkler system in here does anybody

367
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,850
expect this building to catch on fire

368
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,750
now of course not but there's a

369
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,150
sprinkler system

370
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,650
I didn't see an elevator but if you

371
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,030
written an elevator up did you go by the

372
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,120
office to check that the elevator had

373
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,920
been inspected no did you believe that

374
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,060
the building is gonna stand while we sit

375
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,579
here and have this kind of course you

376
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,400
did those concepts don't exist here and

377
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,080
the fishing is just a piece of it this

378
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,670
starts so what is this costing us is

379
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,220
costing those trillions of dollars

380
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,579
this is Forbes in 2016 I haven't seen an

381
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,040
update recently tried to find one but

382
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,810
its massive does anybody know what the

383
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,430
research budget of the entire United

384
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,140
States private and public sector

385
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,709
is what that number is so you might know

386
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,199
what that number is yes it's it's 500

387
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,540
billion and the government spends only a

388
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,030
hundred billion so 400 billion private

389
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,480
so this number exceeds three or four

390
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,760
times what we spend in research and this

391
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,870
money finds its way to the bad guys

392
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,610
somehow and so the the fear I have being

393
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,170
an investor in innovation and in the

394
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,640
quality of life we all have iPhones or

395
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,319
something like that I mean you know

396
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,900
technology has really transformed our

397
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,520
way of living every time we have to

398
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,910
invent a new piece of cybersecurity

399
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,699
software it takes away from those other

400
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,500
productive uses of R&D money so these

401
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,090
guys are winning and it's a real problem

402
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,640
but moreover I think it's about trust

403
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,770
you know when Target happened there

404
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,580
their stock dipped a little bit a lot of

405
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,319
people probably stopped shopping there

406
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,160
and it came right back and then we had

407
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,050
Sony and then we had Equifax and you

408
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,410
know now I actually just the other day I

409
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,719
needed to reopen I locked all my credit

410
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,270
card company stuff down and I needed to

411
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,490
open it up for something and I couldn't

412
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,290
do it they have they have made them they

413
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,770
have they have been interrupted their

414
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,599
business with such a high friction entry

415
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,270
point to open it up to let someone get

416
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,010
that information is so it's like I don't

417
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,379
like these people they have no right for

418
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,140
my data but there they are and so you

419
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,280
know how do we these poor folks you know

420
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,910
Wells Fargo Equifax and that this is an

421
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,460
interesting one right the Facebook guys

422
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,990
boy yesterday said I think it was

423
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,290
yesterday or last week's testimony

424
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,690
so look organizations still fail fail

425
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,980
the basic cyber hygiene test we don't

426
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,440
even train people I was at an insurance

427
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,030
company in Chicago last year giving a

428
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,850
talk to a bunch of underwriters just a

429
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,080
general talk about cybersecurity and and

430
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,550
I said you know how many people take

431
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,649
phishing tests and they have you know we

432
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,180
use it at my company everybody has

433
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,060
everybody done a phishing test online

434
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,380
all that right yeah so you know just

435
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,879
like you most everybody raised their

436
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,670
hand and I said how many people have

437
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,990
taken two and about half the people

438
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,490
ultimately at the end of the day I said

439
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,490
what happens if you fail three times

440
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,340
if you're in a company and you're

441
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,949
handling personal information and you

442
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,780
can't quite grok the notion of phishing

443
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,400
and how to deal with it if you fell

444
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,060
three times what does it company do

445
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,730
about you

446
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,710
need a policy to deal with that but more

447
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,140
importantly what the CEO fails three

448
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,360
times what if a board member field what

449
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,940
if the CFO fails three times what do you

450
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,189
do these are these are hard things to

451
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,680
contemplate companies and compliance and

452
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,540
governance is just it's just now

453
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,420
starting to trickle in and that's what

454
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,580
I've been trying to do with my book so

455
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,780
there's a great book put out a couple of

456
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,260
years ago I don't know if you've heard

457
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,210
of it

458
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,350
Judith Rodin you choose president

459
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,820
Rockefeller Foundation it's called the

460
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,379
resilience dividend this is a little bit

461
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,060
of an inspiration for me when I was

462
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,340
thinking about how to get the message

463
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,740
out about resilience in the cyber world

464
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,980
she talks about cities in the United

465
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:02,140
States this is a 2014 publication so in

466
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,330
2014 there were three cities in the

467
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,940
United States that had a chief

468
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,100
resilience officer three how many do you

469
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,650
think there are today they're about a

470
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,919
hundred and you can think about it for a

471
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,870
minute so New Orleans probably has a

472
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,940
chief resilience officer who worries

473
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,919
about the dikes in the water and all the

474
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,050
things the levees and all that's going

475
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,790
on there San Francisco what do you worry

476
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,820
about you worry about earthquakes

477
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,760
what about Boston this is an interesting

478
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,860
one and we're about civil unrest that's

479
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,720
what the cro in boston worries about so

480
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,399
it should cut all the big cities in the

481
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,530
country now have them there may even be

482
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
a chief resilience officer here in

483
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,670
lafayette i don't know i that flew in i

484
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,980
looked down and saw the rivers out in

485
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,680
the farmland unbelievable picture i took

486
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,170
i just when you see it real I'm sure you

487
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,370
guys live it and know it it's really sad

488
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,990
but anyway this is a really good book it

489
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,570
talked a lot about she has case studies

490
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:59,340
and it really was an inspiring and

491
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:02,110
sparked inspiration for me so I often

492
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,990
get to the point of so you know what's a

493
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,719
good bottle for resist resilience and

494
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,520
the human body comes to mind and I

495
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,640
didn't think this up originally but if

496
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,520
you think about a network it has a

497
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,850
perimeter it has stuff that moves inside

498
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,710
on wires or maybe wirelessly you have

499
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:24,639
all these things

500
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,499
and just to give you some to personalize

501
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:28,059
to so your skin right your skin you have

502
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:30,039
eyes and mouth ears nose and other

503
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,879
things but your skin is that perimeter

504
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,340
protection and it stays pretty well you

505
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,269
know and you have an intended

506
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,668
penetration when you eat something or

507
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,200
when you hear something or otherwise but

508
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:43,570
what if you cut yourself now you have an

509
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,360
unintended penetration and then we have

510
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,428
systems in our bodies white blood cells

511
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,258
and immediately find out what that

512
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,919
penetration is and attack anything that

513
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,659
gets in

514
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,249
that's intrusion detection and then we

515
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:58,059
have red blood cells which actually do

516
00:20:54,249 --> 00:21:00,580
the repair we've actually human nature

517
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:04,450
has not human nature Nature has done a

518
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:08,529
great job with resilience and so my CTO

519
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,639
is actually a epidemiologist and he has

520
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,340
applied many of the things he's learned

521
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:13,600
from his professional life into the

522
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,369
networking world and it's the

523
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,699
inspiration for the company that I now

524
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:21,639
lead called Red Seal there we go

525
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,169
so I think at the end of the day after

526
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,139
having made all these investments and

527
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,480
all this technology and we're not

528
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:31,090
winning something has to change you know

529
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,230
that old axiom you if you do the same

530
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,749
thing and expect a different result

531
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,399
that's called insanity maybe Einstein

532
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,259
said that or somebody I know who gets

533
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:39,879
credit for it it's a good one and that's

534
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:41,619
where we are on the cyber world we have

535
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,269
to do things different we have to think

536
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,869
differently and the pattern to me

537
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:49,330
suggests we think like mother Nature has

538
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:52,899
done like these buildings have done like

539
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:55,689
our society has done we have to think

540
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:57,489
with resilience it's a big deal so but

541
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,340
resilience is not a product it's a

542
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,730
strategy it's a it's a it's a process

543
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:07,090
it's people and its technology twenty

544
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,769
five billion in technology last year VC

545
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,080
the venture capital world put in five

546
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,279
billion dollars of investment here and

547
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,559
we were just talking Jean and I were

548
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,119
just talking about RSA and the lack of

549
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,408
innovation it seems like we're sort of

550
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,559
going around the horn again but

551
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,299
technology is there processes are

552
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,678
important you got to have people got to

553
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,899
know what to do and how to do it because

554
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,179
people change jobs and things come and

555
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:31,359
go and then you have people processes

556
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:33,009
without people is a failure processes of

557
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,460
that technology and people are a failure

558
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:37,460
so you got to have all three

559
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,990
those things very very important so

560
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,880
technology most systems are not built

561
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,710
with resilience in mind the internet was

562
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
built originally right the DARPA net the

563
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,000
whole ability to get a message across

564
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,040
the country during a nuclear war well

565
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,660
that was good then but not so good now

566
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,100
but it wasn't built with resilience in

567
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,260
mind and it's really you know three main

568
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,419
things data network and infrastructure

569
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,730
my company Red Seal focuses here we

570
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,290
don't focus on the data piece because I

571
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,090
think the first thing about resilience

572
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,470
is understanding what the heck you have

573
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,360
what does it look like how does it

574
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,670
operate

575
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,770
that's jacks or better to even be in the

576
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,880
game and then once you understand what

577
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,080
you have and then how it's hooked

578
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,630
together then you can worry about the

579
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,030
data of course data is what the bad guys

580
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,380
are after so these four things

581
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:23,330
understanding invisibility

582
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,310
so we at Red Seal have over 250 large

583
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,750
customers from the federal government to

584
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:31,610
Fortune 500 companies and 100% of the

585
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,010
time when we run our software on

586
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,810
somebody's network we find things that

587
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,960
they didn't know existed or that we find

588
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:40,639
mistakes that they have we've just last

589
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,200
week we closed a deal with the Defense

590
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,760
Intelligence Agency these are smart

591
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,240
dudes man they know what they're doing

592
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,680
yeah not quite infinite budgets but they

593
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,440
can spend what they wanted to get done

594
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,380
what they want and we were there and my

595
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,490
federal chief technology officer was

596
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,450
just telling me this story yesterday

597
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,560
actually we were there and they said

598
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,910
well Kay we're gonna run the software on

599
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,290
your legacy network and they said no no

600
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,850
no we don't care what the legacy we

601
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,110
think we got that under control okay

602
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,530
what are you gonna go go to the cloud

603
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,659
brand new brand spanking new just stood

604
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,670
up they have this thing called a c2s

605
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,830
which is behind the firewalls and the

606
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,800
federal government so we ran our

607
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,350
software against the cloud and we were

608
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,430
still analyzing still understanding how

609
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,800
things are hooked together and they

610
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,140
screamed oh my god stop that is wrong

611
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,820
that piece of the network that Enclave

612
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,160
is wrong and it's connected to this

613
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,689
thing over here this is brand-new stuff

614
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,210
they just stood it up in the last year

615
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,420
so people make mistakes and great

616
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,270
intentions because smart people but if

617
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,680
you can't see it you can't manage it you

618
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,889
can't understand it this is where it all

619
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,600
starts the other thing measurement so in

620
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,540
all my years of investing in

621
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,060
cybersecurity

622
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,889
admittedly it was a niche business no

623
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,690
one ever showed up and said I'm going to

624
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,720
give you a product that tells you how

625
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,910
good you've done measurement was not

626
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,830
even part of the conversation I will

627
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,160
tell you folks the board only

628
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,010
understands one thing numbers and

629
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,170
measurement and trends so if you want to

630
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:12,090
talk about cyber up the chain in

631
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,550
corporate America or in our policy world

632
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,139
you got to talk about numbers so we've

633
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,790
built into our product at red still a

634
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,780
thing called the digital resilience core

635
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,909
we actually will give you a score we'll

636
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:29,730
give you it's just like FICO score FICO

637
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:31,590
goes from 350 to 807 25 FICO you can

638
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,830
probably go buy borrow money to buy a

639
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:37,590
house I mean if you're 375 well you

640
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,669
probably just lost your job but it's

641
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,899
about given a score to leadership to

642
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,340
know what to do next not only that but

643
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,200
then we give you reasons codes and we

644
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,240
give you recommendations on how to bring

645
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,400
it up or bring it down whatever you got

646
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,860
to do but measurement is really really

647
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,090
important so if you understand and you

648
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,889
can measure it then you can be in

649
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,040
compliance and compliance is not just

650
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,870
the public policy stuff like PC PCI and

651
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,290
all that but it's what your own policies

652
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,570
are target I mean they probably had a

653
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,790
policy that said the HVAC system should

654
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,710
not be talking to the point-of-sale

655
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,960
systems they probably had that policy

656
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,910
but they couldn't prove it and that's

657
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,630
where the understanding of visibility

658
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,490
matters they did in fact I'd the first

659
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,470
chapter of my book is I detailed quite a

660
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,810
lot about from a management point of

661
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,700
view what went wrong and interesting I

662
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,350
learned this I didn't know this at the

663
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,300
time it was happening but there they do

664
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,550
have a policy and a procedure in the

665
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,889
store that says that night they turn off

666
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:37,590
the cash registers after they

667
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,450
transferred the data out but it was a

668
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,949
Christmas season and somebody forgot to

669
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,240
turn off the cash registers and even

670
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,510
though the hard drives had been cleaned

671
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,090
of the PCI data the PCI data was in the

672
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:50,100
memory of the computer scanners so the

673
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,510
software the malware found it in the

674
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,889
memory and that's what started the

675
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,920
problem but they had a policy they had a

676
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,210
compliance but they couldn't prove it so

677
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,120
interesting there and then accelerate

678
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,779
response this is one people think people

679
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,279
think you have a cyber alarm bell go

680
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,919
off and oh well those take care of these

681
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,080
you know some bright cyber walk will get

682
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,820
online type a few things and it's

683
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,349
screening and all of a sudden the

684
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,239
problem-solving no could nothing could

685
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,668
be further than the truth it can take

686
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:18,399
months even years Sonia was 11 months in

687
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:20,259
the making on this one but the the

688
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,330
people so a lot or understand I said

689
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:24,429
okay you're at home your house catches

690
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,769
on fire you dial nine-one-one and you

691
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,049
run out the door two weeks later the

692
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,929
fire department shows up that's where

693
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:34,450
cyber response is your your plane your

694
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:38,049
your house just burn to the ground it's

695
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,149
a real problem so we call this the sort

696
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:42,399
of arc of getting resilient

697
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,839
understanding measuring managing and

698
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,549
then being able to respond because you

699
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,450
know where everything is and how to

700
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:47,979
respond to it

701
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,700
these are the building blocks are very

702
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:52,869
important so seven you know when we do

703
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,089
surveys and we do this every year

704
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:57,549
seventy six for this seventy six percent

705
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,259
of the CEOs believe that they have an

706
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,479
accurate print of their network they

707
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:04,089
probably do but it's you know a paper a

708
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:06,039
paper copy that was about three or four

709
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:11,379
years old and the network has changed

710
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:13,629
last hour yesterday last week as I said

711
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:15,939
a few minutes ago every time we run our

712
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:18,998
software we find new stuff every time

713
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,589
and it even if you've installed it every

714
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,719
time it runs again you're gonna find new

715
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:25,418
stuff because people change there's this

716
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:27,460
whole thing called shadow IT you

717
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,499
probably have heard the term so data

718
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,969
moves on a pathways the pathways are

719
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:33,879
programmed and the routing routing

720
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:36,849
tables and all that and understanding

721
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:40,119
all that is very hard to do our largest

722
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:45,460
customer the u.s. post office has 46,000

723
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:48,309
routers so can you imagine a problem

724
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,109
occurring and some technician at the

725
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,539
sock in Washington having to figure out

726
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:56,289
what's wrong with the routers but in in

727
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:57,999
Oregon for example it's a real pot so we

728
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,809
model that and we give them the tools to

729
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:03,729
see how it see how it goes it's not

730
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:05,168
trivial forty-six thousand apples one

731
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,779
hundred and ten thousand routers and

732
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,070
we're just scratching the surface there

733
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:11,200
so these are these networks have been

734
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,389
built over decades by smart people with

735
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,170
good intentions but they simply don't

736
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:16,610
have all the answers

737
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,970
here's the scoring I was talking about

738
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,439
our little our little FICO score concept

739
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,210
we look at all the vulnerabilities in

740
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,380
your network the configuration data to

741
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,299
make sure you've done it according to

742
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,970
the vendor and then we do this

743
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:33,080
calculation of pathways known and

744
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:35,660
unknown so one of the things that well

745
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,490
so all I gotta do is give our software

746
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,380
one credential and we'll figure out the

747
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,490
whole thing and by this isn't a

748
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,590
commercial I'm just sort of giving you

749
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,410
examples of how we've learned why this

750
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,909
is important and eventually our software

751
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,980
we'll get to a router that's finding an

752
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,720
interface and we'll go out and it'll

753
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,280
knock on the door the next router and

754
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,630
that routers not responding or it's

755
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,490
responding but who are you I'm not

756
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,290
letting you in so that's called a

757
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,679
dangling link we call it and it's

758
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:02,360
hanging out there and we flag it and

759
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,830
maybe it's connected to someone in the

760
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,389
supply chain that shouldn't be connected

761
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,960
to supply chain or maybe you've done an

762
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:11,570
M&A and this is a bank and there's some

763
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,429
bad things going on earth anyway there's

764
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:16,010
a million reasons why you can have the

765
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,540
unknowns and if you're the new C so the

766
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,790
first question the new C cell wants to

767
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,850
do tell me what I know tell me what I've

768
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,500
got so this is the response it's

769
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,010
terrible what's getting better but it's

770
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,220
not great and anything weakened and you

771
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,570
know we the army and in fact the

772
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,220
military in general has stood up these

773
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,750
things called cyber protection teams or

774
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:40,520
they carry lots of software on their

775
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,140
laptops instead of a m16 and they go in

776
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,090
and they do audits they to go out in the

777
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,320
forward operating bases wherever they

778
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,699
are in the world and they make sure

779
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,860
these networks are all good and that

780
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,419
they can be responsive so it's quite

781
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,219
exciting we're getting there and we're

782
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,840
learning a lot about this process of

783
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,660
people if they've got the req right

784
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,240
technology so there's a million things

785
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,150
if you everybody anybody run a sock

786
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,549
everybody everybody here had an incident

787
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,080
yeah you should go see one you should be

788
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:07,340
in the room when you have one I was in

789
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,110
the room once when a company in the

790
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,370
Midwest I won't say oh I'm staying there

791
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,939
we're doing this whole thing and all of

792
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,459
a sudden the alarm bells went off wow we

793
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,770
have a problem so but you know just

794
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,049
finding it is hard you know sometimes

795
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:23,600
people obscure the names of routers or

796
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,250
whatever you don't know what it is just

797
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,469
finding it's hard then the blast radius

798
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,269
just it's just what are my options what

799
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,999
can I do

800
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:32,479
I have heard I've never seen it be the

801
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,369
case

802
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:36,590
people actually unplug equipment if they

803
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:39,408
can't quite figure things out we

804
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:41,629
actually have one bank in New York who

805
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:43,669
through a remodeling had walled off a

806
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:45,080
data center just put up a wall and

807
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,419
everything behind it and we discovered

808
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,859
this data center where in our software

809
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,690
they haven't forgotten about it the

810
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:53,389
computers were on the lights were on it

811
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,309
was processing data but no one knew

812
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:56,928
about it it's just an example it's again

813
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:59,389
not nefarious on the part of the

814
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:00,979
customer the other company but it's just

815
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:03,590
the way our world has expanded so it's

816
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:05,119
not a straight line to success you need

817
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,769
good processes you got to know you're in

818
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,238
your outcomes you got to have technology

819
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:10,309
in hand you got to have people

820
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:12,830
the people are really important skill

821
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:14,570
people are hard so you know I love it

822
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,189
when I go to universities and even

823
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,499
anywhere actually and I hear about you

824
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,629
know people are taking cyber courses and

825
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:22,009
stuff but what's missing in the people

826
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,988
world I mean there's plenty of we needed

827
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,869
more engineers for sure and that and

828
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:28,849
process people and compliance people but

829
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:30,709
we also need is what I call the plumbers

830
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:33,649
painters and electricians at the cyber

831
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,720
world these are the folks who don't want

832
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:38,178
to do a college experience they want to

833
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,489
get a skilled job and labor we need

834
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,379
those people by the hundreds of

835
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:44,809
thousands to operate these socks that

836
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:47,209
everybody's putting up to control so

837
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,479
resilience is a strategy just to sum it

838
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,830
up starts in the c-suite you've got to

839
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:54,529
take it drive it through the enterprise

840
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:58,070
one of the things that you learn as a

841
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:59,539
public you can only do so much but you

842
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,070
can have standards and you can have

843
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,499
measurements and that gives you a

844
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,259
conversation when you're trying to solve

845
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:08,090
the problem we can do this better we

846
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:09,769
must do this better I really firmly

847
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,869
believe that Clark agrees with me and

848
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:12,499
many other people that resilience is the

849
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,509
future

850
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:17,989
it's not one product it's not one

851
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:20,359
company it's not one thing it's it's a

852
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:22,190
way of thinking to increase our trust

853
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,359
and confidence and capability and it

854
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,849
starts at the very top of the

855
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,220
organization so the key takeaways from

856
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:29,840
my book is it you got a frame resilience

857
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,129
is a business problem not a technical

858
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,109
gobbledygook that was the first set of

859
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:35,449
this technical gobbledy we got to stop

860
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:37,129
we just got to stop it

861
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,690
because you got to talk about it as if

862
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:40,459
it matters one of the things I suggest

863
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,380
in the book talk about cyber problems is

864
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,280
like competition

865
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,740
right what if the competition had access

866
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,299
ask what can go wrong this is a be

867
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,000
amazed people don't ask that good

868
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:53,889
engineers don't ask this question basic

869
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,280
cyber training for everyone this is now

870
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,929
pretty much happening everywhere even

871
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,639
when I remember we implemented at my

872
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,020
company red cell I went home and told my

873
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,610
wife about she's old can I take this

874
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,918
training sure and give it you know

875
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,689
because it's happening to everybody put

876
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,740
experts at the table it's an opportunity

877
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,090
for everybody in this room I'm sure

878
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,520
you're already in that in that

879
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,399
conversation but there's so many boards

880
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,449
that have not just boards but senior

881
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:19,000
management that don't have any

882
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,259
experience there's a lot of CISOs have

883
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,300
gotten to the top by being great

884
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,960
engineers and they were never trained to

885
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:28,240
talk about their job in words that the

886
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:33,220
business people understand metrics

887
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:37,178
matter and it's really key so I often

888
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:39,759
give talks to boards particularly public

889
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:42,010
boards because they don't have a cyber

890
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,470
person in the room they see their

891
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:47,050
buddies mentioned in the newspaper like

892
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:49,060
Equifax or whatever and they go we need

893
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,649
help and so I created a little bit of

894
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:54,179
checklist for them it's very similar to

895
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:56,618
the one you had before but then after I

896
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,350
scare the bejeebers out of people which

897
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:01,150
is real easy to do somebody you all

898
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,009
usually say what can I do

899
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,500
what's an individual to do and in fact

900
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm on a lot of radio talk shows and the

901
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,090
more early morning slot our commute time

902
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,080
talk shows right now talking because

903
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,460
they're interesting these are small

904
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,799
business people that listen the radio

905
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,270
going to work what do we do learn to

906
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,550
recognize what a phishing email is all

907
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,350
about and delete it if if it's important

908
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,970
it'll come back if it's legitimate it'll

909
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,900
come back and if you delete it often

910
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,060
enough and they really need you they'll

911
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,500
pick up the phone and call used

912
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,930
two-factor authentication whenever you

913
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,600
can make backups of course upgrade

914
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,730
everything keep it is not up to snuff as

915
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,200
you possibly can the JPMorgan attack was

916
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:40,440
one unupgraded NT server it started it

917
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,509
manage your passwords this is hard I

918
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,490
probably have 300 different logins and I

919
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,109
use a product called one password that's

920
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,089
had the heck pounded out of it by the

921
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,700
bad guys but so far it's it's holding

922
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:53,710
but this is really key and I'm sure you

923
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,060
all know that you know don't go to

924
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,190
Starbucks and do a bunch of

925
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,190
banking transactions you know they don't

926
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,920
do it on airplanes oh my gosh these

927
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,240
Wi-Fi public Wi-Fi things they people

928
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,740
sit in the parking lot and sniff them

929
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,299
again I'm sure I'm preaching to the

930
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,620
crowd and then lock your credit cards

931
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,150
think before you act just like you

932
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,540
wouldn't walk into a strange building

933
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,760
why should you go to a strange website

934
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,770
just think before you act

935
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,810
so I think we are in a path hopefully

936
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,330
that people will think differently

937
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,790
I know resilience can deliver confidence

938
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,620
it has let you to walk into this

939
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,300
building today so sit in these chairs

940
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,740
and not worry about the building falling

941
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,100
down not worrying about the power going

942
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,560
out not worrying about a fire that's the

943
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,310
kind of mentality it'll take time that

944
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,529
we need in our cyber world to get there

945
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:48,040
so that's my story I hope you've enjoyed

946
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:53,770
it we've got some time for questions I

947
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:57,509
think yeah yeah and but you guys know

948
00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:06,700
more about this than I do probably so

949
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:07,660
okay thank you thank you very much do we

950
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,210
have questions we have a microphone

951
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:15,890
there if you can step to the mic oh okay

952
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:18,680
all right make it work

953
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,900
good morning thank you for the great

954
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,109
presentation thank you question as a CEO

955
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,819
working in cyber a long time Elizabeth

956
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:28,999
Warren has recently submitted some

957
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:32,808
legislation that would make the lack of

958
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:35,269
cyber diligence e criminal for the CEOs

959
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:36,589
do you do you think something that is

960
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,499
needed and do you think that it would

961
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,328
actually change your CEO peers and the

962
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:43,129
way that they think about cyber and then

963
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,999
their the way that they budget whether

964
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,410
they resource their cyber teams just

965
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,730
that is a great question and it scares

966
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,489
the heck out of me

967
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,950
yeah it'll change their behavior just so

968
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:56,839
you may recall the SEC now it's criminal

969
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,379
when you sign these financial statements

970
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:01,819
and stuff and follow with the SEC if you

971
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,230
when you sign it you're not liable for

972
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:05,390
it even though you may not understand

973
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,609
every word in there but therefore you

974
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,859
will have to put in place as CEO signing

975
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:11,390
that document which as a director now I

976
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,150
even have to sign that document in a

977
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,730
public company we have to ensure that

978
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,880
there is a system of people processes

979
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,499
and technology that will get us the data

980
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,989
so that I feel confident enough to sign

981
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,488
that so yes I think it could be very

982
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:28,369
effective unfortunately it's a little

983
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:30,730
bit of a sledge hammer but you know it's

984
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:34,220
a it's a place to start a conversation

985
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:37,009
related to that I get I talk to a lot of

986
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,238
state legislators because a lot of the

987
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:39,380
states are frustrated with the

988
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,380
government the government's been trying

989
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,690
to pass cyber stuff for a long time NIST

990
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,690
is working hard that's very popular in

991
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,970
the SANS Institute in the sea-ice but I

992
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,950
think the states and if you if you think

993
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,200
but that's really where your information

994
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,098
lives that's where your property that's

995
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,230
where the information about your

996
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:00,170
property your driving records all that

997
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,299
stuff is really state or local only your

998
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,579
only your federal income tax information

999
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:05,809
is really more in the fat in here of

1000
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:09,079
course if you're in the military all

1001
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:10,579
your personality but States I think is

1002
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,599
where the action needs to happen first

1003
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:14,329
yes sir

1004
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,599
okay let's see can you hear me okay yeah

1005
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:20,239
two questions one is have you seen any

1006
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,369
traction in terms of helping assess the

1007
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,109
consequences to different risks and

1008
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:25,770
cyber security I know the insurance

1009
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:28,560
companies working on it because they see

1010
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,550
as a growth industry but also they have

1011
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,110
to make sure they make money as well yes

1012
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:37,950
there is a lot talking about there in

1013
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,900
fact Wall Street the bankers have these

1014
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,910
buckets of industries or you know

1015
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,020
firewalls network protection intrusion

1016
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,460
and now there's this thing called risk

1017
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,009
management and used to be a little tiny

1018
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,720
thing with about ten companies in it now

1019
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,060
there's about 50 companies in its

1020
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,730
growing 50% a year so it's the one of

1021
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,710
the fastest growing buckets risk

1022
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,050
management risk assessment and trying to

1023
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:59,580
figure out where the problems are

1024
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,960
because aboard if a board asks the

1025
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,210
question as a board member yelling you

1026
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,910
do three things I can take the company's

1027
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,490
treasurer and invest buy things or fix

1028
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,029
it myself build it I can ignore it at

1029
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,629
your peril

1030
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,910
or I can insure it well I don't know

1031
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,440
burning down the factory is not you know

1032
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,850
insurance money rebuild a factory but

1033
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,010
I've lost revenue and employees and

1034
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,480
everything else so that's not cyber

1035
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,000
insurance is coming but I don't think

1036
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,340
it's a real option just yet so I think

1037
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,410
your face would do nothing or start

1038
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,910
doing the Treasury and therefore I need

1039
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,250
to know where to put my precious

1040
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,660
Treasury dollars in that order and how

1041
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,220
do I do that through measurement risk

1042
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,160
assessment and understanding what to do

1043
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,689
so it's a circular path on that so the

1044
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,730
question the second question is related

1045
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,870
to the process people technology and I

1046
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,610
encountered at doing knowledge

1047
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,799
management operations in both Germany

1048
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,590
and Iraq and one of the things we try to

1049
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,030
do was anticipate what's gonna happen

1050
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,010
because if you put all those three

1051
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,750
factors together based on yesterday's

1052
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,370
news and maybe too late

1053
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,310
mm-hm so how does the Red Seal address

1054
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,930
that well House red still address that

1055
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,920
well you're right I think resilience is

1056
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,390
all but you don't know what's gonna

1057
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,640
happen you have to ask yourself what can

1058
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:11,879
go wrong you got obviously study and

1059
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:14,400
learn but you know simulation is a very

1060
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,490
powerful learning tool pilots go through

1061
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,650
a lot of simulation we simulate you know

1062
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,479
oil flow in the ground we simulate a lot

1063
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,940
of stuff to figure out how to manage and

1064
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,070
deal with stuff so Red Seal when we

1065
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,990
build this model of your network it is a

1066
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,600
it is a model just like a spreadsheet is

1067
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:33,689
a model it has formulas and you can you

1068
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,600
can do virtual penetration testing you

1069
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,970
can remove a piece that you can deform a

1070
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,269
router malformed or routers routing

1071
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,399
table

1072
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:46,618
to see what happens so you can simulate

1073
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:49,259
what would happen if something in my DMZ

1074
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,779
were to get infected and how far it can

1075
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:53,609
go and what could it do so having the

1076
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,890
ability to do that automatically is

1077
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:57,659
pretty powerful and and it's really more

1078
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,308
if you you may remember the

1079
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,699
semiconductor back in the 80s you know

1080
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:04,589
suddenly we were simulating chips right

1081
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:05,969
we didn't have to build a chip to test

1082
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,038
it we could actually just simulate it

1083
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:10,409
all in software

1084
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,959
red seals technology is very similar to

1085
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:15,149
that chip design software you can design

1086
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:17,759
the network you can test the network you

1087
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:20,009
can even extract the routing tables for

1088
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:21,599
the intended purpose of the network from

1089
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:24,689
our software so very much like what we

1090
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,279
did in chips and the 30 years ago we can

1091
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:27,569
do it the network world with red cell

1092
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:30,029
and many other things by that we don't

1093
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:35,969
do it all but but the ability to

1094
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:40,109
simulate is is critical yeah yes sir so

1095
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:41,789
as the SEC and many other federal agents

1096
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:43,619
or federal agencies in other countries

1097
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:46,139
let's say require publicly traded

1098
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,939
companies to provide accurate statements

1099
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:52,549
on their financial records wouldn't a

1100
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:54,388
some sort of requirement to state their

1101
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:55,979
state of security

1102
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:58,649
whatever that is we'd have to define

1103
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:00,689
that wouldn't that be potentially a

1104
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:03,388
helpful way to understand the risk that

1105
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:05,759
these companies bring to those who use

1106
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:07,049
their services or products I completely

1107
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:11,759
agree

1108
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:13,799
yeah the SEC is probably the I don't say

1109
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:16,079
it's a hammer but it's a soft hammer

1110
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:17,489
because usually when the SEC implements

1111
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,619
something they do it over a period of

1112
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:21,829
time and they look at the size of

1113
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:25,259
companies you know the whole

1114
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:27,179
sarbanes-oxley stuff was grouped out

1115
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:28,739
like that but there should be something

1116
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,269
and the first question about you know

1117
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:33,179
I'm signing a piece of paper that says

1118
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:35,609
I'm sorry capable or whatever

1119
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,699
yeah the SEC is the place to start not

1120
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:40,229
the DHS the SEC because the way you get

1121
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,839
a company's attention is you talk about

1122
00:43:40,229 --> 00:43:44,519
money right board has finite amount of

1123
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,558
money there's a budget there's products

1124
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,928
there's innovation am I gonna Rob the

1125
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,289
R&D budget in order to spend another 10

1126
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:52,740
10 million on a billion on cyber you

1127
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,869
don't want

1128
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,640
- but that's the choice that's having to

1129
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:58,349
be made because it's a it's a closed

1130
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,930
system right if I have to make a profit

1131
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:02,220
and I have to innovate in order to stay

1132
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,470
competitive I mean you can just imagine

1133
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,500
the the inner workings but I think the

1134
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:09,149
SEC is exactly the places I've some of

1135
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,010
my friends and while I see occasionally

1136
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,980
language but I don't think they're very

1137
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:16,800
serious about it yet yeah it's you know

1138
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:24,380
differently let me know maybe we should

1139
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:28,320
write it for them that'd be fun yes so

1140
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:33,650
so your concept of resilience is is a

1141
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:38,220
very useful one you're saying that my

1142
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:39,570
infrastructure has the ability to you

1143
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,118
know continue to function

1144
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:46,109
despite attacks something like that

1145
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:49,290
right yes yeah so that's good so but III

1146
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:52,890
think that the biggest problem in

1147
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:56,759
security is knowing what are my

1148
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:59,670
requirements so there are you know

1149
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,560
security is all about preserving some

1150
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:05,640
fundamental properties of encryption of

1151
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:08,130
confidentiality integrity access access

1152
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,680
control authorization so but the

1153
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,480
question is and and there are tools to

1154
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,830
enforce those properties at all the

1155
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
different protocol layer starting from

1156
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:18,089
the physical layer all the way up to the

1157
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,160
application the question is what is my

1158
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:22,619
policy you know if I what are my

1159
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,920
requirements in a complex system with

1160
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,080
you know 14,000 or 15,000 routers what

1161
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,220
is my policy it's very hard to know so

1162
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,490
if you don't know what your policy is

1163
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:35,339
then how are you going to try security

1164
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,848
so how do we know what the policy is

1165
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:41,190
that yeah so requirements what do I want

1166
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,710
yeah no that's a good point so there are

1167
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,750
standards obviously then in different

1168
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,130
organs I things like that there are

1169
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,630
standards out there but the real policy

1170
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,990
is the one that make you operate safely

1171
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,550
so like I said target may or may not

1172
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,250
have had a policy that said there was a

1173
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,230
connection from the HVAC to the point of

1174
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,460
sale that I'm sure they didn't have I'm

1175
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,339
sure they have a policy where they do

1176
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,380
now but so you have to think about that

1177
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,820
as the operator of anything you've got

1178
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,240
to think about what those processes are

1179
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,420
what

1180
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,459
matters to you what's important to you

1181
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,440
you know if if you're in the financial

1182
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,430
business speed may be really important

1183
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,750
or do it you know some sort of

1184
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,190
encryption may be important but you

1185
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,170
gotta have policies and therefore

1186
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,970
implement it but I think what's missing

1187
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,230
there are a lot of policies that all the

1188
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,399
companies I visit all the large

1189
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,440
companies I've is they have lots of

1190
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,060
policies but they can't prove that

1191
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,010
they've been instead been instituted

1192
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:32,330
properly they can't tell when the policy

1193
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,260
is out of compliance military big base

1194
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,569
guy says you know I want to have a

1195
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,140
connection from my base to my generals

1196
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,760
base over here so he says ok great Mis

1197
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,118
get in there and they type some stuff

1198
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,410
and suddenly there's a connection really

1199
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,760
so what if you could ask what if you

1200
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,009
when you were you were the colonel in

1201
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,560
charge to that SLOC or that network

1202
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,540
operations you can say you know yes sir

1203
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,670
I can do that but let me tell you you're

1204
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,890
gonna open up 500 new vulnerabilities

1205
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,350
between here and there when I make that

1206
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,670
connection policy says I can't do that

1207
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,410
but Sir I'll do it for you you can

1208
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,850
override that policy the point is you

1209
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,368
give them the tools you give them the

1210
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,200
analytics to take it to the leadership

1211
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:13,080
level to make a decision that's where

1212
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,189
that's what's missing and a big I think

1213
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,650
that's a little bit to what your point

1214
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,390
is it weakens by the way the software we

1215
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,130
we interpret policies we can actually

1216
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,839
print it out what we think you know

1217
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,000
Enclave a should or should not talk on

1218
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,950
clay B we give you that kind of

1219
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,430
information and you can say oh that's

1220
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:34,040
bad or great so ya process yeah yeah you

1221
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:39,230
bet that's that's a good question that's

1222
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:43,380
early days yes sir yeah I had a question

1223
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:45,119
regarding what you see from companies in

1224
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,700
terms of the definition of resilience

1225
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,410
you know is our yeah I'm sure there's a

1226
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,529
wide spectrum you mentioned some of your

1227
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,480
clients are they trying to stop

1228
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:58,100
adversaries like nation-states or is

1229
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,140
their primary adversary like the SEC or

1230
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,549
you know what's what's there forever can

1231
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,690
you give us a flavor of the different

1232
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,010
definitions you're getting for

1233
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,200
resilience when you work with companies

1234
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,390
yeah that's a that's a good question let

1235
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,950
me think about that so resilient it up

1236
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,618
writing will go on the dictionary its

1237
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,779
surviving an impairment of some sort how

1238
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:18,350
do you survive that impairment and the

1239
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,350
world doesn't know you've been impaired

1240
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,930
you know you may just

1241
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,220
as an example I think it was July of

1242
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,839
2016

1243
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:30,430
United Airlines Wall Street Journal and

1244
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,530
one other company in New York all went

1245
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,960
out at the same time it all went down

1246
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:37,780
websites went dark United Airlines

1247
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,520
reservation system went out all at the

1248
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,230
same moment and I remember my Twitter

1249
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,240
feed blew ups like oh my god run her

1250
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:46,060
cyber attack you knows no it was a

1251
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,709
router upgrade it was a router upgrade a

1252
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,690
scheduled router upgrade now that was

1253
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,060
just a three that reported it and made

1254
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:55,110
the news how many thousands of other it

1255
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:59,710
was a Cisco router upgrade by the way

1256
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:02,320
but so was that wasn't more those

1257
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:04,510
systems resilient well maybe some were

1258
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,090
maybe some weren't you know we have in

1259
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:10,360
our business world we have disaster

1260
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:12,310
recovery that's a form of resilience we

1261
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,220
have business continuity that's a form

1262
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:17,350
of resilience but what we don't have is

1263
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,819
if and and both of those are pretty

1264
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,650
severe right Contin you know your

1265
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,530
business processes are broken you can't

1266
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,860
collect revenue that was targets issue

1267
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:29,020
and then disaster recovery we of course

1268
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,180
all live through the 9/11 events and

1269
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,259
what happened to a lot of that but

1270
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,640
there's something in the middle and

1271
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,200
that's where we are with cyber's like

1272
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,480
what if I just get in and mess around

1273
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,810
with you a little bit what if I just

1274
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,160
tinker with your systems a little bit

1275
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,960
and slow you down that's what that's

1276
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,210
what Stuxnet was right

1277
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,820
Stuxnet went to the Iranian centrifuges

1278
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,260
and fooled them that they were doing

1279
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:54,190
fine but they were putting on junk in

1280
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:57,940
the back end so that's that's the

1281
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:03,070
resilience thing taken to a real deep

1282
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:05,890
level so other examples you know this

1283
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:07,270
these cyber protection teams that the

1284
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,859
Army has stood up there are five

1285
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,740
thousand on these like say these are

1286
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:15,190
guys and gals that carry laptops instead

1287
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:17,319
of instead of rifles their mission of

1288
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:20,710
course is to play the what if game they

1289
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,600
simulate they simulate these these

1290
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,750
networks and the forward operating base

1291
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,160
and all that so I've actually seen some

1292
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,990
of those acting and they they will hire

1293
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,759
red teams right to come in and try to do

1294
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:34,419
the penetration so that's a form of

1295
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,580
resilience it's it's it's interest

1296
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,260
if you had a fire no one reports well

1297
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,799
the sprinkler system worked they don't

1298
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:44,330
say that

1299
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:47,510
but it did probably if it didn't work

1300
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:50,000
you sure it didn't you knew that other

1301
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,370
you know physical resilient systems are

1302
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,520
seat belts and airbags those are things

1303
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:57,200
but in the in the cyber world if if you

1304
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,950
survive an attack and you don't tell the

1305
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,759
world about it

1306
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:05,509
that is Nirvana right that is good news

1307
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,580
sony couldn't hide i'm you know only the

1308
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:09,740
ones who reading the newspaper can you

1309
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:13,190
imagine how many others i do know of a

1310
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:15,109
large who was one of resilience this is

1311
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,270
a company that builds nuclear power

1312
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,600
plants and other large infrastructure

1313
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:25,970
things they had a massive attack from

1314
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:28,370
our friends to the east and they were

1315
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:30,049
not very resilient and they had to go

1316
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,670
through a massive forensics so now they

1317
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,920
are prepared to be resilient they've

1318
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:36,230
they've got the right alarm bells they

1319
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,910
can shut down their network with a flip

1320
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,310
of a switch they can just close the

1321
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:42,259
ports and go silent but they have to

1322
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,400
stay open and order stay in business i

1323
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,830
can't mention the name of the company

1324
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,380
obviously but that is an example of one

1325
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:50,779
where they did not survive then they

1326
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,400
came back and that's the kind of

1327
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,170
resented

1328
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,040
thats we don't hear about the ones that

1329
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,320
work so yep just yeah how open this

1330
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,410
coming from the homeland security side

1331
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,330
of things yeah it was DHS a long time

1332
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,399
resilience they really focus on the

1333
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,380
design so that you have the minimal

1334
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,120
impact right then the detection the

1335
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,940
response to recovery and you're sort of

1336
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,430
referring you're sort of considering

1337
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,590
like the response to a disaster to be

1338
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,319
the resiliency and i think of it more as

1339
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:23,210
a design of the system the front-end do

1340
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,460
seeing the impact for it so i think

1341
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:28,310
these are all aspects of it but I think

1342
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,770
for the best resilient system you have

1343
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:33,500
to start from the front and a lot of

1344
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:35,509
companies need help with the existing

1345
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,860
systems that are out there but helping

1346
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,420
them come up with that design and

1347
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,040
understand that and that's where the

1348
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,730
measurement is of course a key component

1349
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,650
right yeah you're absolutely right if if

1350
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,370
we could turn it all off and rebuild it

1351
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:50,480
we build it

1352
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:52,490
wouldn't we but we can't so that's why

1353
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,600
we get to that well that's part of it

1354
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,220
yeah that's part of this response

1355
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,049
capability and if you think about okay

1356
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,730
I'm gonna build a bill I gotta go in and

1357
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,770
I got a retrofit the sprinklers I got a

1358
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,940
retrofit everything that's what people

1359
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,850
are doing that's what they're spending

1360
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:07,040
money on I'm buying new routing

1361
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,480
equipment or whatever it is but you got

1362
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,830
to know what you have in order you you

1363
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,390
you couldn't retrofit this building if

1364
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,860
you didn't have the blueprints it'd be

1365
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,480
like you know the architects standing

1366
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,530
outside taking the few photographs walk

1367
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,760
around them and take pictures and then

1368
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,050
say okay we're gonna change this and

1369
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:24,380
that's like I don't even know what the

1370
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:26,090
doors are no the windows are and that

1371
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,190
does that's why you have to have the

1372
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,510
analytics right that's why now they come

1373
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,830
in the architects come in with drones

1374
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,630
and they fly through a building and they

1375
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:34,310
collect all the information lidar and

1376
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,450
all that stuff that's really amazing but

1377
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,270
that's where we are that's the state of

1378
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:39,140
the world so we got and like I said is

1379
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,940
livin the DIA

1380
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,640
I should be careful I guess I've already

1381
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,380
blown that we found stuff in the cloud

1382
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,170
they thought was right and it wasn't

1383
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,800
that's okay it happens you know these

1384
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:54,790
are just human beings we make mistakes

1385
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:58,490
yeah I probably probably blew that yeah

1386
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:00,050
I'll move you along quickly okay so this

1387
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:02,419
goes back to the first question and this

1388
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:04,040
may be an unfair question is can you

1389
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,230
talk at all when you've seen two really

1390
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,440
good companies that embrace this

1391
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,760
resilient perspective you know you come

1392
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,580
to him and say listen you got a score of

1393
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,350
800 or 800 and maybe for what you're

1394
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,440
doing you need a score of 8/10 or pick a

1395
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:20,900
number it's gonna cost you this much to

1396
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,990
get there the consequence of not doing

1397
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,250
it is gonna cost you this much so

1398
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,009
there's some risk assessments and

1399
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,960
there's some investment decisions that

1400
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,940
have to be made how do they handle those

1401
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,310
yeah given the kind of like Victorian to

1402
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,610
this developing world or risk assessment

1403
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,610
right now

1404
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:43,150
how do they handle that well when given

1405
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,760
their focus on them yeah yeah but you're

1406
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,010
talking about the arbitrage right so

1407
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,710
it's a big deal one you know when I'm

1408
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:53,950
getting that first meeting with a CSO or

1409
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:55,270
CIO they I ask them things like do I

1410
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,549
know what I do I know what my

1411
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:59,380
infrastructure looks like but the most

1412
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:03,520
important question is what's important

1413
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:05,530
to you if if a leader can tell me what's

1414
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,759
important to them then I know they're

1415
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,590
thinking about it and they're already

1416
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,740
halfway there and then it's a matter of

1417
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,060
assessing the cost the risk and doing

1418
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,520
the probabilities building that big

1419
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,590
decision tree to decide what to do but

1420
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,130
in fact I think it was under President

1421
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,900
Obama

1422
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,920
he put a edict out all the agencies were

1423
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,140
supposed to figure out where their

1424
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,290
pressure where their precious assets

1425
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:29,109
where their important assets were with

1426
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:30,759
regard to information and that went

1427
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:34,330
often answered those questions but until

1428
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,910
that was just two or three years ago so

1429
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,840
that's a key question I said to you what

1430
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:40,509
matters to you

1431
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,730
I just recently was it clear this

1432
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:44,110
company that has the biometric stuff at

1433
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,460
the airports and you know they're just

1434
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,830
they're deploying they want to deploy

1435
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,640
this everywhere we you want you couldn't

1436
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:55,750
walk in this building without a clear

1437
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:57,310
can you imagine the the risk assessment

1438
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,020
that they have to do and the false

1439
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,910
positive issues that they have to deal

1440
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,980
with all that goes into that calculation

1441
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:06,399
about what to do and they are very keen

1442
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:09,490
on I said take me on a sales call I was

1443
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,190
talking to the head of the seaso who's

1444
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:14,379
not really a sales guy he's sort of a

1445
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:17,620
swashbuckling bearded guy a little

1446
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:21,250
overweight rides a motorcycle but but

1447
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:22,810
brilliant absolutely brilliant I said so

1448
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,100
take me on the sales call how do you how

1449
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,040
do you describe what you do how do you

1450
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,180
say how do you do that risk assessment

1451
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,830
because what they're claiming is they're

1452
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,589
gonna make the fidelity of who walks

1453
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,000
through the door better and it's very

1454
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,500
complicated but it always starts with

1455
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,850
what's important that he said the same

1456
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,310
thing so we always ask the customer

1457
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:41,080
what's important to you I file that one

1458
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,540
bad guy in out of a hundred thousand at

1459
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,730
a football game

1460
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,560
is that okay you know there's no such

1461
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,579
thing as perfect risk so you got to

1462
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,249
assess that problem

1463
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:53,859
and that's hard in the cyber world we

1464
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:55,808
work with AIG and AIG on and some of the

1465
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:57,939
other folks to to get there but it's a

1466
