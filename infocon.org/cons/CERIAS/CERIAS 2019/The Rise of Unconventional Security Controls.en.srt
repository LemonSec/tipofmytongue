1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:07,140
we've heard from a lot of people who are

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,710
practitioners researchers and policy

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,620
makers over these two days one of the

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,350
areas that we had some discussions in

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,930
the area of healthcare this is something

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,730
that has a number of very interesting

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,769
security components to it and privacy so

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,650
when we think about security and

9
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,990
healthcare their issues having to do

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,940
with protection and medical equipment

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,399
dosages their supply chain there's

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,440
financial interest there's privacy of

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,329
consumer records

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,110
these are targets certainly for

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,110
criminals for others but I wanted to

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,180
mention another aspect of this that may

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,699
not be immediately obvious there was a

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:56,820
news report this morning that the same

19
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:59,489
or very similar Russian troll farms that

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,140
were involved in attempting to you so

21
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,700
dissent with the election by some of the

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,490
various activities the rumors of

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,350
political posturing they have have also

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,140
been involved in attempting to so

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,720
descent into you American culture by

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,100
joining forces and amplifying the voices

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,270
of those who are against vaccines do you

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,780
try to add further dissent and distrust

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,189
established institutions in the country

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,259
they've been acting a lot of these very

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:35,189
same kinds of arguments about trusting

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,960
vaccinations trusting the medical

33
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,408
establishment and that's part of our

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,189
medical arena so if you think about it

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,780
you can go down to your local drugstore

36
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:51,960
and you can go in and you can get a

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,000
vaccination against flu or Eagles or

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,619
shingles and that's part of the

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
healthcare apparatus that we have

40
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,869
throughout the country all of that needs

41
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,060
to be protected the supply chain the

42
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,799
payroll for the employees the the

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,860
medication records many of which are

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,770
controlled by federal law vaccinations

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,560
all kinds of parts of this this very

46
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,720
large healthcare arena and that's a

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,090
challenge and I can't think of anybody

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,250
who's really better suited to deal with

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,930
some of those challenges that our final

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,709
key no Jim Ralph is the CSO of CBS

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,959
health and leads the effort to secure

52
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,500
their enterprise it came to this

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,540
position when CBS and Aetna

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,530
joined he was the previous leader CSO

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,530
and business division

56
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,950
he's also been chair of the health I sac

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,030
port which is the industry sharing

58
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,760
Association

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,470
he's formerly the head of security at

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,040
Morgan Chase a chief information

61
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,349
security officer for KPMG the depository

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,540
pressing the reporters American Express

63
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,010
so this is someone who's had a great

64
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,190
deal of experience in high stress

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,890
environments and he it's shown in some

66
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,750
of the significant industry awards that

67
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,000
he's received including the Avanza

68
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,250
breakaway leaders award the Security

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,980
Alliance Innovation Award the is a

70
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,739
luminary award the bits

71

Leadership Award some of these are

72
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,260
listed in the program there are many

73
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,209
more he brings decades worth of

74
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,250
experience to an incredibly showering in

75
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,900
position and he's going to tell us about

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,290
some of those challenges and his vision

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,959
and his talk to close out the 2019

78
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,959
surgery symposium please join me

79
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:52,049
so I'm at the point in my career can you

80
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,730
hear me as a mic on yeah okay I'm at the

81
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,939
point in my career where I'm better

82
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,969
known for what I used to do which is

83
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,189
kind of an age thing but I tell you

84
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:06,569
coming here is really helpful for me

85
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:08,670
because I feel young because Spath was

86
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,828
one of the persons that you know was

87
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,010
instrumental teaching me fundamentals of

88
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:18,150
cybersecurity a long time ago and you're

89
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:21,329
still going really strong so and so I'm

90
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:24,239
impressed and I feel young so so thank

91
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,300
you for that it was it was it was worth

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,750
it so I'm gonna share with you my

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,860
philosophy and I'm gonna start with

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,349
definition of what resiliency is see

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,770
resiliency when I started was very

96
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,120
simple no security breaches and at a

97
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,330
point in time you know a couple of

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
decades ago that was reasonable it's not

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,250
reasonable today and as a matter of fact

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,729
many say that we're losing the war in

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,620
cyber security to the criminals and to

102
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,870
the nation state-sponsored threat actors

103
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,030
and there's a pretty good argument for

104
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,440
that and some compelling reason for that

105
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,859
which does it it isn't all that

106
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,620
inspiring to be a cyber security

107
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,360
professional right and so at least some

108
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,710
of you of course most of most of the

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,229
students are in the back is that they

110
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,960
just know more is that why so most of

111
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:15,990
you that are students today it's not all

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,270
that inspiring you know a motivation to

113
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,960
think about you're gonna join a losing

114
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,609
cause right it's not all that compelling

115
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,180
and so what I'm suggesting to you is

116
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,310
change the definition of resiliency for

117
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,289
an enterprise and resiliency for an

118
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,680
enterprise from my definition is an

119
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:38,039
enterprise that can recover quickly with

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,050
minimal business impact which means that

121
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,960
you're gonna have many security

122
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,620
incidents so the enterprise that I work

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:50,099
for just in the cyber side we have 300 a

124
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,259
year so that's the average of what we

125
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,479
have on an annual basis in terms of

126
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,120
security incidents we also have a lot of

127
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,860
synthetic security incidents anybody

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,810
know what a synthetic security incident

129
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,130
is

130
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,790
okay I'll tell I'll explain that to you

131
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:08,310
I don't know how widely use term that is

132
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,090
but it's very simple when you test to

133
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,300
control

134
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,460
that's a synthetic incident so if you do

135
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,760
a red team review that's a synthetic

136
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,830
incident so capturing lessons learned

137
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,380
from incidents is kind of a essential

138
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,000
and I mentioned that resilience is where

139
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,880
we change a lot so here's part of my

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,360
philosophy which is basically respond

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,100
quickly which is essentially building

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,210
into an enterprise the same fundamental

143
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,430
mechanisms that are in place in your

144
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:46,200
body in your immune system so you get

145
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:49,139
exposed to bacteria and viruses every

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,110
day and the way your body responds to

147
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,030
that is your body sends any bodies to

148
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,080
attack the bacteria that enter your

149
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,869
system and your body recovers and

150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,300
responds sometimes you know without any

151
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,530
side effects whatsoever sometimes you

152
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,160
might catch a cold

153
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,280
as a result but you get better now the

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,960
better your immune system is so less you

155
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,940
feel the effects of getting exposed

156
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,450
enterprises need an immune system that

157
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,690
allows anyone at any level to surface a

158
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,270
problem and anyone at any level to be

159
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,880
able to solve a problem solving a

160
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,889
problem improving processes to make

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,919
processes more efficient and effective

162
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,020
well that's resiliency and your cyber

163
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,030
security practices can be the best in

164
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,070
the world if you don't have a foundation

165
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:46,650
of being able to discover big problems

166
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:50,479
talk about big problems even in the

167
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,979
boardroom and then solve big problems

168
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,680
doesn't matter how good your security

169
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:59,060
controls are your Nevele or chief

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,060
resiliency from enterprise perspective

171
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,479
so I'm an acquired taste for as I see so

172
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:08,219
I'm just telling you that because one of

173
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,340
the first things I tell the board and I

174
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,990
did this recently for the CBS board as I

175
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,630
said I guarantee you you will have

176
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,440
or security incidents which typically

177
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,200
isn't compelling you know sales tactic

178
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,340
if you want to get a CSO job but the

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,340
reason for that is because we'll put

180
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,480
controls in place that have a better

181
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,709
opportunity to find control brakes

182
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,700
control brakes are where controls aren't

183
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,770
working

184
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,290
synthetic controls are part synthetic

185
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,850
incidents are part of that and part of

186
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,219
it is because you have better diagnostic

187
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:48,060
tools because we'll know what risks

188
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:53,940
there are so the other thing is I don't

189
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:57,030
follow what my peers do and I listen to

190
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,690
a lot of smart people spaff being one of

191
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,610
them

192
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,480
that's have you know tremendous impact

193
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:07,740
on what I do but I pay little attention

194
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,480
to what my peer group does specifically

195
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,920
what controls they're using in their

196
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:18,240
environment now the reason for that is

197
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:22,560
largely a threat actor is somebody that

198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,570
I'm trying to create friction for and so

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,459
some of that friction comes from having

200
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,620
controls in my environment that aren't

201
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:33,050
in other environments

202
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:36,930
and and I also use early stage companies

203
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,949
to drive innovation in control design

204
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,550
because that's where the innovation

205
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:45,600
comes from just largely for economic

206
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,829
reasons and I'll explain that so what

207
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm going to share with you in terms of

208
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,740
what I do

209
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:55,440
please shred it challenge it you throw

210
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,730
your best challenge at it I'm fine with

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,230
it but I and what I'm doing is not what

212
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:06,750
my most of my peers do so I mentioned

213
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,580
this in the panel that we had the

214
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,660
difference between compliance based and

215
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,330
risk based I'll give an example of this

216
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:19,680
you're familiar I think with these NIST

217
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,480
frameworks here these standards and from

218
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,729
a risk standpoint if we just look at

219
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,790
email I mentioned the Demark case I

220
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,070
won't mention that but these other

221
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,510
samples are unconventional controls

222
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,460
they're not part of a risk framework in

223
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,520
some cases you've never seen them before

224
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,690
but they're highly effective at driving

225
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,400
trust into an email system that all of

226
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,790
us are using today that doesn't have a

227
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,530
whole lot of trust in it in fact if we

228
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,980
look at the conventional side of the

229
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,140
house for email specifically phishing

230
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,850
which is the number one threat vector of

231
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,280
any enterprise today what the

232
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,800
authoritative sources tell us is teach

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,250
your employees in an enterprise to

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,819
recognize phishing attacks and kind of

235
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,970
the human firewall construct of you know

236
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,420
being smarter so let's look at that for

237
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,000
a minute in my organization we have a

238
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,000
world-class capability at teaching

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,580
people how to recognize phishing

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,530
capability when we do phishing tests

241
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,470
simulated tests synthetic incidents

242
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,240
another example when we share phishing

243
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,090
emails with someone and see if they

244
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,760
click on it we're at between five to

245
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,390
seven percent of people responding on

246
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,140
the bait of the phishing email as a

247
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,840
reference point ten percent is

248
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,350
world-class okay so we're in the

249
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,710
world-class level in terms of teaching

250
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,390
people to recognize phishing emails but

251
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,100
if we look at what that actually means

252
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,960
that means five to seven percent of

253
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,820
everybody that clicks on it gets hosed

254
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:09,270
right they're owned right and that's the

255
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,730
best that we can do so does that sound

256
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,620
like a sustainable model to you because

257
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,940
it doesn't to me emails kind of

258
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,580
important to my enterprises is it

259
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,090
important to yours so why are you

260
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,310
spending money and time to teach people

261
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,650
when the best that you can do is about

262
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,140
10% of people are still gonna click on

263
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,660
it and get owned right it's not a

264
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,670
sustainable model it happens to be what

265
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,790
our conventional wisdom and controls

266
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:40,020
tell us to do every authoritative source

267
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,770
says to do this there's a better way the

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,040
better way

269
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,270
is put trust into the email system by

270
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,469
using unconventional controls

271
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,149
unconventional controls don't exist in

272
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,930
the risk framework they're not discussed

273
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:58,740
by authoritative sources but an example

274
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:02,160
is if you write a script attached to

275
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,459
your email gateway that takes a feed

276
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,390
from a Intel provider that lists every

277
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:12,089
domain registered and then you flag any

278
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:17,240
email coming from a newly registered

279
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:20,790
domain and don't deliver it for 48 hours

280
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,670
you now have eliminated a large

281
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:29,060
percentage and source of your phishing

282
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:32,760
emails and your spam why because any

283
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,890
criminal that sets up a new domain sends

284
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,420
the majority of the email not first 48

285
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,850
hours because after that the spam

286
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,149
filters catch up and figure it out so

287
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:46,860
they're cycling through new domains so

288
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:50,370
no legitimate domain sends mass email on

289
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,170
day 1 day 1 you set up the domain you

290
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,170
gotta make sure it works right you send

291
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,550
email to your buddies or you know to the

292
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,319
administrators that's it you're not

293
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,510
sending massive emails so all you have

294
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,720
to do is drop that email the business

295
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,110
impact is like minimal and it's a simple

296
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,110
script that you write it's not a

297
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,520
conventional control but it works right

298
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,170
it's kind of a bootstrap kind of

299
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,730
approach that's an unconventional

300
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,380
control and that's the difference

301
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,209
between compliance based security and

302
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,339
risk driven security I'm going to show

303
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,099
you a couple other examples of that but

304
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,470
here's the deal there's a big gap

305
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,950
between these two and it's getting

306
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,230
bigger

307
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,329
and if you want resilience you got to be

308
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,820
over on this side you got to use

309
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:35,370
unconventional controls if you want to

310
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,649
avoid major security the business impact

311
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,980
of security breaches now any policy

312
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:46,050
walks in the room anybody recognize this

313
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:48,120
one that would be no ok

314
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,979
not any powers that that's ok that's

315
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,930
that speaks highly of you is an audience

316
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,699
just so you know if you answer that

317
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,130
question then I know you're really true

318
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,800
geek

319
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,019
so 800 177 is actually trusted email

320
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,540
it's a and it's actually Demark it's

321
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:05,380
what I mentioned earlier and this came

322
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,589
out with this in let's see was it three

323
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,029
years ago so it's an example of an

324
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,980
unconventional control that became a

325
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,829
conventional control now and eventually

326
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,029
unconventional controls do become

327
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:19,660
conventional controls it just takes a

328
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,689
cycle of time before the standards are

329
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,430
updated so if you're investing here

330
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,680
eventually they become conventional

331
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,430
controls okay so I'm gonna give you an

332
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,910
example here where this is the insurance

333
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,069
division of CBS we and this is like four

334
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,240
years old or five years old this data so

335
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,219
we had twenty nine thousand two hundred

336
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,750
thirty one server sending us email every

337
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,250
day and we treated every server the same

338
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,800
way that's why they're all grey dots

339
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,110
there right so then we did some

340
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,689
filtering of the servers based on the

341
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,170
domain attributes of the sending domain

342
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,839
not the attachments right not any

343
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,110
campaigns or anything that we looked at

344
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,750
pure attributes of the sending domain

345
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,250
and what we discovered is a breakdown

346
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,730
where fourteen thousand five hundred

347
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,360
twenty-six senders of email to us on a

348
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,779
daily basis are sending malicious email

349
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,389
so instead of just letting that email in

350
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,009
we decided to filter that email and not

351
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,459
deliver it now when you don't deliver

352
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:24,430
that email the user doesn't see that

353
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:26,079
email so if the users not seeing the

354
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,959
fourteen thousand you know the email

355
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,189
from 14,000 plus servers that sending

356
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,018
and then we're talking about you know

357
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,060
millions and millions of email messages

358
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:38,880
that aren't being seen what happens to

359
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,880
the experience of the user using email

360
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:47,560
it's improved there's less clutter

361
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:51,550
there's more legitimate email you

362
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,388
respond and react to the email you start

363
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,870
to trust the email more so these are

364
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:02,290
unconventional controls that actually

365
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,919
add trust into your email ecosystem

366
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,210
rather than extracting trust out at a

367
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,170
cost

368
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,090
so the second control that I'm going to

369
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,040
cover today is relatively new it's in

370
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:19,869
production today and it's basically

371
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,440
about 50% of the phishing emails that

372
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:27,609
get through all of our other filters are

373
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,790
stopped by this control and we're tuning

374
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:32,169
the algorithm and over time we think

375
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:37,060
that we're going to get that up into the

376
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:39,430
90s so we'll we'll take phishing emails

377
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,220
and in our enterprise and and take them

378
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:45,490
down to a trickle and the way we're

379
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,250
doing it the there's four types of

380
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,400
fishing there's four tactics that you

381
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,770
can use to send a phishing email

382
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,840
spoofing the main was one the display

383
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,520
look-alike domain was the second display

384
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,310
name deception is the third the fourth

385
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,200
one is the fastest-growing one so if you

386
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:05,290
look at in your enterprises the

387
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,410
fastest-growing phishing emails using

388
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:11,320
this tactic the tactic is simple I'm

389
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,370
gonna take credentials from my friend

390
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,659
and to my friends email and I'm gonna

391
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,000
send you have any friends in the room

392
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,650
here I mean I know they're friendly but

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,260
do you know anybody in the room here

394
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,360
yeah this guy thought so okay so what

395
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,120
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send an email

396
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,580
but I owned the credentials to her email

397
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,469
and I'm gonna send it to you you get

398
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,970
email from her all the time a lot of

399
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,100
times it has some pity humor that's

400
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,050
really cute you look forward to that but

401
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,879
this time I'm gonna be sending an email

402
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,550
you're not gonna know about it and

403
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,380
you're gonna think that it's the email

404
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,440
coming from here so you're gonna trust

405
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,730
it a lot more as a result of that and

406
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,070
it's gonna get through all the spam

407
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,470
filters and all of the inbound filters

408
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,780
because it's a legitimate email account

409
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,460
nobody knows that it's not I just own

410
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,170
the credentials for it so I'm sending

411
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,630
email from a compromised email account

412
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:08,560
that's the fastest-growing segment and

413
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,650
most commercial fraudsters are using

414
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,080
that technique more and more there is no

415
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,390
control today necessarily that we have

416
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,540
in place we have to design a control to

417
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,980
stop that particular tactic because the

418
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,950
other three tactics

419
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,840
I shared with you are all stopped by the

420
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,580
unconventional controls that I shared

421
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,740
but this last one is a bit more

422
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,820
challenging so what we're doing were

423
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,340
basically we created this algorithm

424
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,580
based on 200 billion emails that get

425
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,470
sent a year across all enterprises and

426
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:47,500
we are now filtering the email based on

427
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:51,250
attributes of how the email message was

428
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:55,510
written compared to what is normal by

429
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:59,470
the email account owner so you're smart

430
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:02,200
you know concise fit the kinds of emails

431
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,780
that you're accustomed to establishes a

432
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,020
pattern that we can represent

433
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:12,460
mathematically my blunt lousy English

434
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:16,090
you know types of emails that I write in

435
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:19,299
your account don't map to what is the

436
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,059
norm that you typically use and that

437
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,790
flags a risk score that's a deviation

438
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:28,360
from what the pattern is and that risk

439
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:31,540
score is fed into the inbound email

440
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,790
filtering capability and we decide what

441
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,950
to do if the risk score is high we drop

442
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,200
it and don't deliver the email because

443
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,470
it's from a compromised email account if

444
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,600
the risk score is low we send it through

445
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,669
unfettered so what we're doing is we're

446
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,668
mapping a bunch of attributes on the

447
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:51,669
actual email that's being sent and

448
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:54,760
whether the email gets distributed to a

449
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:57,250
large number of people or a small number

450
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,040
of people or the specific people all of

451
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:05,140
that is being mapped in this algorithm

452
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:09,399
that allows us to map the tag the email

453
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:12,580
itself to the account owner and provide

454
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,380
some sort of credibility score that we

455
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,480
can apply on the inbound side so we're

456
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,390
doing that today

457
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:26,200
and again we're we're at a point where

458
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:28,540
270,000 employees and I get somewhere

459
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,730
between four and seven phishing emails

460
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,100
that get through all of the controls

461
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,670
that we have in place today on that

462
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,230
basis

463
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,850
and I think that's pretty good but I've

464
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,350
been measuring that for five years and

465
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,750
it's as good as we've ever gotten and

466
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,520
any of you can do better than that I'm

467
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,670
all ears

468
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,400
so I mentioned security incidents and

469
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,010
that were really where we manufacture

470
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,530
incidents our Incident Response process

471
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,870
has this fifth step here which is

472
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,570
lessons learned there is no better way

473
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,570
to learn about the effectiveness of your

474
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,350
controls than an incident so don't let

475
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,740
it go to waste

476
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,840
celebrate it we get excited when we have

477
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,820
security incidents because we get to

478
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,429
learn something and we get to learn

479
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,370
something that we don't learn every day

480
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,930
and that's positive now a lot of people

481
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,699
think of security incentives like the

482
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,640
sky is falling and you know got to go

483
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,260
find a new job in our case we look

484
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,550
forward to this we celebrate the fact

485
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,470
that we have an incident because we get

486
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,590
to harvest the lessons learned and we

487
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:34,580
turn them into remediation plans that we

488
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,879
track and measure so an example is we

489
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,389
had a security incident these are

490
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,850
examples of the finding which is kind of

491
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:46,450
lessons learned the remediation item who

492
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,040
owns it and we track the target dates

493
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,950
for all of those 300 incidents that I

494
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,159
mentioned to you all of this is tracked

495
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,300
in terms of the remediation effort and

496
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,670
because we learned something from the

497
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,040
incidents we change and adjust our

498
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,440
priorities on the allocation of scarce

499
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,060
resource to the highest risk based on

500
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,380
what we learn from the incidents this is

501
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,060
the most valuable source of information

502
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,010
we have except for synthetic incidents

503
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:16,700
synthetic incidents are red teams that

504
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:19,310
we're doing or other internal control

505
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,650
testing that we do where we discover

506
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,090
that a control is not work and then we

507
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,560
follow the same process capture the

508
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:28,189
lessons learn and go through this so the

509
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,480
control break is essentially where you

510
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,890
in the cybersecurity organization this

511
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,740
determine that a control is not working

512
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,110
effectively and you treat it like an

513
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,660
incident you harvest the lessons learned

514
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,090
and you implement a remediation plan to

515
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,480
fix whatever you can do to fix that

516
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,139
control now if someone else discovers

517
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,360
that

518
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,730
then it's an auditable right an auditor

519
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,129
or regulator discovers that a little

520
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,700
more pain associated with that but

521
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:02,600
frankly you should be able to have some

522
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,090
rings of control review that are baked

523
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,610
in so what we do is we have we take the

524
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,040
top risks for the enterprise or in each

525
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,340
individual business and then we identify

526
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,678
the key controls the key top controls or

527
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,600
the top key controls that relate to

528
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,419
those risks and we test them

529
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,918
specifically every quarter we rotate

530
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:26,059
that every quarter so we're testing

531
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,429
always the top controls that align to

532
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,860
the top risks and we discover control

533
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:33,350
breaks and they're a lot less painful

534
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,030
when you discover them when auditors

535
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,250
don't discover them you allocate

536
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,460
resources to fix based on that so I'm

537
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:43,370
gonna change the paradigm a little bit

538
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,960
and I'm gonna talk about two things that

539
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,739
really don't belong together passwords

540
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,290
and people now we have 60 years of

541
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,169
history using passwords to protect the

542
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,389
enterprise and by and large it's done

543
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:59,870
it's done pretty well passwords have

544
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,530
done pretty well but the unfortunate

545
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:05,389
thing is that for all six years

546
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,820
passwords are based on a fundamental

547
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:12,080
principle the fundamental principle is

548
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,730
that you are the only person that has or

549
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,299
knows your secret

550
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,530
that's the principle and for 60 years

551
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:24,260
that served us well unfortunately that

552
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:27,620
principle or premise today that he's the

553
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,879
only one that has his password is no

554
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,239
longer valid and in fact every day it

555
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,080
becomes less valid and the reason for

556
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,700
that is that about five years ago

557
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,870
criminal syndicates cyber criminal

558
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:47,870
syndicates who by definition always look

559
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,928
for the easiest way to get into data

560
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,090
always they always look for the easiest

561
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:57,980
way what's the easiest way to get access

562
00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:01,699
to data today yeah yeah that's exactly

563
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:04,070
right using a password that

564
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,470
a legitimate credential however you do

565
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,689
your guessing it is good enough but

566
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,120
however you get access to it if you do

567
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,889
you provide that credential into the

568
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,070
system user ID and password combination

569
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:18,979
and what does the system do it trusts

570
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,740
you that's what all our systems are

571
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:27,340
designed to do and the reason for that

572
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:32,480
is authentication when we learned

573
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:35,029
technology a few years ago technology

574
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,970
taught us that authentication was an

575
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:41,539
event at a beginning and had an end and

576
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:44,840
a binary outcome and for all of these

577
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:47,690
years that baked into the way we think

578
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,149
about authentication and it's baked into

579
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,860
the fabric of every authentication

580
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:58,189
control that we use in the enterprise

581
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:59,990
today it's obsolete its obsolete simply

582
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,049
because every binary control can be

583
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,929
defeated so if I'm taking user ID and

584
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:09,168
password I'm adding on to it a SMS push

585
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:13,880
of a one-time password to a mobile

586
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:17,120
device and the user consumer who always

587
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,850
gets inflicted with the security control

588
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,399
the user has to take that password enter

589
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,799
it into the website if they're using the

590
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,039
website and then they they get in right

591
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,679
well what if the criminal the cyber

592
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,899
criminals using the ss7 vulnerability

593
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,409
and he's sending that one-time password

594
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:39,620
to their the criminals mobile device not

595
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:43,159
the consumers and now you have binary

596
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,260
controls that automatically trust the

597
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,750
bearer of the credential with the

598
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,600
one-time password every binary control

599
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,870
can be defeated so are you creating

600
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,908
friction for the threat actor yes a

601
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,889
little bit you're also creating friction

602
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:00,350
for the consumer at the same time or we

603
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:01,879
are and we have a well-established track

604
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,110
record as security professionals for

605
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,169
doing just that however you've been

606
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,939
teaching a long time staff is it your

607
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,490
experience that people have an easier

608
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,980
time learning something or unlearning

609
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:22,620
some

610
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:27,900
thing so unlearning is hard isn't it

611
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:32,610
right unlearning is hard I have to ask

612
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:36,240
you to unlearn something do not assume

613
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,409
that authentication is a event with the

614
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,570
beginning and end and a binary outcome

615
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,270
assume authentication is a continuous

616
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:46,770
process it doesn't have a beginning or

617
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,559
an end and it's continuous and the

618
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:53,070
reason I'm asking you to do that and

619
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:55,918
unlearn the wisdom that was prevalent

620
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,370
for 60 years is because we'll never

621
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,760
solve authentication unless we think

622
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,168
differently about it and this is why

623
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,629
passwords and people don't get along

624
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:09,360
very well I mean I am a security

625
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,600
professional I have over a hundred maybe

626
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,610
I don't know a hundred and sixty

627
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,389
passwords for different sites and mobile

628
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:20,340
applications I use the same password

629
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,320
along amongst many different sites I

630
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,959
even have a password manager and I still

631
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,580
do it and I know all you are doing it as

632
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,990
well and I know that because the

633
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,418
criminals know that because they started

634
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,540
harvesting credentials five years ago

635
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:36,660
and now they have billions billions of

636
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,490
credentials available today so they're

637
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,840
doing something called credential

638
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:44,730
stuffing I hate when that happens I push

639
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,559
the wrong button this was an operator

640
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,270
error by the way this wasn't because I

641
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,270
was actually told not to do this

642
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:01,590
a little bit better and so we came up

643
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,260
with a new authentication capability

644
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,679
based on this notion of continuous

645
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,870
authentication and the interesting thing

646
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,390
is it doesn't add friction to the end

647
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:17,280
user it actually removes friction

648
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:18,780
because it eliminates passwords and if

649
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,020
you eliminate passwords you also

650
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,080
eliminate costs of password reset so it

651
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,690
actually saves money implementing this

652
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,970
capability so let me get this right it

653
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,520
removes friction from the end user and

654
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,840
it saves money and oh there's better

655
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,580
security what's not to like come on show

656
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,620
me the fine print here there's got to be

657
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,439
something in there that's bad well

658
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,790
here's what it does it takes behavioral

659
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,320
attributes now there's a fundamental

660
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,510
principle that you have to kind of

661
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,310
subscribe to behavior doesn't lie that's

662
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,890
what we believe

663
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:55,110
behavior doesn't lie and we're applying

664
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,410
that here by saying if you have a mobile

665
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:01,649
device or a web app what we're gonna do

666
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:04,170
is we're gonna capture attributes about

667
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,810
your use of the device and how the

668
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,700
device is configured and we're going to

669
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:12,210
take those attributes and turn them into

670
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,880
a mathematical representation of the

671
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:18,630
attribute data and we're going to

672
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,770
compare that in real time to an

673
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:26,040
established pattern so we do that with

674
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:29,900
30 to 60 of these and then we take the

675
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:32,370
30 or 60 scores deviation scores

676
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:36,000
comparing the pattern against real time

677
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:39,090
we turn that into one risk number and we

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,820
feed that risk number to the app and the

679
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:44,100
app decides how much access to provide

680
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,429
you in real time based on what that

681
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,760
number is and the reason the risk engine

682
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,530
creates just one number is for different

683
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,020
apps they have different thresholds of

684
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:58,350
what you want in terms of privacy or

685
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:01,050
security so you can modulate that with

686
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,530
the same risk number and we've

687
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:07,980
implemented this across all mobile and

688
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:12,030
web applications that face the consumer

689
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:14,850
and it's in use today now we did two

690
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:19,980
things that aren't necessarily relevant

691
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:23,059
on the slide here using a very important

692
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,669
tool in the design of this capability

693
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:31,770
the tool that we used here's the

694
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:35,220
punchline were our values and you see

695
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,389
our values that's not a tool but in this

696
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,429
case it was a vital design tool because

697
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:44,490
we're taking attributes of your use of

698
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:49,470
technology we're venturing into the

699
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:51,270
realm of the creepiness factor right so

700
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,760
if an enterprise is using your

701
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,160
behavioral attributes like maybe

702
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,010
attributes from your watch your eye

703
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,309
watch their feeding biometric

704
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,200
information into an a risk engine

705
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:07,020
potentially and let's say we're an

706
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,299
insurance company and we could use that

707
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,418
information to price our insurance

708
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:15,150
policies right now that's clearly in the

709
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,010
realm of creepiness right that's that's

710
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,640
big brother-type stuff we don't want

711
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:22,470
that right so we made two choices the

712
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,250
first choice is we decide only to use

713
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:29,130
benign attributes and I locked my chief

714
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,540
privacy officer in a room and I said

715
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,280
you're not allowed out of the room she

716
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,080
had her whole team in there until you

717
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,260
choose the attributes that are available

718
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,299
on this spreadsheet there was about 160

719
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,129
of them I said you have to choose the

720
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,740
ones that are benign that if they ever

721
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,720
got exposed in the internet they would

722
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,760
have any impact on a consumer an

723
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,350
individual and they went through and

724
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,240
they was tough to make an trade-offs

725
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,399
decision but they came out with about 60

726
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,370
attributes and those are the attributes

727
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,260
that we use the second decision we made

728
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:01,168
because we weren't going to store any

729
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,870
attribute information so if our risk

730
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:07,140
engine got hacked there's nothing in it

731
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:10,080
that can impact a consumer from a

732
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,570
privacy standpoint we turn every

733
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,819
attribute into a string of numbers and

734
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,800
we just compare two strings of numbers

735
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,350
together to get the risk deviation score

736
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,550
so if our risk engine was hacked

737
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:25,560
there's nothing in

738
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:27,120
that impacts now those two decisions had

739
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,418
nothing to do with anything except our

740
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:34,199
values because our values said we want

741
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,668
the consumer to trust the fact that

742
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,350
they're we're gonna protect their

743
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,319
information so we want to improve

744
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,339
security remove friction and we want

745
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,050
them to trust us

746
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,419
so that's why we made those decisions

747
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,179
there is no technical reason added

748
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,850
technology complexity to the project it

749
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,168
added time to the project but from our

750
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,739
standpoint is the right thing to do

751
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:58,230
does this sound futuristic no I'm glad

752
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,240
you said that there are four million

753
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,860
people using this today there'll be 40

754
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,069
million by the end of this year there'll

755
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:09,360
be 150 million in two and a half years

756
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:13,170
so this is not futuristic it is in

757
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,850
production today and getting back to

758
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,910
what we talked about in the panel in

759
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:20,910
terms of economics we are ratcheting

760
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,680
down our customer service calls for

761
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,190
password resets because there are no

762
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,549
passwords to reset and in any large

763
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,810
enterprise password resets a pretty high

764
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,690
pretty high call volume and percentage

765
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:36,390
of call volume so that's dropping so our

766
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,870
costs are going down and our consumer

767
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,330
experience is going way up no passwords

768
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:46,529
to remember now the other thing we did

769
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:50,210
is we we used a standard we adopted a

770
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:54,030
standard that basically says whatever

771
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:56,940
biometric you use on your phone so

772
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,950
you've chosen this phone this device and

773
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,680
you've chosen a biometric on there right

774
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,419
so whatever your choice is we're gonna

775
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,359
take that as one of the factors that

776
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,400
goes into the risk engine so you make

777
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,160
the choice you can if you're using an

778
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,990
iPhone you can do touch ID or face ID or

779
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,960
you can the combination of both that's

780
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:19,770
your choice whatever choice you make we

781
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,840
take into our risk engine following a

782
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,130
particular standard that allows us to do

783
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,870
that so you can make whatever choices

784
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,990
you want your carrier can make whatever

785
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,670
choices they want in terms of the

786
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,319
biometric on the device doesn't matter

787
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,060
that becomes part of your users

788
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,740
experience so once you

789
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,110
if you do touch ID once you put your

790
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,000
finger on the device you're into the app

791
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,070
there's nothing else you have to do

792
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,380
everything else that I've shown you is

793
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,210
in the background so that's the

794
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,030
advantage of having a positive user

795
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,580
experience and all of this is simply

796
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:56,590
because you're not the only one that has

797
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:59,290
your password so this is that technology

798
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:02,170
behind it and there's a number of

799
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,840
early-stage companies so if you don't

800
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,330
know the names of some of these

801
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,920
companies don't worry about it some of

802
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,200
the some of them are getting pretty big

803
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,960
but a lot of them are relatively small

804
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,410
and that ties to my philosophy of using

805
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,310
early-stage companies and I'll tell you

806
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,950
why and it comes down to economics which

807
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,810
is what we're talking about in the panel

808
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:29,350
of how economics and security are kind

809
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,740
of tied together let's say you're a

810
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:35,170
software manufacturer software

811
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:38,049
commercial software producer and your

812
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:42,490
software is sold to the enterprise to

813
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:46,420
the enterprise market the economics of

814
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:49,870
the software industry drive you to

815
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:54,070
allocate your scarce resource developers

816
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:57,279
and product managers to achieve the best

817
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,470
outcome and in this case sell to the

818
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,260
broadest part of the enterprise market

819
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,359
and if you can sell to the broadest part

820
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,720
of the market you're gonna be profitable

821
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:10,570
and that's true for every software

822
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,899
manufacturer if you look at security and

823
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,460
the enterprise security market and you

824
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,190
look at the broadest part of the

825
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:22,510
enterprise security market it's the

826
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:26,080
dumbest what that means is it's the

827
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,960
least sophisticated and so large

828
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,080
commercial software providers have to

829
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,880
based on the law of economics allocate

830
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,500
their scarce resource to serve the

831
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,770
broadest part of the market which is the

832
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:43,780
dumbest so if you want innovation in

833
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:47,770
unconventional controls in a common from

834
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,270
this part of the market it's it can't

835
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,970
it has to come from early-stage

836
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:55,180
companies which by the way early-stage

837
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,470
companies get bought by who large market

838
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,379
share leaders right because they know

839
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:01,149
the game right they're smart people it's

840
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,869
not that there are some not smart people

841
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,340
I'm not disparaging any large software

842
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:08,740
manufacturer I'm purely acknowledging

843
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,130
the economic laws of the jungle and I'm

844
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,500
choosing as a see so to work with

845
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,680
early-stage companies that will design

846
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,450
something based on my use case not a use

847
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,649
case to fit the broadest part of the

848
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:25,990
market and early-stage companies will

849
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,330
chase any use case because they don't

850
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,919
have any customers and so they're gonna

851
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:33,580
do what you want them to do and that's

852
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,640
where innovation comes from and look I'm

853
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:40,060
wrong sometimes like I chose bromium at

854
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,368
one time and you know that never paid

855
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,779
off but I'll tell you this I chose a lot

856
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,790
of other companies where I'm spending

857
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,990
nickels and dimes and getting a huge

858
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:53,170
return like these companies here that

859
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:55,629
are you know delivering so the reality

860
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:59,080
is I'm looking for a design partner to

861
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,690
design based on my use case and I don't

862
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,250
really care what happens after that if

863
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,680
they're successful a market god bless

864
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,270
them I'm happy for them but eventually

865
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,520
they're gonna get big and bit bought by

866
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:13,210
somebody I want to deal with that's just

867
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,770
the nature of the beast so they build a

868
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,109
use case then they build multiple use

869
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,420
cases and multiple use cases satisfies

870
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:22,210
the funnel again the broadest part of

871
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,560
the market they have to do this and if

872
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,940
they're good at what they do and treat

873
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,590
their shareholders correctly if they're

874
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,560
a public company they will do exactly

875
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:32,680
this and they have to and so that's not

876
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,630
necessarily what I want what I want is

877
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,589
something that has innovation so I'm

878
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,490
going to give you another example and

879
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,890
unconventional versus conventional

880
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,618
controls privileged user monitoring some

881
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,910
people call that insider threat call it

882
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:49,530
what you will

883
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:52,779
the best practice according to

884
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,720
conventional controls and or thread or

885
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,030
authoritative sources are when you grant

886
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,270
access to a system administrator or

887
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:06,550
domain administrator and

888
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:10,509
access manager a privileged user of any

889
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:14,200
kind what you should do is make sure

890
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,870
that an alert or a record goes to the

891
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,930
Sauk alerting them to the fact that

892
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:23,620
somebody has privilege and is using that

893
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:25,149
privilege this is conventional you know

894
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:29,740
conventional controls tell us to do this

895
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:32,680
okay that is the dumbest thing in the

896
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,279
world and the reason it's the dumbest

897
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,109
thing in the world

898
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:43,030
does anybody have a sock analyst that

899
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:44,650
has too little to do anyone anyone know

900
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,300
it's like sake analysts struggled to

901
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,850
keep up with the information that they

902
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,800
have right so you want to add more

903
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:54,360
information that's absolutely useless to

904
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,460
them so the auditors love this control

905
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:01,120
it's useless it wastes time and money

906
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,460
don't bother however if you took the

907
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,480
same information and shared it with the

908
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,850
boss of the privileged user who has

909
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,620
context who knows what should be done

910
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,509
how it should be done and when it should

911
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,100
be done

912
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:19,540
your boss their boss would know right

913
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:23,100
away if that's an anomaly because they

914
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:25,570
have the context for that so what we do

915
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,940
what we've done is we've planted a large

916
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:30,790
data lake and it's like you be a

917
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,810
capability we did a lot of the

918
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,310
development because it was an early

919
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,509
stage company this about three or four

920
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,980
years ago but there are a lot of

921
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:40,600
products today that are a lot more

922
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:44,490
mature so you don't necessarily know all

923
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:47,770
this information into this data Lake and

924
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:50,319
we got identity account entitlement

925
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:53,740
roles and then log activity physical

926
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,430
access DLP alerts we took a net by the

927
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,560
way every registered user of our network

928
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,359
has a profile that's a risk profile

929
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,240
based on all this attribute information

930
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:08,170
so we took physical access we took web

931
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,899
browsing we took email plus the

932
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:13,960
entitlements for everybody everything

933
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,800
that they're entitled to and how they

934
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,210
use what

935
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,040
their behavior is of using the

936
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,110
entitlements all that factors into a

937
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,540
risk score and every single registered

938
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:25,540
user has a risk score when they become a

939
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:32,529
privileged user we apply the risk score

940
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:34,840
and when we see data or an anomaly when

941
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:39,220
there have privileged we send this email

942
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:41,440
to their boss and it doesn't take a

943
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,910
rocket science to figure scientist to

944
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,100
figure out that you know Green is good

945
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,470
and red is bad right so you've you click

946
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,630
on one of the other if what the person

947
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,000
is doing is legitimate you click on

948
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,790
green it goes into updating the model

949
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,800
and then that's not alerted on in the

950
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,480
future if it's red their privileges

951
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,400
revoked automatically there's

952
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,560
orchestration to initiate a security

953
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,150
incident and so all they have to do is

954
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,009
read their email and choose one or the

955
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,770
other and they're the subject matter

956
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,600
expert that has the context so you've

957
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,420
got you know privileged user monitoring

958
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,950
based on this now if there's three it's

959
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:18,610
generally somewhere between two and

960
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:22,629
three anomalistic events for the

961
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:26,500
privileged user in real time the model

962
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:30,280
decides to revoke privilege immediately

963
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,470
and initiate a security incident where

964
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,880
there's orchestration there's no human

965
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:38,140
involvement at all why is this important

966
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,210
some companies that got hit with not

967
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,609
petya had fifteen thousand servers

968
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:46,060
knocked over and bricked in ninety

969
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:48,550
seconds there's no human than on the

970
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,700
planet that can operate that quickly so

971
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:54,670
the model is actually doing this for us

972
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,759
and the model here is a machine learning

973
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:00,670
unsupervised machine learning algorithm

974
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,040
that's running today we have over 400

975
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:06,430
machine learning models running in

976
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,330
production on nine platforms in the

977
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:14,560
enterprise and what's happening is that

978
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:16,810
I thought this has shows how much I know

979
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,560
but I thought when I hired four years

980
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:23,170
ago a chief data scientists to be

981
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,640
dedicated to security I thought he'd be

982
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,710
helping me with all these great tools

983
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,720
that I had and taking all the log data

984
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,810
and making it into something

985
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,509
I could make actionable like decide on

986
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:37,900
doing different cyber hunting campaigns

987
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:40,150
so I can make better decisions so this

988
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,090
is what I thought and what turned out to

989
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:45,430
be the case over time is that we put

990
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:49,030
this capability in place and it ended up

991
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:50,950
driving frontline security controls to

992
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,560
where humans don't have to make any

993
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:56,200
decision it's making most of the

994
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,630
decisions for us and it's embedded in

995
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,598
the platforms and today you can buy this

996
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,970
or you can build this so you know it's

997
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,440
the whole basis is models where what a

998
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:09,609
models are just mathematical

999
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,280
representation of an event and it turns

1000
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:15,340
out that figuring out events in a

1001
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,280
pattern and determining whether another

1002
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,619
event is matching that pattern or not is

1003
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,410
pretty straightforward from a data

1004
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:25,840
science perspective so applying a

1005
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:28,270
machine learning algorithm to doing that

1006
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,150
routine over and over again actually has

1007
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:36,030
some direct applicability to cyber

1008
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:40,170
security however more sophisticated deep

1009
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:45,099
kind of neural net technology applied to

1010
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:48,550
identifying anomalies and malware not so

1011
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:50,859
much doesn't work that well and we

1012
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:54,040
struggle with that and it's a part of

1013
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:57,940
cybersecurity that frankly it's not

1014
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:00,910
practical but in the former it's highly

1015
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,609
practical highly scalable and that's

1016
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,609
what gives us the 400 machine learning

1017
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:10,029
models that we have in production today

1018
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:12,960
so we've developed we have maybe the 400

1019
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,920
maybe there's a 150 of them that we

1020
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,460
bespoke models that we developed

1021
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:22,089
ourselves with our data science team we

1022
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,560
bought products that have models built

1023
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,259
into them we're doing a lot of that in

1024
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,940
some cases in the UBA case they the

1025
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,849
vendor gives us the model we modify it

1026
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,740
we put it into our vironment the email

1027
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:35,619
that I was showing you earlier that's a

1028
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,830
model that the vendor produced and we

1029
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:41,589
modified and tuned and adjusted in our

1030
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,308
environment so what's really happening

1031
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:47,259
here

1032
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:49,979
is that for students you've got to think

1033
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:54,069
about a by disciplinary approach here

1034
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:57,069
cybersecurity and data science to

1035
00:47:54,069 --> 00:48:00,609
whatever degree that you can master

1036
00:47:57,069 --> 00:48:02,558
capabilities in those two domains you

1037
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:04,449
will never ever have to worry about

1038
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,670
getting a job for the rest of your life

1039
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:08,680
and you'll be able to work wherever you

1040
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,949
want to work and you bet if I can make a

1041
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,038
lot of money so those two things if you

1042
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:17,439
can do those two things you're golden

1043
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,640
because what's happening is cyber

1044
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:22,209
security professionals and data

1045
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,219
scientists are coming together there's

1046
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:27,759
always a role for data science there's

1047
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:29,709
always a role for cyber security those

1048
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:33,009
two things aren't natural there's no

1049
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:34,719
natural affinity there we find data

1050
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:37,089
scientists and we teach them security

1051
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,400
that's not easier than finding data

1052
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:42,009
scientists with security expertise we

1053
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,209
have a mix of both but this is

1054
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:47,859
absolutely strategic to developing

1055
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:51,219
unconventional controls in a sustainable

1056
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:54,759
way to meet the needs of a resilient

1057
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:57,969
enterprise over time we've got some time

1058
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:59,380
for some questions I'm done with what

1059
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:07,470
I've shared with you I hope this was

1060
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:10,079
helpful and go ahead yeah

1061
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:12,359
okay so the incredibly interesting and

1062
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,650
fresh perspectives on security really

1063
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:18,058
appreciated that so I was listening very

1064
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,150
carefully to the last part especially

1065
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,740
where you said you you harvesting all

1066
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:27,270
this data about consumers and building

1067
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:31,200
building models and but there was a

1068
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:33,960
paper that I had referred to I was I

1069
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,939
guess the first speaker yesterday it was

1070
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,750
and you cannot use the AI in the

1071
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:42,900
traditional way to learn normal behavior

1072
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:45,960
and then you know detect deviation from

1073
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,579
normal behavior because learning

1074
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,160
algorithms required both normal and

1075
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:52,619
abnormal behavior and so where do you

1076
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,299
get the normal behavior the abnormal

1077
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,990
behavior from I mean it's just observing

1078
00:49:54,299 --> 00:50:00,809
the user well everything is normal

1079
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:02,520
so I think you may have some answers to

1080
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:04,859
that but I wanted to probe that a bit

1081
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:08,490
yeah so I don't look for normal behavior

1082
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:11,640
I look for a pattern so the models that

1083
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:14,250
we have purely determined whether actual

1084
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,470
behavior matches a pattern and to what

1085
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,270
degree it either and actually the way

1086
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,970
the model works it just tells us how

1087
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,799
much it doesn't match and it gives us a

1088
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,990
numerical representation of what it

1089
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:28,200
doesn't match and I can do a lot with

1090
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:31,109
that numeric representation so that's

1091
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:35,189
what we're doing and it actually models

1092
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:37,799
do that really well and so I've you know

1093
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:41,430
there are lots of cases where if I

1094
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:46,410
wanted to scan a database and find the

1095
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:48,660
color green versus the color fuchsia I'd

1096
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:51,649
struggle you know for a long time trying

1097
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:54,420
to do that but just trying to find

1098
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:58,130
patterns of behavior or behavior that

1099
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:04,250
match a pattern it's pretty easy to do

1100
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:07,380
okay thanks when I was a back in

1101
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,760
somewhere around 2005 my wife said to me

1102
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,670
I was living in Minnesota at the time

1103
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,819
anybody lived in Minnesota

1104
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:16,319
yeah yeah so I was living Minneapolis I

1105
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:20,579
was there and I loved it there so

1106
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,270
wonderful but my after three and a half

1107
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,340
winners

1108
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,960
our three winners three and half years

1109
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,100
my wife said to me at dinner look the

1110
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,830
kids and I are moving back east do you

1111
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:31,259
want to come and I said yeah yeah I

1112
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:34,160
think I do so I moved back east and the

1113
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,080
job I got was actually running data

1114
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,020
analytics for the marketing group of the

1115
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,869
US domestic car business for American

1116
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:45,509
Express now those models that we built

1117
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:47,700
back then they did they decayed so then

1118
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,890
we had 500 people just keeping models

1119
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,210
updated and they were conventional

1120
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,790
traditionals I didn't realize at the

1121
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:57,180
time but that was the foundation for my

1122
00:51:53,790 --> 00:52:00,000
security career so I owe my whole

1123
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,589
security career to my wife in Minnesota

1124
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,260
for that question

1125
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:07,020
yeah I just in your comments about

1126
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,460
vendor management when I was at Gartner

1127
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,610
we divided clients into three groups

1128
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,260
type a B and C with the Taipei's being

1129
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:16,680
folks like you were willing to go out on

1130
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,910
a leading edge what I want to supplement

1131
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,609
your advice by and I'd like your

1132
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,799
thoughts on this is that if you are type

1133
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,960
B or C consumer the dealing with

1134
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,060
startups can put a lot of stresses in

1135
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,190
unexpected places in your IT

1136
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:32,790
organization like the company may not be

1137
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:34,560
around the benefits could be they're

1138
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:36,000
going to give you a heck of a deal for

1139
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,020
being a reference but that means they're

1140
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,640
gonna be tracking their muddyfeet

1141
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,190
through your data center every couple of

1142
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,960
months when they get a client I'd like

1143
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,460
to see the fuller picture on how you see

1144
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,630
vendor management especially for folks

1145
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,550
who want to make that transition

1146
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,380
yeah William thank you for pointing that

1147
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:53,340
out you're absolutely right there's a

1148
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:56,280
lot of engineering overhead that I incur

1149
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,690
and a lot of the resources I use are

1150
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:02,010
actually embedded in the IT organization

1151
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:05,700
there was a report to security and I

1152
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:07,500
this wasn't an easy transition the first

1153
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,210
thing I did six years ago was I

1154
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,609
convinced procurement to change their

1155
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,080
criteria for evaluating vendors because

1156
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:16,950
when you evaluate a vendor for an

1157
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:21,480
enterprise software capability you want

1158
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:24,299
market size you want scalability you

1159
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,090
want client references you want

1160
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,890
financial resiliency you want all of

1161
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,070
those things which make perfect sense

1162
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:34,740
for cybersecurity early-stage companies

1163
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,069
none of those things apply so what I do

1164
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,788
is

1165
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:40,829
evaluate the co-founder and the

1166
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:43,049
co-founders technical ability to attract

1167
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:44,880
talent and the second thing I look at is

1168
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:47,279
whether they'll be willing to pivot and

1169
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,469
adjust and change and if those two

1170
00:53:47,279 --> 00:53:53,509
things are in place I'm good to go now

1171
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:56,969
the reality is I'm spending resource

1172
00:53:53,509 --> 00:54:00,180
engineering resource to make them

1173
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:02,309
successful so I'm not just letting them

1174
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,440
fail on their own I'm incubating their

1175
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:07,289
product development process based on my

1176
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,119
use case and I'm creating engineering

1177
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:11,759
resources that are helping them mature

1178
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,589
their product and that's the commitment

1179
00:54:11,759 --> 00:54:17,670
that's kind of the that you don't see

1180
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:20,190
that it's hard to get IT to buy into

1181
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,380
that to provide the resource to do that

1182
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,440
because what happens is you know for

1183
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,930
every proof of concept that we do with a

1184
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,759
early-stage company you know it's

1185
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:32,549
probably a 10 to 1 ratio of what we

1186
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:34,949
actually put into production 10 of them

1187
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:35,549
will fail for the one that we put into

1188
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:38,519
production

1189
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:41,009
so there's resource that we're putting

1190
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:42,629
into this that's not that you know it's

1191
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:44,670
not part of the equation necessarily

1192
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,549
that needs to be and so your point is

1193
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:50,130
absolutely valid this is not for

1194
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:53,130
everyone this is an acquired taste yeah

1195
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,619
yeah so thank you so much yeah I was

1196
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,479
absolutely struck by the same thing and

1197
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:59,849
my question actually has to do with IP

1198
00:54:57,479 --> 00:55:01,499
intellectual property if it's your use

1199
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:04,380
case you give it weight everybody never

1200
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:05,999
over is every answer I there's an

1201
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,529
investment arm and then they invest in

1202
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:11,129
some of the companies they've got to

1203
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:14,819
investments right now I everything that

1204
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:18,269
we developed I share with everyone

1205
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:21,119
because I was taught this you know early

1206
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:23,160
on the whole industry has to be

1207
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,289
resilient it's not just one company to

1208
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,660
protect all consumers and in healthcare

1209
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:30,479
we want to protect your health

1210
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,390
information regardless of what provider

1211
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:35,519
you're using and that means changing the

1212
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,469
entire industry and rising

1213
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,899
you know rising the level of resiliency

1214
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:41,969
across all companies so I give away

1215
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,130
everything that we do which is why I

1216
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:45,989
talk things like this so you go to the

1217
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,020
board and you say I don't care about IP

1218
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:49,300
No

1219
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:51,759
that I care about IP and developing IP

1220
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,010
for my use case to keep me gainfully

1221
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,890
employed that I really care about okay

1222
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,530
for commercializing it I we don't we

1223
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:00,730
give it away okay so your your agreement

1224
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,920
with the companies that you're bringing

1225
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,099
up to really I'll call it bring the

1226
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,200
cutting-edge tech is you own most of it

1227
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:11,440
and I own some of it we don't know any

1228
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,779
of it okay all right so in most cases

1229
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,420
the vendors own own it and they

1230
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,580
commercialize it we don't we don't I

1231
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,830
used to do patents years ago yeah

1232
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,990
patents are pain in the butt amen you

1233
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,759
know yes how many times patents are

1234
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,799
defended you got to show up in court now

1235
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,330
a subject matter expert and never get

1236
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,960
your name on a patent it's a dumbest

1237
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,259
thing in the world

1238
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,580
yeah I think yeah thank you so much just

1239
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,300
a couple other little quick ones so how

1240
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:41,859
many people are you in charge of five

1241
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:44,290
500 and then how many layers yeah about

1242
00:56:41,859 --> 00:56:45,640
six maybe five to six depending on some

1243
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:48,759
of the operational functions have more

1244
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,848
layers but yeah thank you so much thank

1245
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:55,390
you how we doing on time

1246
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:57,720
two more can I collect money for these

1247
00:56:55,390 --> 00:57:00,730
[Laughter]

1248
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:03,580
fascinating idea I'm wondering how long

1249
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:05,920
does it take to gather the information

1250
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,080
for the behavioral profile I'm thinking

1251
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,420
you hire someone in who's going to have

1252
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,700
well in military terms would be like top

1253
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,619
secret secure command information

1254
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,830
I assume you can't wait around for two

1255
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:18,369
years before they can get to that yeah

1256
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,680
thank you for asking that question

1257
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,810
that's a great question it's about two

1258
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,580
weeks in terms of behavior but it's

1259
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,799
dependent upon the frequency of the

1260
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,990
transactions and unfortunately in

1261
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,780
healthcare you guys don't go to the

1262
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,759
health plan website more than six times

1263
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,040
a year I've noticed you know and it's

1264
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,580
usually an open enrollment that's about

1265
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,980
it and so we actually create incentives

1266
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:45,339
to create more interaction with both

1267
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:47,290
mobile and web activity for explicitly

1268
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:49,960
this reason because we need more data to

1269
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:52,420
build the patterns but generally

1270
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,460
speaking it's about 10 business days

1271
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,880
that it takes us to have a model that

1272
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:59,850
we're highly confident in so in the mean

1273
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,000
time we actually give a pin

1274
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:06,060
but you know one time or not one time a

1275
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,520
pin that we give at registration and

1276
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:11,040
then they use the pin but most of them

1277
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:14,130
within the first day they use the

1278
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:17,940
biometric they just use that and so we

1279
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:21,090
rely on the biometric and a pin if they

1280
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:23,160
choose that during once they register

1281
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:25,650
for about the first couple of weeks and

1282
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,720
then the model kicks in after that and

1283
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,750
and does everything in the background so

1284
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,600
it's a good good question the identity

1285
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:37,590
proofing is the weakest part of this

1286
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:40,319
model and so we're looking at a couple

1287
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,210
of alternatives right now of taking a

1288
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,490
picture of your driver's license and a

1289
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:49,050
picture of yourself and mapping both and

1290
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:51,509
using that as a verification process for

1291
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:53,160
identity proofing so that's one option

1292
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:56,640
there's a couple of other options as

1293
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,069
well but trying to solve the identity

1294
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,589
proofing in registration problem is

1295
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:03,750
actually buying us the time to use the

1296
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:08,220
model so it's good real good question

1297
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:09,270
last question Jim okay you've got a

1298
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,520
whole bunch of really good and

1299
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:13,440
interesting unconventional controls but

1300
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,330
we also live in a world where there are

1301
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,820
a lot of people who are comfortable with

1302
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:19,440
the conventional yeah so how would you

1303
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,210
convince the auditors not to ding you

1304
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,350
how do you convince the board to allow

1305
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,030
you to go with this kind of approach

1306
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:26,270
yeah I'm glad you asked that question

1307
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:32,070
because and both have different answers

1308
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:34,080
so the auditors I teach it's something I

1309
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:38,490
learned in financial services if you

1310
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:42,630
teach regulators new advanced techniques

1311
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:44,759
they always go to you first and they

1312
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,920
never give you a hard time because

1313
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,480
they're there to learn the people that

1314
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,750
give the enterprises they give a hard

1315
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,400
time on are the ones after you because

1316
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,290
that's when they start to apply what

1317
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,840
you've taught them and that's when it

1318
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:00,509
gets a little bit more painful for the

1319
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,700
enterprise so I never have a problem now

1320
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:05,430
in this case we're using a lot of models

1321
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:08,609
as an example so there's a methodology

1322
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:10,770
called crisp it's not that you need to

1323
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:13,560
remember an acronym it's a methodology

1324
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:17,700
to prove the efficacy of

1325
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:20,730
a algorithm and it's what auditors have

1326
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,460
to be equipped with to determine whether

1327
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:25,770
these controls are effective or not you

1328
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,840
can run all a sample tests that you want

1329
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,570
at the end of the day you've got to test

1330
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,960
the efficacy of the model and so I teach

1331
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:35,820
auditors we have a class that teaches

1332
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,760
audit and our audit professionals I

1333
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,590
treat them like cousins like I some of

1334
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,810
our security people professionals go

1335
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:44,790
into audit and some come from audit into

1336
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:48,000
cyber security and we teach the same

1337
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:50,130
curriculum for for both there cuz

1338
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,080
they're kindred spirits if you will but

1339
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,920
you have we for an unconventional

1340
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,630
controls I have to teach now the board

1341
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,210
is a little bit different the board I

1342
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:06,060
have to teach them how to operate their

1343
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:08,040
iPhone I know it sounds crazy but you

1344
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:10,410
talk to them in terms that they can

1345
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,720
understand in their daily life and most

1346
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:15,839
board members are older than I am which

1347
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,419
means olders dirt right so they're not

1348
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,280
of the you know the generation uses

1349
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,100
technology so you have to do basic

1350
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:26,550
simple things like that and you have to

1351
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:29,160
show them that their personal liability

1352
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,230
is not at risk those are the two things

1353
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,170
that they primarily care about and look

1354
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:36,180
I have experience with some absolutely

1355
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,340
the best most wonderful people in the

1356
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,799
world that I've ever met have been part

1357
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,770
of my board at different times

1358
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,780
tremendous respect for them but I have

1359
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:47,490
to spoon-feed the information and in a

1360
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,230
way that they can understand it and

1361
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:51,149
that's fundamentally different than a

1362
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:53,310
regulator it's fundamentally different

1363
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:55,050
than an IT professional and it's it's

1364
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:57,690
different did that answer your question

1365
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:01,130
yes thank you Jim thank you I hope this

1366

1368
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:11,620
begin to close down our session I would

1369
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:15,370
be remiss if I didn't give a big

1370
