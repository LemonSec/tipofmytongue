1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
okay let's get started with the second

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,870
tech talk of the everyday and it's my

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,420
pleasure to introduce professor Ratigan

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,710
content is a yes assistant professor and

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,139
computer scientists here at Purdue

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,719
University he's kind of known to us as

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,099
our blockchain go-to guy so any topic

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,270
has to do with that subject we always

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,090
like to call get in on this so today his

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,160
talk is about GDP our privacy versus

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,140
watching transparency I'm having

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,130
intrigued to hear what this is going to

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,410
tell us so without further ado yeah so

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,149
how do we buddy can you hear me at the

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,429
back perfect okay so my name is anneka

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,489
today I work here in computer science

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,219
department and associate with Purdue

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,769
typically I work on applied cryptography

19
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:51,120
distributive systems and as it comes out

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,820
when the blockchain teams they were

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,530
right the topic that I would have liked

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,780
to work on and I'll continue to work on

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,480
that where I try to understand the

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,340
interplay between different applications

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,870
as well as security privacy for

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,060
cryptocurrencies and rock chain

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,070
technology as one of my key things I

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,380
also continue to work on metadata

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,679
protection and other privacy issues in

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,390
general by by applying the knowledge

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,180
from applied cryptography in distributed

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,100
systems but as I'm focusing from the

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,380
title I'll be talking about things that

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,710
I like to do what I'm doing regarding

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,470
blockchain C so our little bit

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,158
information from my side I been doing

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,329
quite a few blockchain projects on

38
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,759
asking different kind of questions and

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,610
try to see how they're fits in academia

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,350
and industry where me and my 70

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,479
insurance and few other undergrad we're

42
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,839
trying to do projects for some blocked

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,360
in startups some industrial

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,009
collaboration that I have or had

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,850
regarding block chains or in general so

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,710
in general

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,158
NSM where we are trying to do some

48
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:00,009
interesting stuff these days so yeah

49
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,350
coming starting to talk about the blocks

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,020
in general I try to first associate them

51
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:08,199
with this changing landscape of

52
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,260
communication where one skin keating

53
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,980
which I saw starting from my days is

54
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,780
maybe in 2000 after dot-com boom the loo

55
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,850
business they started to become what we

56
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,890
can call it global so that rather than

57
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,400
having one local services for individual

58
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,440
aspects like taxi finding hotels buying

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,959
stock we started our global services

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,420
such as uber and Airbnb never saw on an

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,130
eBay where we have one unique interface

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,920
that is applicable all over the world

63
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,590
and anywhere I go I know that app cannot

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,929
that application web browser can help me

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,080
to go there where all of them wish to

66
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,090
centralize is the sense that they were

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,510
decisions how they operate army

68
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,060
centrally and in a bio board or some

69
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,250
kind of a cup the typical how the

70
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,030
companies can make profit in general and

71
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,799
in terms of the payment space maybe 2008

72
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,470
onwards after a bit emergence of it

73
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:05,320
count because they that can we make the

74
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,799
governance distributed by that I mean

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,180
making the rules and falling through and

76
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,840
initially came in form of Bitcoin and

77
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,209
several such cryptocurrencies and then

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,430
so more elaborate cut pro concern or

79
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,670
interpretation material but eventually

80
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,360
even industry saw that the core concept

81
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,880
has value for us and in fact we don't

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,370
need to average take this to finance or

83
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,410
payments but if anything any asset that

84
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,010
we wish to track could be track you in

85
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,500
this system and it's a very good tool

86
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,578
mechanism to achieve proven instability

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,560
for supply chains in general since when

88
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,600
people are in fact trying to employ a

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,920
blockchain for everything and I cancer

90
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,170
listen it's not panacea easily 2/3 of

91
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,390
the current blockchain

92
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,369
projects me recently do not determine

93
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:02,119
that hey this is not good enough or not

94
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:06,650
fast enough for use and maybe another

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,150
another one six of them may even find

96
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,400
out to me in C there were four other

97
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,239
reason including regulation but indeed

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,040
there are

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,780
the concept is here to stay and there

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,599
are easily we are going to see

101
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,389
significant number of use cases where

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,470
this will get used for several years or

103
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:26,180
for in the decades in general for me

104
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,220
when I look at block chains I try to

105
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,840
associate that with four key parts the

106
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,300
first thing is obviously the blockchain

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,729
or I'll put that more like an asset

108
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,130
database that aggregate transactions

109
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:40,280
into blocks so that these blocks are

110
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,110
added to the existing chain in an

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,888
append-only fashion so it's important

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,120
word there is asset I'm not saying

113
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,930
transactions or payments I'm saying

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,479
anything that can be ID'd can a can be

115
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,630
or where we are concerned about its

116
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,760
movement from participant to participant

117
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,039
can be tracked through such database and

118
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,990
that's a key thinking that an important

119
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,090
thing for this database it should be

120
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,620
appended Lee so that the order of the

121
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,479
things should not change it's important

122
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,860
that if orders are changed that

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,889
something which is valid will be will

124
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,199
become invalid tomorrow then you also

125
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,599
want to make sure that it's information

126
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
is available to the participants who one

127
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,199
should have access to this information

128
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,840
and that's it the replication is an

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,419
important aspect you also to make sure

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,869
that only legitimate participants can

131
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,490
perform transactions or make actions in

132
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,729
a particular fashion so there you have

133
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:37,400
to make sure that we can verify them and

134
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:40,070
apply appropriate access control as well

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,049
as in the form of how the transactions

136
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,930
occur and for that reason we have to

137
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,909
employ public infrastructure or in some

138
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,150
cases a single digital signature to

139
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:52,389
ensure that ensure that only legitimate

140
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,599
actions can happen in two systems and

141
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:59,689
once it means such a system we want to

142
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:01,699
make sure that there is no way you need

143
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,279
can actually perform two conflicting

144
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,319
actions and for that you required

145
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,929
concerns as mechanism and once these

146
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,329
things are in place you can not only

147
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:13,878
make you to use this as the storage of

148
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,829
information but in fact also as a

149
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,289
mechana where you can perform computing

150
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:20,839
on this function and perform a lot of

151
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,969
different tasks which are called smart

152
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,069
contracts in general so that it's not

153
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:27,110
only becomes the storage but also an

154
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:30,289
execution engine where data is not only

155
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,849
store but execute in terms of the

156
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,489
applications I don't need to say there

157
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,539
are a Bitcoin terraeum rep and all sort

158
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:38,268
of different financial world

159
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,938
applications merging information less

160
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,860
sitting at the core public setting are

161
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:46,009
also in more permission or more

162
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,979
consulship requirement but more

163
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,779
interestingly or may become even bigger

164
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,539
industry where it could be employed is

165
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:56,360
indeed supply chain industry where there

166
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,549
are interesting applications and systems

167
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,339
are emerging for talking something like

168
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:04,998
softer - even something like time and

169
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:07,039
see basically anything any I said that

170
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:09,050
could be ID'd could be managed through

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,300
this environment and our focus today

172
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,769
will be exactly associate with these the

173
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:18,619
assistants so when we talk about supply

174
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,599
chain and where projects are useful the

175
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:24,259
key thing there comes in mind is -

176
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,909
counterfeits how can we take the

177
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,269
counterfeit or anything wrong that's

178
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:31,699
happening to system and they take that

179
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:35,239
faster and efficiently in terms of the

180
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:37,849
cost as well as the time it takes in

181
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:40,099
general so when we look at traditional

182
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:42,139
supply chain we typically consider them

183
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,149
to be multiple bilateral links that are

184
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,339
joined together to form a chain but

185
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,749
important aspect is that although they

186
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,149
are bilateral links they are not

187
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,369
transparent across ballot Ori so you

188
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,619
will know who that their relation with

189
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:56,029
be but have no clue what's the

190
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:58,279
relationship or how the transition

191
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,929
happened for me to see when something

192
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,629
wrong happens they have to rely on

193
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:03,780
actually ability making them provide

194
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,580
their information and

195
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,349
when that information make him lead or

196
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,630
may not ever come and that's really the

197
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,660
tracking is a very hard problem or that

198
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,340
information when it comes it comes in a

199
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,389
fashion so that is modified to reduce

200
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,950
the blame on those parties so and these

201
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,720
these kind of things can be directly

202
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,599
associated event let's say we come

203
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,730
across a counterfeit or can be either

204
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,380
prevented or let's say we if we cannot

205
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,690
prevent it can be detect who actually

206
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:35,039
introduced those product or component in

207
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,260
usage so if we can do that efficiently

208
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,960
in terms of if we can if I come across

209
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,750
counterfeit product or any anything

210
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,070
maybe let's say path let me switch

211
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,550
probably want to return mind where it's

212
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,280
coming from

213
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,870
if you can find out that efficiently in

214
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,699
the sense that in matter of seconds

215
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,800
rather than a matter of days or weeks

216
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,390
there's the significant cost benefit

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,699
that it can bring and that's a key

218
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,260
advantage I find that anything that

219
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,790
anything anything that you were to track

220
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,980
and find out when it's coming from if

221
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,439
you can find out that efficiently then

222
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,710
we can indeed saw significant problems

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,620
in there already been examples of

224
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,240
compliance ID techniques such as RFID

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,020
tags and puffs which are present there

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,370
but as I already mentioned that's a good

227
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,910
that's certainly an advantage thing but

228
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,620
it does not stop insider so the

229
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,630
participants of the supply chain to

230
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,120
actually introduce fake encounter rates

231
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,750
in general and in general are recorded

232
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,490
we cannot stop the in more in academic

233
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,200
terms we cannot stop equivocation from

234
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,320
the legitimate but militia supply chain

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,210
clear and that's where the key place

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,460
where blockchain comes together because

237
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,600
it brings it link those different

238
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,390
bilateral links they are joining

239
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,960
together to form one in one source of

240
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,140
information that cannot be that cannot

241
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,910
be changing later and that's where the

242
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,600
key advantage of the block existence of

243
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,819
things so as an example I am going to

244
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,750
how it can do I am going to take a

245
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,700
project that I am working in the

246
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,100
automotive service environment it's a

247
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,620
part of

248
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,630
it's part of the fourth particular

249
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,940
answer I'm trying to understand there

250
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:16,040
how can what all kind of system that we

251
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,440
can introduce into increasing supply

252
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,469
chain for let's say in auto body parts

253
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,810
and how can then that help to detect

254
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,510
counterfeit if they get introduced or

255
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,859
even how can they be helpful towards I

256
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,960
fish antique call for action such as

257
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,510
recalled for different components or or

258
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,660
making sure that nobody introduces wrong

259
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,310
components things and so here we just

260
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,329
took a simple example of our being us

261
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,130
very I say a simplified version of the

262
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,750
supply chain where we assume there's

263
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,170
some supplier who creates a legitimate

264
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,180
part and they go through manufacturer

265
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,099
OEM says they call into the into the

266
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,050
automotive industry then to a dealer and

267
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,030
a final to officially repair shop and

268
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:02,300
finally that component I rent to a

269
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,740
existing car and kind of a provenance we

270
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,219
are looking for that if that component

271
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,930
is right then the car will show no we

272
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,610
love showing support but if that company

273
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,800
is wrong the car itself will tell you

274
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,880
that okay you added a couple hundred

275
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,579
that's the wrong car okay and the by

276
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,380
Roget means that it's either an ID which

277
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,560
is copied from a legitimate component

278
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,910
added to a counterfeit or component

279
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,910
which is not from the system it just

280
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,430
added from some other shop or some other

281
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,150
provider which may not be part of the

282
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,550
digitals

283
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,760
at the same time if a legitimate

284
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,099
component is taking another parcel

285
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,260
supplied to some other reseller and from

286
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,300
the lavash up to the car

287
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,550
if it is the right component then may be

288
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,439
fine to add it but it will be still good

289
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:54,410
if somehow the the the the OEM or

290
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,940
manufacture can keep track of happening

291
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,980
of such things because they it could be

292
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,050
beneficial for them to keep track of

293
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,380
these things so that they can stop such

294
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,630
thing from happening so the translation

295
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,150
that one can think of that we worked on

296
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,139
for this project was based on hyper

297
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,319
ledger where the basic idea for ecology

298
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,989
that we take this basically blockchain

299
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:19,420
environment into two parts one is the

300
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,339
endorsing parts or the guys who keep the

301
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,839
blockchain and the other part is

302
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,420
ordering service which could be

303
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,549
outsourced whose key task is to only to

304
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,290
take the transaction in order them for

305
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,379
performances we go

306
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,358
so the typical idea for such environment

307
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,579
will be when or any such transaction to

308
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,739
add a component or to transfer it from

309
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,019
one player to other is added it is sent

310
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:43,059
to appropriate endorsing nodes which

311
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,799
will have business logic incorporated in

312
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,259
those nodes to execute such a

313
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,839
transaction and those transactions if

314
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,759
they're correct and are as correct

315
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,799
according to the current state of the

316
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,899
blockchain that they'll be accepted and

317
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,689
sent back to the client who then sent

318
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:01,480
them to the ordering service and then

319
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:04,809
already correct such a few transaction

320
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,160
for any ordering period and this service

321
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,809
could be an individual node or

322
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,269
distribute it and then once they have

323
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:12,459
done with the consensus this info those

324
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,220
order transactions sent back to the

325
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,138
blockchain where it could happen that it

326
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,600
could strap and if some transitions are

327
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,850
ordered differently aside that some of

328
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
them can become invalid because the

329
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,989
reader right priorities that they have

330
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,970
accordingly or some of them could be

331
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,199
invalidated but eventually a valid set

332
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,720
of transactions are added to the

333
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,258
blockchain and are available to all the

334
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,679
interesting peers in exact you know

335
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,299
fashion so that all of them all of those

336
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,679
who are functioning correctly will have

337
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,769
those transaction in the exact same

338
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,889
order so in our situation the idea will

339
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,079
be each of those nodes we saw on the

340
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:52,209
previous slide will introduce their own

341
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,910
have their own endorsing peers and

342
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,219
appropriate transactions will typically

343
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,499
associated with them for example let's

344
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,839
say a particular auto component is going

345
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,850
from supplier manufacturer then it has

346
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,129
to be validated by an industry PA

347
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,749
offered by a manufacturer and as well as

348
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,269
the supplier so that it's not possible

349
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:13,529
for any of them to trick and introduce

350
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:16,359
fake components are wrong information

351
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,369
the important thing is that for such a

352
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:20,559
system is that let's say now we talk

353
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,270
about this dealer that guy has nothing

354
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,829
to do we

355
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,370
a transition that is happening with with

356
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,350
supplier and the manufacturer in that

357
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,670
case such as Martha she will not goes to

358
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,340
this dealer for example let's say this

359
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,349
endorsing pa3 he's the dealer and they

360
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,730
will not dozen they will not have

361
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,770
business logic how to proceed this

362
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,710
transaction and will not also know that

363
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,530
so that's it in this execute and order

364
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,540
and then validated process allows them

365
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,069
to connect information so that they can

366
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,050
also become a third party in terms of

367
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,290
concept but at the same time they don't

368
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,390
need to execute the digger transaction

369
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,709
so this validation should be performed

370
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,400
by relation but they do not actually

371
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,140
perform the execution of the transaction

372
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,090
that's the core idea which makes this

373
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,490
approach interesting in terms of making

374
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,560
sure that we have nice access control at

375
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,890
the same time allowed to have the

376
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,069
information available so what kind of

377
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:16,410
issues that one can see so it's this

378
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:19,200
pool hyper line a base system has

379
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,610
probably a nice bootstrapping mechanism

380
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,960
and there are all sort of different

381
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,210
project that are emerging in the

382
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,650
industry for example that I've given

383
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,090
massive working on to get a blockchain

384
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,189
how bitch works across the different

385
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,080
shipping environment walmart has

386
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,330
something going on in similar say so is

387
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,100
Krueger and also systems but the key

388
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,620
thing that is emerging in this case is

389
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,260
what is gonna I P problem which

390
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,510
basically just asks that who runs this

391
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,640
endorsing peers the guys who run this

392
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,680
embassy Pierre had access to the

393
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,180
information while if you do not run I

394
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,160
endo sig Pierre you do not have a

395
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,560
suitable information so the question is

396
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,930
that who all runs this are peers and

397
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,790
that becomes so challenge in my example

398
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,160
I mentioned everybody Cameron is clear

399
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,610
but in fact that could be a challenge in

400
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,949
general in many scenarios and and that

401
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,800
brings us to in general what kind of

402
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,510
issue that we will deal with Ensenada so

403
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,420
the first thing is what we can call an

404
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,470
IP prediction or access control and

405
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,140
another important thing is are

406
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,490
symmetrical so we I like to focus in

407
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,149
this talk regarding access

408
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,709
bring that to them GDP oranges so here's

409
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,680
the example I'm showing as I already

410
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:30,329
mentioned that we will make sure that in

411
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,550
our example let's say we are saying a

412
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,190
dear bath then only a supplier can

413
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,870
provide an air bag and add that in the

414
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,490
system so it's only available to supply

415
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,860
it's not even available to one

416
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,870
manufacturer as I'm sure you hear - or

417
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,430
any other party similarly when you're

418
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,380
transferring air bag it could be

419
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,099
applicable to two appropriate parties

420
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:53,010
which are present in such a system so

421
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:56,190
but then when we want to have an area

422
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,200
where let's say we consider their supply

423
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,390
OEM and in here and then going to this

424
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,660
that information going to the car in

425
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,400
general what we do here that we are we

426
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,770
added three different and recipients for

427
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,589
each of them but let's say in our

428
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,209
traditions in our typical scenario there

429
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,879
won't be one supplier or there won't be

430
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,730
100 but there could be different such

431
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,170
players which are present happen where

432
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,089
there could easily hundreds of suppliers

433
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,860
there could be tiers of those or even

434
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,819
types of dealers every dealers all over

435
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,740
and the question is that how can what is

436
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,770
the latina what's the infrastructure

437
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,710
that we can provide for such inducing

438
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,270
the simplest solution is that each of

439
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,910
those entities also introduce their own

440
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,010
node into the system and now any

441
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,020
transaction that involves them in a

442
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,750
traditional supply chain appropriately

443
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,850
we need to add a component for those

444
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,679
however challenge will be that it may

445
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,580
not be always policy but for small

446
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,920
dealers - or suppliers or or any such

447
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,590
tier - supplier for such small entities

448
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,540
to introduce a node into system or maybe

449
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,699
some of the big players find that to be

450
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,620
continuity in general that the hold

451
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,929
option is available to such small

452
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,020
entities so that introduced interesting

453
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:12,179
challenge that how can we tolerate and

454
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,070
introduce such small-scale players or

455
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,950
large number of players in system

456
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,939
without introducing no for each of those

457
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,240
into

458
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,860
into achieve and if we do not add into

459
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,710
node to change they will be worried

460
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,530
about IP or the protection for their own

461
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,570
information or who is taking decision on

462
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,960
behalf of them on other hand if we

463
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:36,270
introduce node for each of them it could

464
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,610
become a challenge in general in terms

465
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,379
of this capability of the system so

466
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,500
that's certainly something that is

467
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,460
inefficient in this environment it's

468
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,940
also related to the typical gdpr issues

469
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,120
in this space so for some of you who

470
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,190
haven't heard about this also in Europe

471
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,899
they have been working to have a new

472
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,080
data protection regulation for several

473
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,540
years and the the the plan I think got

474
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,879
final pass in 2016 with a lot of

475
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,240
negotiation between privacy advocates as

476
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,700
well as between the different inertial

477
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,060
fears that what looks to be a good

478
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,490
measure that we can introduce to the

479
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,620
friend of user data is collected by the

480
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,800
industry and how can we keep make sure

481
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,810
that users privacy is protected into

482
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,649
these scenarios while at the same time

483
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:32,149
ensuring that the businesses dangerous

484
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,830
that is associated with that business

485
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:38,630
from the data are also protected

486
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,710
simultaneously from there are several

487
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,590
basic principles that are associated

488
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,860
with this but for us the two key thing

489
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,800
that is associated in this environment

490
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:53,459
is one is the accuracy so you want to

491
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,639
make sure in this environment that if T

492
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,910
that is added to added or that is taken

493
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,070
for B or the individual or any any

494
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,460
organization for a company and it is

495
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,860
added on my behalf into a particular

496
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,810
data that is collected by englishy and

497
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,860
if it is wrong then it should be

498
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,330
possible for me to correct it okay and

499
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,010
another thing if the storage limitation

500
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,889
where you want to make sure that a

501
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,320
particular entry when it is added for my

502
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,230
entries added in such a system that

503
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,200
eventually it is removed

504
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,860
the system when the use of that is or or

505
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,809
maybe when a particular time that is

506
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,729
already decided for that let's see one

507
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,220
year or two year that's over and after

508
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,820
time out know that information should no

509
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,179
longer be available to them and as it

510
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,700
turns out those are principle indeed may

511
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,620
look I think they are going against the

512
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,320
blockchain concept in general because

513
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,110
the first thing is that there are other

514
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,090
animation that it's assumed to be an

515
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,370
immutable structure so that you can see

516
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,039
add something to blockchain nobody can

517
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,139
change it okay and on the other hand

518
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,240
it's also the structure one saying some

519
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:07,309
informations a very is added to the

520
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,260
blockchain now you cannot remove that

521
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,690
again for changing either so difficult

522
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,549
or not possible and removing it also not

523
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,610
possible so that's a impression in

524
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:18,470
general people god and it there is there

525
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,029
was indeed that into the impression I

526
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,250
come across when I talk to people

527
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,779
industries that when they want to act

528
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,940
invade they look at GDP or and

529
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:30,620
blockchain they find those concept to be

530
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,809
opposite of each other and because many

531
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,699
of the organisation that we have and I

532
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,309
guess some of you will agree with me

533
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,590
that depends they have presence all over

534
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,990
the world including Europe when they

535
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,789
want to roll out a solution and if they

536
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,559
cannot incorporate that solution into

537
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,629
the business that assumes a Europe in

538
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,580
general because of the system that

539
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,559
solution just probably cannot work I

540
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,000
mean if you have a supply chain and some

541
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,830
of that part goes through that's a

542
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,289
Europe and all of sudden you cannot add

543
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,299
any entries in that field scenario now a

544
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:01,399
resident a very lacking for lack of

545
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:03,470
information which will result in two

546
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:05,600
significant issues in terms of any

547
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,470
usefulness that we can get from such a

548
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,059
logical so that's the reason it's very

549
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,799
interesting to consider the interplay

550
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,918
between these two MB I'm going to spend

551
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,679
a few few minutes of my talk well last

552
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,289
time it's a focusing on those office so

553
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,409
we can actually look at those concept

554
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,240
into three key rights that are typically

555
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,510
associated

556
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,419
with the GDP our right to integer right

557
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,669
to ratification and right to object to

558
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,770
the processing so right to originally

559
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,080
exactly the first the second one that I

560
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,289
mentioned is that if something is added

561
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,330
where it's my T times collected by a and

562
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:44,860
they called as collector here basically

563
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,799
those n dosing peers are going to become

564
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,500
collector now it should because it's my

565
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,260
right to actually remove this data for

566
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,270
after a party for a particular reason

567
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,450
okay it could be just basic time out or

568
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,789
maybe if I get coat or or something like

569
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,130
that or some other reason which is

570
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:06,429
defined by regulation I should be able

571
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,830
to remove this information the second is

572
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,710
right to ratification or defecation

573
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,480
where the I am is that than some coming

574
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,149
information which is present there it is

575
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,880
wrong or should be changed then it

576
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:20,739
should be possible to change that info

577
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,500
okay and the third thing is right to

578
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,200
object to processing where maybe you

579
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,640
associate that for a particular use that

580
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,279
you find your information should not be

581
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,500
use then you have right that year you

582
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,870
can specify that and your information is

583
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,929
not employed for that purpose for our

584
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,428
discussion when somewhere when because

585
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,350
we are not happy with individual user

586
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:44,440
but we are talking about our typically

587
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,658
small organization small or a scale and

588
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,980
because the art part of the supply chain

589
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,799
system and this is the traceability

590
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,330
mechanism in most typical scenarios we

591
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,820
only focus on right to enrich and

592
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,158
identification right objects maybe he is

593
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,080
already CUNY because you got yourself

594
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,080
also want to become part of the

595
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,580
traceability system so at least our it

596
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,250
could be inherently employed into

597
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,990
environment but I think the to the focus

598
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,240
in this environment is typically

599
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,669
associate and outer right to

600
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,779
ratification and the challenge is that

601
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:18,429
how can we incorporate and introduce

602
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,980
changes to the blockchain is viable to

603
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:23,169
work with so the first thing is if we

604
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,630
work with something honest public block

605
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,929
changes are what typically should make

606
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,149
example is such as Bitcoin right here

607
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:34,179
it's all at least in current form it's

608
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:35,590
not possible at all if as we say once

609
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,330
information is there

610
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,668
cannot be change and it's certainly

611
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,199
something which it is not possible

612
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,299
Whitaker the way they're currently

613
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,850
brought but that doesn't mean that we

614
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:51,340
cannot change those system to make it

615
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:53,620
work or if if we define Bitcoin were a

616
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,360
private version of Bitcoin or private

617
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,979
orogeny theorem indeed they could be

618
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,139
modified to work with this decision and

619
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,090
what we are going to see is four key

620
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,520
issues that I find by going through

621
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,980
these systems and how we can work with

622
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,760
how can we introduce cryptic solutions

623
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,460
to overcome those issues so the first

624
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,408
issue that typically associated a state

625
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,510
that I come across is one which is

626
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:21,669
associated is appropriate safeguards for

627
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,770
the transfer outside leave when this

628
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:26,890
information from Europe enumerate which

629
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:29,830
is transferred from one subsidiaries in

630
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,059
you you to let's say US or elsewhere how

631
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,820
to make sure that that information

632
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,590
safeguarding that sinner okay in public

633
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,830
blockchain it will be a tough challenge

634
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,809
because there are no me out then there

635
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,210
may not be legal boundaries that are

636
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,240
well defined but at least for permission

637
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,039
proxy and scenarios in general no even

638
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,260
BC contractual clauses and corporate

639
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:52,120
rules could be employed and excused

640
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,549
there however we find that even

641
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,479
cryptographer reach and such as

642
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,700
encrypting or committing to this

643
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,029
information could be employed where the

644
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,940
idea will be that of the data will

645
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:06,610
reside in general on all the all the

646
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,850
associated peers however the way to

647
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,908
encrypt it our way to actually unwind

648
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,949
because that typically may not be always

649
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:17,640
available to every participant so

650
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:20,289
although data may be available outside

651
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,809
but in a fashion so that they cannot see

652
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:26,590
what what's actually their values which

653
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:28,270
are present in this in another issue is

654
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,070
that a blockchain can contain personal

655
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,879
data and personal data cannot be stored

656
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,408
for unlimited time so the idea that we

657
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,080
just similar as we saw with the

658
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:41,320
encryption or here is that you will

659
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,770
never store to work to make it for the

660
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,840
the solutions that are

661
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,930
villager or other solutions could be

662
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,639
modified so that we never store the

663
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,230
information in print it's but it's

664
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,300
always told music reprocessing

665
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:58,580
commitments or committing encryptions

666
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,260
such that now okay the thing is that the

667
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,460
data will go out be there in this

668
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,710
particular fashion but the way to

669
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,420
actually agree be completely the key

670
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,980
that is required for encryption or the

671
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,530
randomness that is associated with

672
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,240
commitments can be destroyed with the

673
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,310
exact same rules that companies are

674
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,310
already employing towards make it work

675
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,230
in the central city and now among those

676
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:22,220
two major cerebellum is possible make

677
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:24,170
it's possible to make sure that for the

678
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,940
time duration or time or that is

679
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,820
specified one of those keys or those

680
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,970
values are removed that it's no longer

681
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,450
could be accessible through through this

682
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,540
mechanical ah-1 if we refer that to make

683
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,730
it work in a fashion when know where the

684
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,170
data could be accessible not by

685
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:46,340
individuals but also as in the form of a

686
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,900
computation which goes across multiple

687
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,679
parties there are some solutions are

688
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,340
available for mathematical creation

689
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,810
because if that could be employed to it

690
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,879
another thing is that is the request for

691
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:05,389
Richard where you want to make sure that

692
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,990
the elements are arranged after after

693
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,390
particular time and similar to the

694
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,160
second scenarios where there any

695
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,650
question Amit could there could be you

696
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,810
can add queries or you can add the

697
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,190
instructions that goes from clients to

698
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,800
the blockchain so that through those

699
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,840
block chains not only based on time but

700
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,909
also based on the requests that is made

701
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,800
by the users we can introduce integers

702
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:32,810
by employing same things and basically

703
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,000
the image of the elements or the keys

704
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,830
appropriately could be employed that and

705
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,670
the keys that are employed either for

706
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,730
encryption or decryption of verification

707
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,940
appropriate of some encryption

708
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:47,010
commitment can be destroyed so that now

709
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,510
we can no longer associate information

710
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:53,220
that's the final thing which is I'll say

711
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,750
required significant change gives what

712
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,270
is known as our request for ratification

713
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,400
when you go to a change cementing so

714
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,790
that the entry still present for a user

715
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,230
but it's now change or its ratified and

716
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,610
there the interesting solutions could

717
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,400
work in terms of what is known as

718
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,719
deductible glob cheese and it's really

719
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,100
emerging concept they have no perfect

720
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,930
solution which I will put there

721
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,129
interesting solution that is emerging in

722
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:20,610
academia where the in will be now it is

723
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,070
possible for some players or a bunch of

724
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,290
player to become what what they can call

725
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,870
it gratifies so that when the request

726
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,090
comes and as long as we trust them as a

727
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,760
group not as individual but as a group

728
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,669
it is possible that they can change the

729
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,890
entry so that the same entry same what

730
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,720
we can welcome it in entry is now

731
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,910
associated with some other information

732
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,950
so I'm not changing the entry in the

733
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,170
blockchain but its interpretation could

734
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,550
be changed the way it is employing into

735
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,160
the blockchain and that's certainly

736
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,440
possible within concept called we have

737
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,120
several ideas but the key idea which is

738
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,760
known as called chameleon hash functions

739
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,979
it's a hash function but it's command so

740
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,930
that you can associate the same hash

741
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,150
value the same output to some other

742
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:06,030
inverse or do any input of your choice

743
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:08,130
if you know an appropriate key so such

744
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,320
concepts are getting build at least

745
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,510
academically but actually bringing them

746
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,000
so they they can work on the state of

747
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,040
that permission the permission makes

748
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,170
block chains that are employed is the

749
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,750
Stila it's still a challenge and it's

750
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,700
worth exploring but the message that I

751
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,820
want to give is that all these problems

752
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,680
are those which are present with D when

753
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,310
you look at that transparency offered by

754
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,780
blockchain and then we look at the

755
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:36,120
privacy rights that are typically

756
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,460
associate Gd P R it is possible to

757
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,320
welcome the solutions we have to modify

758
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,090
block shapes a little to make them work

759
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,429
but that's certainly something which is

760
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,310
durable and interesting solution could

761
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:50,400
be build even using the cryptography

762
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:52,139
knowledge that we possess to it so yeah

763
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,830
with that I'm coming to the end for my

764
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,350
talk

765
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,020
more you if you want to know more about

766
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,490
itself that we're doing go to our web

767
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,280
page and you'll be able to find out

768
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,500
project that they're already doing or in

769
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,500
general space regarding associate the

770
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,560
blockchains and its privacy okay thank

771
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,560
you

772
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:22,959
you
