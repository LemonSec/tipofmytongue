1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,138
okay good afternoon and welcome to the

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,870
serious seminar this afternoon I would

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:12,399
like to introduce Luke butcher Luke

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,229
Butcher comes from us from MasterCard

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,099
where he's a product management for

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,680
cyber and intelligence solutions so he's

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:22,899
gonna talk a little bit about connected

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,520
intelligence you can see artificial

9
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,200
intelligence on the screen so I think

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,509
this will be an interesting talk for you

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,058
I didn't notice his whistle and red card

12
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:33,010
but he is a longtime soccer official so

13
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,839
if anybody gets out of line you probably

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,890
get get given the red card so I just

15
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,530
thought I'd give you that little bit of

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,589
forewarning so with that I'll just turn

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:45,309
it over to Luke perfect Thank You Jerry

18
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:48,248
yes and I will kick off and talk today a

19
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:49,809
little bit about what artificial

20
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:52,510
intelligence and its application looks

21
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,879
like MasterCard today and what we where

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,469
we envision it going and you know that's

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,858
kind of the the piece that I talk about

24
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:03,010
a connected data of repository at least

25
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,960
of joined data where you can you know

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,360
leverage algorithms to pick up themes

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,890
and contexts the other piece that I'll

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,130
talk about a little bit later is the

29
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,160
value of fragmented or decentralized

30
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,050
data so MasterCard at its core its bread

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,509
and butter is a network connecting

32
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,000
someone who's looking to have a good or

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,700
service to someone who's able to to

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
provide it so taking that true that

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,540
mindset that paradigm and applying it

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,610
into a identity space so we'll get there

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,370
in the the second half so the first

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,710
piece is around artificial intelligence

39
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,770
within within MasterCard so this is not

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:45,669
a foreign concept to MasterCard we've

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,789
had data scientists and people working

42
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,100
in a artificial intelligence niche for

43
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,770
many years traditionally it's been in a

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,699
fraud capacity so every time that card

45
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,610
is swiped used online a risk score is

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,110
generated and sent to our bank partners

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,210
to help them make a decision on whether

48
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,150
it's a genuine user or not or it's

49
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,269
someone who has has taken over those

50
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,489
those credentials so it's been a fairly

51
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,989
niche part of our organization that's

52
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,790
certainly an important part but a niche

53
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:19,689
part of our organization

54
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:24,040
and we're now at this stage where we

55
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:25,299
really need to work to work across the

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,620
business to help the rest of the

57
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,870
business that traditionally hasn't had

58
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,519
to touch artificial intelligence didn't

59
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,010
have to understand artificial

60
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,200
intelligence and really bring them bring

61
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,179
them up to speed because we are at this

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,369
point where we see a lot of value and

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,959
potential in this space but you really

64
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,909
need the business owners who understand

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,069
their day-to-day life the problems of

66
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,358
the business that they face and for them

67
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,798
to have enough understanding of

68
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,109
artificial intelligence to see the

69
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:52,090
application and conversely you need

70
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,859
though that side of the business to be

71
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,190
able to educate those with the skills to

72
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:59,650
develop the relevant applications and

73
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,409
algorithms to understand the problems of

74
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,389
the business to to really find some some

75
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,349
middle ground to even find some of these

76
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:11,349
these case studies and why is this kind

77
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:14,138
of a priority so this is how I crowd the

78
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:16,089
the organization is really thinking and

79
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,010
seeing the application of artificial

80
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,470
intelligence we consider it kind of the

81
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,379
the third digital transformation across

82
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,760
the industry across the ecosystem and we

83
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,578
talk when we talk about a transformation

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,948
that means from our standpoint it's not

85
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,449
it's a change that goes beyond the

86
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,260
institutions that you traditionally

87
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,879
think about it so in the 1980s when we

88
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,010
talked about the proliferation of

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,569
computers right that was not just a

90
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,608
transformation that impact the

91
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,250
Microsoft's the the apples of the world

92
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,650
it's hard to imagine a single company

93
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,829
organization school that doesn't have a

94
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,099
computer today to maximize the potential

95
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:57,030
and productivity of the workforce

96
00:03:54,099 --> 00:04:00,310
students anyone who's a part of that

97
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,430
those institutions a kind of next wave

98
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,829
is is the internet if you had kind of

99
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,900
gone a few years prior and speaking to

100
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,959
individual consumers kind of hard to

101
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,879
have any of them say with any degree of

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,478
certainty or confidence that they would

103
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,139
ever make a purchase without seeing

104
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,639
feeling and trying something on and yet

105
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,280
we still have those apples and the

106
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,610
Amazons who are not just entering a

107
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,809
space but potentially are currently

108
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,300
transforming what retail

109
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,550
looks like in today's today's edge so

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,400
that's really what we mean by

111
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,110
transformation of really redefining of

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,090
everyone who has to to play in this

113
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,870
economy and finally we get to this

114
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,109
proliferation of artificial intelligence

115
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,750
when you're able to predict better it it

116
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,190
has meaningful impacts to the bottom

117
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,139
lines and the decisions that these

118
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,570
organization make these organizations

119
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,120
make and we think we're at the very cusp

120
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:04,419
of that and is part of why it's a

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,419
heightened importance to to MasterCard

122
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,790
so why now and why firm MasterCard so

123
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,330
the real value of artificial

124
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,580
intelligence from a hallway from machine

125
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,539
learning to a deep learning perspective

126
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,010
comes as these three pieces kind of feed

127
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,720
off of each other and each of them

128
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,940
really grow so you really don't have the

129
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,350
the scale and amount vast amount of data

130
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,390
to really leverage deep learning until

131
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,810
relatively until relatively recently so

132
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,969
as you get data from your traditional

133
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,550
sources as you get data from things like

134
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,289
the Internet of Things and new forms of

135
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,990
technology and you start to be able to

136
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:50,330
correlate all these different forms of

137
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,919
technology around a centralized user you

138
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,979
know it's just one example or

139
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,609
application it's a it's a new fodder

140
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:01,639
space for for these Institute

141
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,580
institutions to play in and with more

142
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,830
data you really can't do much with it if

143
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,020
you don't have the processing power

144
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,280
behind it so from a MasterCard

145
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,560
perspective we have had a trove of

146
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,679
processing power but traditionally have

147
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,560
not been harnessing it for algorithms

148
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,280
and artificial intelligence historically

149
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,970
it has been on processing transactions

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,260
globally managing to service level

151
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,630
agreements that are not measured in

152
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,729
seconds or even milliseconds like we're

153
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,159
talking even fractions of that so that's

154
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,460
you know looking at new ways of applying

155
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,330
what we've historically had a very high

156
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,729
degree of competency in historically

157
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,039
and then all of that - feeds into two

158
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:50,378
better algorithms right if you've got

159
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,659
enough enough data on enough processing

160
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,240
power you're able to apply those two

161
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:58,330
together and and really make make

162
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,460
something make something of it and then

163
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,800
the the graph on the the right of the

164
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,659
slide came from now one of Google's

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,000
cofounders of the the Google brain which

166
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:12,490
is there is a diminishing margin of

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,490
return when it comes definitely to human

168
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,560
learning to no one's surprise you can as

169
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,389
much incremental data as you add in

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,520
there there's only going to be so much

171
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,449
incremental value you'll you'll generate

172
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,979
out machine learning really relies on

173
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,259
structures that you're able to place on

174
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,090
on that incremental data so they're

175
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,409
there to is a diminishing margin of

176
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:38,679
return deep learning is really where we

177
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:40,210
expect that diminishing margin to not be

178
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,599
in the foreseeable future and really

179
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,479
part of that proliferation of artificial

180
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,250
intelligence transforming not just our

181
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:57,310
our industry but almost virtually every

182
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:59,800
economist tree across our economy NASA

183
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,569
for some of the the fun pieces the

184
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,699
application of it today within

185
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:07,210
MasterCard so today we've identified

186
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,830
around 130 different use cases and

187
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,068
applicate use cases for it

188
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,139
within within MasterCard I touched upon

189
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:18,009
a little bit around fraud detection so

190
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,629
our banks report in fraud to us and

191
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,120
historically we've used that fraud data

192
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,509
and correlated to transactional level

193
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,960
trends to estimate and try and predict

194
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:32,709
what type of risk vectors translate into

195
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,598
fraud now we're starting to do to be a

196
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,299
little more sophisticated on in how we

197
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,490
think about this so when we talk about

198
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:43,179
risk vectors generating fraud that's a

199
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,880
fairly to kind of reduce it a bit is a

200
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,430
there's a straight line level of fraud

201
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,649
reported in based on trends but as we

202
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,260
think about different card holders there

203
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:56,820
will be very natural anomalies in this

204
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,819
space that are not due to

205
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:01,748
in genuine or bad behavior so an Elon

206
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,199
Musk of the world

207
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:08,410
his very profile on spending habits

208
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:12,309
levels of spend are on their own going

209
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,459
to look like a very risky transaction

210
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:17,499
you know he's if he's traveling a lot

211
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,689
outside of a general Geographic radius

212
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:21,730
that most card holders tend to spend

213
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,089
within thirty to forty miles of their

214
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,519
home

215
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,709
you know he's traveling a lot the the

216
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,480
size of the purchases he's making those

217
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,669
alone tend to represent fraudulent

218
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,269
transactions but when you can break out

219
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:37,119
those individual entities and people and

220
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,939
understand no we don't really know who

221
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:42,100
Elon Musk is but we can associate for

222
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,988
that card that's what genuine activity

223
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,999
represents and to take that

224
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:47,350
understanding and apply it to what has

225
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,600
been traditionally kind of a straight

226
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,720
line model of what's been reported and

227
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,040
what our traditional our traditional

228
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,850
fraud vectors next application is in

229
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,949
finance so all public companies report

230
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,230
their the quarterly returns and then

231
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:08,079
there's a lot of hoopla around the

232
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,959
year-end returns a lot of business

233
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,699
decisions operating decisions go into

234
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,229
whether they miss or make their forecast

235
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,199
although I can't help but chuckling a

236
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,230
little bit that that forecast is

237
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:24,729
imperfect so as as accurate as they can

238
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,610
be with the tools and resources that

239
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,889
they have before them that forecast is

240
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,119
only as good as the people and the

241
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,259
drivers that they've placed into that

242
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:37,299
model and this is certainly not a

243
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,589
foreign concept to to MasterCard as well

244
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:44,589
so understanding and being able to apply

245
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,269
AI into an organization picking up on

246
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,809
drivers that haven't historically been

247
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,160
measured really pulling that into a

248
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:55,118
forecast that goes out to the street it

249
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,009
is going to produce more reliable more

250
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,919
accurate forecasting for many of these

251
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:01,689
these businesses that you know hard to

252
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,389
say how often it happens but may just be

253
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:06,248
missing missing or beating their their

254
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,410
numbers just because they forecasted

255
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,720
quite poorly which has an impact to

256
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,030
anyone who chooses to to invest in in

257
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,140
this

258
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:18,500
market next one is within human

259
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,569
resources for those of you have not have

260
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,480
gone through the the process of being

261
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,450
hired or being an intern there are a lot

262
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,700
of steps that a company goes through to

263
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,550
vet someone there's the understanding

264
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,740
what someone's experiences on paper

265
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,219
there are the interviews by teammates

266
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,800
and team members on and hiring managers

267
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,690
excuse me on whether they think that

268
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,550
candidate will be a good fit on on a

269
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,230
team there I mean there are companies

270
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,060
that are going through trend analysis

271
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,880
and making sure that keywords are are

272
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,920
put into a resume I mean that is just a

273
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,270
very easy system to beat you just look

274
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,569
up what those keywords are and you apply

275
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,380
them to the paper so it's it's very

276
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:03,350
difficult and will save any any horror

277
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,390
stories in that arena for for later but

278
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,340
it's very difficult to really match up a

279
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,870
person who has the right experience and

280
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,690
is a good fit and has a lot of potential

281
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,800
within it within a company to those open

282
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:19,250
job roles and postings and part of that

283
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,040
is because it's people have to do that

284
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,150
evaluation and make their best judgment

285
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,620
but if you could start to apply

286
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,050
artificial intelligence to this start

287
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,090
really applying it across their

288
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,099
experiences across how they how they

289
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,410
potentially perform in an interview and

290
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,090
the responses that they give maybe there

291
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,010
are some things that we are not picking

292
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,470
up on that would actually be far better

293
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:47,150
indicators than anything we've used use

294
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:50,960
historically product recommender and

295
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,530
from from a sales standpoint one a

296
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,180
little close to my heart

297
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,430
within MasterCard we have you know

298
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,989
across our core products our value add

299
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,099
service products in our consulting arm

300
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:07,280
around 300 different products people are

301
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,410
imperfect and it's very hard to fathom

302
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,069
being able to teach a whole sales force

303
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,079
that many different products so it's one

304
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,810
understanding the products what they do

305
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,810
and the value that they can add to its

306
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,119
also understanding where the application

307
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,040
of those products are within within a

308
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,860
customer so it's it's really

309
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,459
and joining those two up and what

310
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,000
happens in in reality is you get a sales

311
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,109
force who is fairly familiar with a

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,759
subset of those products you know if

313
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,220
you're lucky it's going to be somewhere

314
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,810
in the camp of 20 to 30 so you're

315
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,810
unlucky we're probably looking at five

316
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,508
to ten but they are very good and are

317
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,540
that applying and understanding where

318
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:52,790
that can go within a customer to help

319
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,099
their their business driver but if you

320
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:59,930
applied a little bit of understanding of

321
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,490
the data that's coming in from from

322
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,719
these customers whether they are banks

323
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,170
whether they are merchants and retailers

324
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,259
or providers and supporters of those two

325
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,540
two entities if you can understand their

326
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:13,009
businesses understand the product lines

327
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,339
you've now

328
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:18,290
honed in and facilitated for the the

329
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,630
sales force what they really need to be

330
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,459
focusing on and learning so instead of

331
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,100
giving them a huge menu of three to four

332
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,910
hundred products you give them let's say

333
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,470
five to ten every every quarter and say

334
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,199
we think that these are the ideal

335
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,779
recommended solutions you know go up

336
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,859
read on them have customer conversations

337
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:41,269
and you from there you know for those

338
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,000
that work great for those that don't

339
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:46,699
move on but you're having very tactical

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
and very meaningful conversations that

341
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:50,449
make the most of everyone's time

342
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,940
certainly the the MasterCard sales force

343
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,800
and sales forces across the globe who

344
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,209
struggle with the same thing but also

345
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,790
from a Custer standpoint you're not

346
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,229
weeding through many iterations of a

347
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,060
conversation to find out that this

348
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,620
really doesn't doesn't make sense and

349
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,329
didn't really have a chance from from

350
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,790
the get-go you're really looking to

351
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,290
expedite and facilitate the the

352
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,579
conversations to something that's a

353
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,490
little more meaningful and tangible log

354
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,709
analysis from our audit teams

355
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,860
historically audit has been a very

356
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:24,410
manual process trying to identify what

357
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,329
is going to be a red flag what is a

358
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,339
warning sign that really needs to be

359
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,680
followed up on to determine if it's a

360
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,500
red flag or not and those instances that

361
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,019
are just really nothing nothing to worry

362
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,910
about but it's a process that people

363
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,720
continue to invest millions in because

364
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,469
it

365
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,290
of the risk our legal arm is certainly

366
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:49,310
not at risk of job security because of

367
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:52,639
this but the applications of artificial

368
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,649
intelligence and understanding what what

369
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,149
red flags we knew of historically and

370
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,829
finding and finding and catching them

371
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,779
sooner as well as ones we had never

372
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:01,489
identified before and really applying

373
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,620
that to our business and getting ahead

374
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,620
of ahead of a curve of something that

375
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,410
could be potentially quite dangerous or

376
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:13,399
disastrous or at least quite costly to

377
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:16,069
to an organization the final one is

378
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,579
social media trend analysis so

379
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:21,769
MasterCard is a b2b organization we you

380
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,469
know despite that that brand on the

381
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:28,759
front of the card we tend to be behind

382
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:31,279
the scenes and try to keep it that way

383
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,300
the problem with that is we don't have

384
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,829
first hand reactions or insights into

385
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,019
what's necessarily happening with card

386
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,420
holders so if something fails and

387
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,250
something goes wrong and for some reason

388
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,709
our redundant systems and platforms

389
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,459
didn't catch it didn't pick up on it for

390
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:53,119
whatever reason we have to really rely

391
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:56,660
on consumer sentiment to to catch these

392
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,519
problems which is not a great way to to

393
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,730
run a business because the way this

394
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,649
works is something goes wrong cardholder

395
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,959
looks to make a transaction and it

396
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,510
doesn't go through that's the voice of

397
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,689
one calls into a bank complains about it

398
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,929
probably nothing else happens now maybe

399
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:17,360
dozens it happens to and ideally at this

400
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,400
point the bank says okay actually there

401
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,188
is a problem let me reach out to

402
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,919
MasterCard likely it's dozens on dozens

403
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:28,220
if not hundreds of people who are

404
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,799
impacted before a problem and firestorm

405
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,419
is is created so where we can get ahead

406
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,000
where we can understand where we can

407
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:37,940
catch these trends even faster without

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,270
relying on on intermediary part parties

409
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,789
to catch it for us the better again

410
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,539
where we can be proactive on these front

411
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:50,960
lines really helps us get ahead of the

412
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:52,550
curve mitigate costs from remediation

413
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,470
and damages that we need to

414
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,320
to resolve and allows us a little more

415
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:03,770
time and flexibility in fixing problems

416
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:07,639
before before they escalate and this is

417
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:09,920
just just kind of a summary slide on you

418
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,100
know it's machine learning is really not

419
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,110
taking away anyone's jobs it's just

420
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,090
really transfer transforming them and

421
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,189
changing what they what they mean so it

422
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,260
really takes individuals who understand

423
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,630
the business understand the problems to

424
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,629
be able to apply that and see the

425
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:29,240
opportunities within artificial

426
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,490
intelligence to make everyone's lives

427
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,290
better and it's also on the flip side

428
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,210
those with the technical skills to

429
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,310
operationalize it to understand the

430
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:42,620
business to find where where those

431
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:45,320
applications are so that's really

432
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,429
artificial intelligence within

433
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,899
MasterCard so that you can only draw

434
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,630
correlations and causations when you

435
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,200
have you have all the data at your

436
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,710
fingertips or at least have needles out

437
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,060
there to to pick up on it

438
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,100
however mentioned a bit earlier that

439
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,020
mastercards bread and butter is actually

440
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,750
just being a network and connecting

441
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,280
multiple parties to each other and there

442
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,500
is still a lot of value in that

443
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,160
there is a lot of value in not being a

444
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,070
honeypot of of information being a prime

445
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,980
source or target for that and one of

446
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:26,629
those chief opportunities we see in this

447
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:29,690
is around digital identity and there's a

448
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,240
few trends that are driving this you

449
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,540
know one is identity verification upon

450
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,710
setup so this could be everything from

451
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,540
new bank accounts that you need to set

452
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,430
up for you need to verify who you are

453
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,909
when you when you register for school

454
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,700
for classes you need to register for

455
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,140
this when we talk about a gig economy I

456
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,150
sure want to be confident that the lifts

457
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,980
and ubers of the world have done some

458
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,720
form of check before I'm getting into a

459
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,220
car with someone driving at 60 miles per

460
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,990
hour there is the expectation right it's

461
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,550
a it's a digital space in which you're

462
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,500
verifying your identity there's a

463
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:08,899
consumer expectation that it's seamless

464
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,760
it's secure and it's a very private

465
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,830
experience you know we've certainly seen

466
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,110
a few institutions misuse that

467
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,600
information before so how do you help

468
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,090
maintain that consumer trust when you're

469
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,990
trying to verify their identity across a

470
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:27,360
few organizations there's also this idea

471
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,000
that connected devices is not making

472
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,699
this job any easier with the Alexus the

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,040
Google homes in the world those have

474
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,590
even fewer ways of being able to

475
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,510
identify a person who is who they say

476
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,389
they are but you can make purchases on

477
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,080
those on those devices shortly they'll

478
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,720
be able to make financial decisions

479
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,669
logging into banks making high-risk

480
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,250
transactions and understanding who you

481
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:57,000
are it's going to be crucial for for

482
00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:00,570
those devices the other one is around

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,780
regular regulation so GDP are for those

484
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:06,270
who are not familiar is a European

485
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:08,910
regulation around putting control of a

486
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,770
consumers data into their hands so at

487
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:15,060
its core consumer can go to any

488
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,250
institution from a bank to a merchant

489
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,590
who's holding their data and say I don't

490
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,850
want you to be holding any I don't want

491
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,159
you to have any of the historical data

492
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,159
that you have on me to be making

493
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,870
decisions either broadly or about me

494
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,240
specifically but there's on the converse

495
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,850
side there's also this idea of leveling

496
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,210
a playing field it's very difficult for

497
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,649
a start-up or a new institution or an

498
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,270
old institution who just hasn't

499
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,520
historically had access to this data

500
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,850
come into a space when they're a

501
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,180
newcomer write a a bank a credit scoring

502
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,350
agency are these stalwarts who have had

503
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,470
hadn't been able to look at this data

504
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,270
for years decades someone who's new and

505
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,450
wants to offer new services a new way to

506
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,410
score credit is never going to be able

507
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,570
to compete if we've kind of centralized

508
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,980
all this data into a group of a few

509
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,429
institutions and given them a lot of

510
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,950
power

511
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:15,870
I will pick and choose some of these so

512
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,700
we don't iterate through each one of

513
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:23,120
these

514
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:26,029
the 7.5 billion user so on one side

515
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,649
India did an amazing thing in

516
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:31,799
nationalizing a their identity platform

517
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:33,959
for all of their citizens so

518
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,799
historically the base of the pyramid are

519
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,419
the ones who are most unlikely to be

520
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,980
able to identify themselves digitally

521
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,320
but they're also the ones who are most

522
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,299
likely to need whatever they are

523
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,010
verifying their identity for that

524
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,918
infrastructure those social services

525
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,260
those are the platforms that those at

526
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,659
that base of the pyramid struggle to

527
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,149
connect with are the ones who also need

528
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,659
it the most so India did a phenomenal

529
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:02,850
thing registered all their citizens got

530
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,820
biometric data on them but it also

531
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,908
prevents that it's also a risk right

532
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,610
that the government now holds a very

533
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:14,789
rich repository of information that is

534
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,709
an absolute goldmine in honeypot that

535
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:18,419
they have to be very careful with now

536
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,179
going forward and making sure that they

537
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,220
are very secure in how they manage that

538
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,010
data the third parties that have access

539
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,110
to it and the third parties that need to

540
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,240
use that data to verify those

541
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:38,610
individuals and so it certainly provides

542
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:41,789
a risk in in that space so not

543
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,649
surprisingly we would we expect that our

544
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,480
vision of digital identity be to be

545
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,059
something that's very simple something

546
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,510
very accessible in today's day and age

547
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:55,168
most have a smartphone but especially my

548
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,720
India example not always but you know

549
00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:00,600
providing some form of infrastructure or

550
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,669
access to this that's simple safe but

551
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,029
it's also unique is giving the consumer

552
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:10,260
more say and more control in in how they

553
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:12,630
do it so I'll probably spend most of the

554
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,269
time on this piece which is really how

555
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:18,000
we envision this this operating and

556
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:20,700
working so in the middle there are two

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,860
there are two entities one R is the

558
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,440
customer who's got this need to identify

559
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,049
and verify themselves either for the

560
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,490
first time or on an ongoing basis

561
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,059
depending on the relationship that they

562
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,299
have

563
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:37,570
second is MasterCard sees itself there

564
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:40,480
as the connector of all these different

565
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,879
institutions so we do not want to be

566
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,029
this honeypot we merely want to be the

567
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:49,178
rails connecting these institutions so

568
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:51,220
will be the rails will create a uniform

569
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,529
and standardized process for an exchange

570
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,600
of this information but we really don't

571
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,269
want to hold it don't want to have

572
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,269
access to this and B be our own honeypot

573
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:03,369
we've got certainly enough problems with

574
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:05,619
people trying to penetrate our systems

575
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:10,990
today we're not really looking to add

576
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:15,399
even more fuel to the fire so might make

577
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:17,320
sense to walk through a example of this

578
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,928
walking walking through each of these

579
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,399
these players selfishly since I'm up

580
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,659
here speaking I'm going to choose one

581
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:26,498
that I had to go through just a few

582
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:28,960
hours ago renting a car hurts only

583
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:31,929
needed a when I went online to register

584
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,830
and book a car hurts really only needs

585
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:38,679
one piece of information am i older than

586
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,360
25 or not and traditionally today the

587
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,759
way you answer that is by giving them

588
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,350
your birthday now Hertz has extra

589
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,269
information than they actually even

590
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,209
needed they don't really care about it

591
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:52,480
but now they have created a lucrative

592
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:55,899
source of data that's used in opening up

593
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,720
accounts and all sorts of pieces of

594
00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:01,689
information but the question in this

595
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,970
framework is could Hertz just ask if you

596
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:07,059
are older than 25 or not not caring

597
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,700
whether you're 80 or 26 and so the way

598
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:12,428
this we envision this being as Hertz as

599
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,950
this this relying party it it's relying

600
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,799
on information from other providers in

601
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:21,399
the ecosystem could Hertz just connect

602
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:25,149
with potentially your bank and say you

603
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:28,719
know Citibank Bank of America is luke

604
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:30,969
older than 25 answer is just a yes no

605
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,570
it's dichotomous it's not a it's not

606
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:36,639
something that they need to hold a store

607
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:39,100
on their on their side so you've got

608
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:41,559
some form of trust provider that could

609
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,439
be a bank it could be a mobile network

610
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,990
operator a cell phone provider

611
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,540
many many of those institutions could

612
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,250
provide that it could also be something

613
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,899
that's less significant and you don't

614
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,390
need to go to that extreme right it

615
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,790
could be around social media right and

616
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,430
making sure that you've got some other

617
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:03,970
entity of information that's less secure

618
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:07,960
and not as necessary because the risk

619
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:10,720
isn't as high there so you've now got an

620
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,330
entity who said yep I verified that

621
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,790
piece of information what you still need

622
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,530
though is someone to say Lucas who they

623
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,200
say they are because it's just as easy

624
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,430
to just verify a piece of information

625
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,950
without verifying that person is who

626
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,020
they say they are so that's where the

627
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,460
identity verification provider again

628
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,860
could be a mobile network operator who's

629
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,180
known you for many many years it could

630
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,709
be a government that holds everything

631
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,440
from birth certificates to Social

632
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,050
Security numbers to say yep Lucas who he

633
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,580
says it says he is that way you can

634
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,190
trust the bank's information that he's

635
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,790
older than 25 and right there you've had

636
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,520
a exchange of information that is

637
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,649
distributed doesn't have a doesn't

638
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,680
create honey pots on on any side of it

639
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:56,170
but has provided all the information and

640
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,240
nothing more than is needed so that's

641
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,800
that's kind of our vision of what

642
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,530
digital identity

643
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,680
looks like I'm going forward that we're

644
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:08,830
looking to start really ramping up and

645
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:14,380
scaling early early and throughout

646
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:16,780
throughout next year so to two pieces on

647
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,280
on this slide if this is of interest we

648
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,370
can also certainly circulate it after

649
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,070
this this class we've got a public white

650
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,870
paper on this that is far more specific

651
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,530
and detailed than I can be in a in a

652
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,899
short class so that's that's open that's

653
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,740
out there and accessible and the other

654
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,110
piece is you know MasterCard is not the

655
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,900
only player who's trying to solve this

656
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,780
problem and everyone has their own their

657
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,450
own pillars so we've got ten many of

658
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,889
them are fairly similar to what other

659
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,190
providers are looking to do out in the

660
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:54,940
ecosystem one that is a little different

661
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:57,190
that we see ourselves standing apart on

662
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,029
and would ideally like others who are

663
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,429
looking to solve this

664
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:02,799
problem also include is this idea of

665
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,960
inclusion right those who need the

666
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,090
access to this who need to verify who

667
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,149
struggled to do this the most tend to be

668
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,689
the ones who need whatever services that

669
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:16,539
they are what they are verifying for

670
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:21,340
this is not a a new piece for for

671
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:25,179
MasterCard we also have a our own kind

672
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,158
of charitable organization that's apart

673
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:29,440
from the business that looks to broaden

674
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:33,009
Financial Inclusion really providing

675
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,109
access to financial systems to those who

676
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:37,479
haven't had it before which breaks the

677
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,849
systems around loan sharks and really

678
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:41,710
perpetuating poverty and that ecosystem

679
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:43,839
so we're taking that same pillar from

680
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:48,789
there and applying it to to digital

681
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:52,539
identity and then finally I kind of just

682
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:54,820
picked on one one use case but we see a

683
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:57,849
plethora of use cases for for digital

684
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,428
identity so I'll start with the seamless

685
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:02,950
travel because that's that's where the

686
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:05,320
example I picked up on but so it applies

687
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:08,139
to a rental car and applies to airlines

688
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,269
hotels all of those need to verify a

689
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,589
person is who they say they are and in

690
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,599
the process likely take on more

691
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:16,719
information than they really need and

692
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:20,908
quite candidly probably want right below

693
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:24,219
that is age-related sales so

694
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:27,279
traditionally this is around alcohol and

695
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:29,499
looking to make those types of purchases

696
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,629
but they're not the only ones there are

697
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:36,219
definitely other other purchases out

698
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:39,728
there that require age verification the

699
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:42,309
other is around very personal and

700
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:45,519
sensitive information whether it's legal

701
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,559
documents trusts in the States stuff

702
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,210
that still gets delivered in paper form

703
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,989
and making sure that they get delivered

704
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,690
to who they are supposed to without

705
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:57,909
creating too much of a burden or

706
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,639
ownership on on those trying to deliver

707
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:02,859
or receive that information there's also

708
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:06,789
background checks so you know in a

709
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:10,599
sharing a sharing economy those who need

710
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,890
to be a part of a gig economy verifying

711
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,280
who they say they are at the

712
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,380
of income an income would also apply to

713
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,540
rent and mortgages and all that all that

714
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,310
fun stuff

715
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:26,170
there's also the that I dented high-risk

716
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,879
identity verification so new bank

717
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,040
accounts you know applying for a

718
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,320
passport for the first time applying for

719
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,020
a driver's license those key pillars of

720
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,220
who you say you are

721
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,350
someone needs to verify that for the

722
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,180
first time and be pretty sure that you

723
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:46,149
are who you say you are kyc applying for

724
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,130
credits loans you know financial things

725
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:52,500
the other piece is you think about

726
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:55,290
health care for those of you who are

727
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,060
lucky enough to not know this example

728
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:00,280
it's great but when you need to share

729
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,360
information across health care providers

730
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:07,389
so that they can make a single and

731
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,879
hopefully agreeable diagnosis it's very

732
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,220
hard to share that information just

733
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,990
around the privacy laws and regulation

734
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,460
that exists in that space so if you can

735
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,710
simplify the identity identity

736
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:22,240
verification you can facilitate that

737
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:24,340
exchange between multiple providers and

738
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,690
then when we we call it digital identity

739
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,610
but there's also quite a few

740
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,370
applications of face to face that are

741
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,860
arising where it is a face to face

742
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,260
exchange but the data and verification

743
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,500
happens in a digital medium so when we

744
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,510
think it's a large problem with people's

745
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,860
Amazon's Amazon's in a long day

746
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,570
people's Amazon packages just being

747
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,260
taken off the stoop and doorstep

748
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,399
so Amazon's looking at new ways to

749
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,560
provide those packages in a secure

750
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,140
manner sometimes that's putting it in

751
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,510
the trunk of your your BMW or Audi it's

752
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,150
you know going into a section of a house

753
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:03,370
that's been verified or cornered off but

754
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,860
still locked off except for one specific

755
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:08,560
moment when a package is being delivered

756
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,899
it's a face-to-face interaction but

757
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,450
whoever's there whoever's present needs

758
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,790
to be verified via a digital medium not

759
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:20,920
through some key that's already been

760
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:23,559
exchanged historically that

761
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,920
that's kind of the value that and where

762
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,840
we're looking from a decentralized

763
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,860
standpoint and see a lot of value coming

764
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,290
from on the data the data front so you

765
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,320
know very broadly those are two vastly

766
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:42,040
different applications at MasterCard is

767
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,770
very excited and pursuing for quite

768
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,178
wholeheartedly shareholders are also

769
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,309
equally excited about both of these

770
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:51,130
spaces because they represent quite a

771
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:55,149
lot of need as well as potential for for

772
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:59,440
the organization so I've done quite a

773
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:02,620
bit of talking I will turn it over to

774
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:12,970
any questions that anyone has in either

775
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:16,560
of these two spaces it's either a sign

776
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,560
that I did that very well or very poorly

777
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,929
I'm wondering who else is doing this

778
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,969
type of digital life sort of platform

779
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,690
that you're towards because you talked

780
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:34,178
about other people and well so I'm just

781
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:37,570
curious who else are doing that yeah so

782
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:42,570
it's there are quite a few startups who

783
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:44,440
think they've got a new view or a few

784
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,810
perception in the space that they're

785
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,179
certainly trudging forward with it so

786
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,509
you've got want that end of the spectrum

787
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,550
but you've also got no not really

788
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,139
government's they're just kind of behind

789
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,869
the curve but you've got people who have

790
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:01,180
this this rich data who actually exhibit

791
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:03,460
a lot of potential in this space so the

792
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,819
mobile network operators of the world

793
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:10,600
are looking to do this and you've also

794
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:12,460
got entities kind of in-between who

795
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,009
struggle with this problem but also

796
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:18,310
could be part of the solution to it so

797
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:20,950
without naming any one entities who have

798
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,230
a lot of rich data on your social media

799
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,540
for instance are also starting to

800
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:28,060
explore do they tackle this space

801
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,410
directly or do they work with with

802
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,680
entities like MasterCard or some of

803
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,029
these

804
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,259
providers in a in a shared ecosystem so

805
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:38,080
without naming names it's kind of a wide

806
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:43,810
a wide swath of organizations looking to

807
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:45,940
to solve this problem in the future do

808
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:51,460
you see blockchain technology moving

809
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:55,110
into this space in part it's a fair

810
00:35:51,460 --> 00:36:00,070
question and not financially but just in

811
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:01,600
information sharing absolutely so not

812
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,860
covered today but we certainly have a

813
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,650
whole group who's working on blockchain

814
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,590
and it's it's varying applications so to

815
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,660
your point tempted to jump the gun and

816
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,060
talk about payment but there is

817
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,649
definitely application for it in a

818
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:23,410
digital exchange so when we talk about

819
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:29,200
how this data is shared and the mediums

820
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:31,779
that's shared I will not you know make

821
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,540
forward-looking statements but a medium

822
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,940
for that could be blockchain right and

823
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,190
standardizing the protocols that these

824
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,960
different institutions are using to

825
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,550
exchange that information so the

826
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,300
applications and how this gets executed

827
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:49,290
