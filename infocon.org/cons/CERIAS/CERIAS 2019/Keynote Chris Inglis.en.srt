1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
please join me in welcoming the

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:11,400
distinguished Chris Inglis thanks guys

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:12,690
thank you thank you if we could start

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,139
the slides can you all hear me in the

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,360
back

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,490
excellent so don't late to be here I'm

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,109
having flown into Indianapolis last

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,750
night and driven across I know why I've

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,100
not been here yet but but you know I am

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,869
just delighted to be here

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,400
Purdue's reputation at the National

12
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,220
Security Agency in various places where

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,750
I've gone precedes itself I happened to

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,759
graduate from the US Air Force captain

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,800
II which has I think the third highest

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,809
population representative within the

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,218
astronaut corps I teach at the Naval

18
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,750
Academy which is number two on the list

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,239
and Here I am at Purdue which is number

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,219
one for a good reason

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,989
kind of spats introduction

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,719
notwithstanding I once had to explain to

23
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,949
my eight-year-old at the time what the

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,989
deputy director of the National Security

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
Agency does and I did so in my best

26
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,070
unclassified voice and when I was all

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,730
done he said so you don't do anything

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,559
right which is probably about right in

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,148
terms of meeting strategy testifying

30
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,128
before Congress kind of you know you're

31
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,530
the magnet so that they don't bother the

32
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,390
people who do the real work today I'm

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,270
going to talk about security in the age

34
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,290
of cyber as opposed to cybersecurity

35
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,850
because I think cybersecurity is

36
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,700
sometimes while I do think it is a

37
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,309
misnomer we focus on it for its own sake

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,840
as opposed to the larger purpose we have

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,759
a major at the United States Naval

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,799
Academy it's now the second most popular

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,040
major on the campus out of 25 different

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,140
majors so about 13 14 percent of the

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,090
class signs up for that major and not at

44
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,159
the expense of computer science in no

45
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,860
small part attributable to the mentoring

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,619
and guidance of staff who's part of our

47
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,189
cyber oversight board but in that major

48
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,020
we essentially teach kids 17 to 21 year

49
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,939
olds professional kind of aspiring

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,829
military officers we teach them how to

51
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,600
make strategic choices in a world

52
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,449
dependent upon digital infrastructure

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,429
and that's certainly got a technology

54
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,259
underpinning but more importantly it's

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,119
got a strategy underpinning it's got an

56
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,740
operational Theory underpinning it's got

57
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,329
an ethical underpinning it's got a legal

58
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,920
underpinning then I'm going to talk a

59
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,020
little bit today about perhaps how to

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,690
think about that at the 30,000 foot

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,679
level not the technical details and not

62
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,019
the kind of

63
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,969
your hands over a little map but rather

64
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,459
to say if the United States and

65
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,200
like-minded nations needs a strategy for

66
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,629
how to think about this space

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,578
I offer my own experience in this regard

68
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,379
I'm a member of the defense Science

69
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,549
Board I'm on the FedEx Board of

70
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,709
Directors we've had some interesting

71
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,389
experiences in cyberspace we think we're

72
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,939
in a cyber skirmish every day of the

73
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,340
year I'm currently on the cyberspace

74
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,750
hilarium Commission and so I'm charged

75
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,340
to think about this I'm not sure my

76
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,620
thinking is fully mature but I'll offer

77
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,180
what I have in that regard if I might

78
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,150
start with a joke is that permissible

79
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,379
here all right so excellent so so you

80
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,030
know working at the National Scare you

81
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,168
know how you can tell an extrovert from

82
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,819
an introvert right you've heard the

83
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,620
story all right next to Bert looks at

84
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,200
your shoes in the conversation all right

85
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,120
so look at me I'm gonna tell the joke so

86
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,950
I was an Air Force pilot for 26 years

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,769
meaning that that's true that's not the

88
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,719
joke meaning I was happy once and for 21

89
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,290
of those years I flew a single airplane

90
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,879
type of c-130 c-130s a big lumbering

91
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,000
beast doesn't actually fly makes enough

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,129
noise to scare the ground away but but I

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,930
flew a B model which tells you something

94
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,448
about the variant of the technology on

95
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,099
board I flew an e model which was a

96
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,049
little bit more kind of current and then

97
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,720
I flew a J model which was very current

98
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,340
right fly-by-wire and removed the

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,829
navigator remove the engineer install

100
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,449
them in a box the V model the first one

101
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,879
that I flew had technology that dated

102
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,530
back to 1650 it had a sextant on board

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
if you want to know where you were in

104
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,260
the middle of Pacific Ocean you

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,750
essentially shot the moon the Sun the

106
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,429
Stars you got a triangle three lines of

107
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,079
bearing that was about that big for

108
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,909
those of you in the back turns out the

109
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,859
Pacific is about this big so it's good

110
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,228
enough but but it's not helpful because

111
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,970
that triangles the size of Texas but

112
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,049
that's not the joke the joke runs a

113
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,109
little bit like this

114
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,689
c-130 has four engines those who are

115
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,859
pilots in the room show of hands those

116
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,939
of you who are passengers in the room

117
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,500
show of hands

118
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,659
you're all familiar with the story I'm

119
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,400
about to tell four engine airplane takes

120
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,168
off the most dangerous phase of flight

121
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,519
of course is the take off leg right

122
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,079
because if something goes wrong there

123
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,579
you probably you might not have the

124
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,900
rudder authority to do the thing that

125
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,459
you should you might not have enough

126
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,250
power to take off you might have too

127
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,079
little runway to essentially stop and so

128
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,789
it's a kind of an interesting moment so

129
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,349
you motor through the the takeoff you

130
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,180
make enough noise you scare the ground

131
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,400
away huge sigh of relief up front you

132
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,889
know

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,330
lumbering up to altitude and in this

134
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,070
four engine beast you get to about

135
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,599
eighteen nineteen thousand feet in the

136
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,400
day that was actually about as good as

137
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,539
we can do fully loaded up and you're

138
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,888
heading outbound you're heading away

139
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,080
from the United States to some

140
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,400
interesting place it turns out c-130 can

141
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,719
only get you halfway there so you

142
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,520
probably head into an island somewhere

143
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,650
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean but

144
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,870
all the same you get about three four

145
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,659
hours off the eastern seaboard heading

146
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,520
for maybe lodges in the Azores and you

147
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,960
passed the equal time point huge sigh of

148
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,430
relief upfront because you don't have to

149
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,500
go back to the United States it's a good

150
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,990
time to be away from Washington but

151
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,580
that's another story

152
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,289
and as you're cruising along you kind of

153
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,000
hear this sputter and you kind of look

154
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,949
out the window and you see this kind of

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,050
puff of smoke and a little bit of flame

156
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,430
and you realize you're about to lose the

157
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,830
number one engine won over you or four

158
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,139
engines actually up front it's a moment

159
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,780
of huge relief it's joy because this

160
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,860
boring kind of sojourn is now about to

161
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,530
be populated with something interesting

162
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,120
a bar story if you will right so you

163
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,638
essentially go through the routines of

164
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,440
shutting that engine down there's a kind

165
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,910
of script that you have to follow to

166
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,039
show that you've got the right stuff and

167
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,260
then just like in a car if you want to

168
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,789
essentially extend your distance you

169
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,320
lower the speed and you would in this

170
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,370
case lower your altitude so you're gonna

171
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,630
be a little bit lower a little bit

172
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,940
slower so that you can essentially

173
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,229
increase your range and you announce

174
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,940
that with some amount of pride to the

175
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,590
passengers and crew we've lost an engine

176
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,849
don't worry we've got four we can do

177
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,380
this on three we'll be a little bit

178
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,419
lower a little bit slower but we'll make

179
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,760
it just fine now I'm gonna fast-forward

180
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,930
the story of it and they lose a second

181
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,580
engine still a moment of great joy

182
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,280
upfront because this is really going to

183
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,109
be a very interesting bar story so they

184
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,489
kind of secure the engine they announce

185
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,960
to the passions crew will be a little

186
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,849
bit lower a little bit slower but we can

187
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,888
make it on two engines we're already at

188
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,539
altitude they lose a third engine not

189
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,930
realizing there's a trend developing

190
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,639
here

191
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,409
and I'm going to lift and shift this to

192
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,930
cyberspace in just a moment but they

193
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,789
lose a third engine and they kind of you

194
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,710
know the octave of their voice is up

195
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,419
just a little bit still pretty exciting

196
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,849
if we survive this this will be the most

197
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,560
amazing bar story so they shut that

198
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,120
engine down they're motoring limping

199
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,770
along on one engine they announced to

200
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,510
the pastors and crew well thank goodness

201
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,430
we've got four engines because already

202
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,780
at altitude we can limp along it one

203
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,580
will be a little bit lower a little bit

204
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,289
slower but I think I think we just might

205
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,419
be able to make it at which point a

206
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,259
passenger in the back goes well hope we

207
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,818
don't lose the lad

208
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:44,979
because if we do we'll be up here all

209
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:48,009
day now now now why do I tell that story

210
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:49,479
you know first I like the story second I

211
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,039
think that there's actually a very

212
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,840
strong analogy in what's happening in

213
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,090
cyberspace right we've experienced

214
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,250
pratfall after pratfall cut after cut

215
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,020
death by a thousand cuts and we think

216
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,090
we're okay because we've got another one

217
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,219
we've got another ten we can limp along

218
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,900
we're already at altitude we're cruising

219
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,460
we've got this fall of momentum not

220
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,960
realizing there just might be a step

221
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,659
function out there this could be

222
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,549
existential if not to the critical

223
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,250
functions that we rely on cyberspace for

224
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,409
maybe to our expectations and perhaps

225
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,780
our expectations will diminish our

226
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,180
aspirations will diminish and we'll make

227
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,869
far less use of cyberspace this is great

228
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,940
good this unalloyed good that can solve

229
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,919
cancer in our lifetime that can solve

230
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,830
the weather problems in our lifetime can

231
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,049
do all of the magic and wonder that we

232
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,550
all know it to be right and so I'm going

233
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,039
to talk a little bit today about how I

234
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,840
think about that what then might be a

235
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,270
strategy to put the various pieces

236
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,008
together and it won't be any surprise to

237
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,139
you that the pieces I think or at least

238
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:49,779
at the kind of the 50,000 foot level

239
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,270
technology people right the human

240
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:56,009
component and procedure policy doctrine

241
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,330
that sort of thing so let's begin I

242
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:02,319
think I point this thing at the spaff

243
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,870
bobble head okay good all the lower set

244
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,370
a button great okay good I don't think

245
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,199
anybody in the room needs to kind of

246
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,490
read these words but essentially it says

247
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,199
if you look to the folks that are

248
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,839
responsible for critical functions the

249
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,879
top box talks about what the Securities

250
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,800
Exchange Commission says about publicly

251
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,839
traded companies but any company relied

252
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,849
upon digital infrastructure says be very

253
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,560
afraid and if you look at the bottom box

254
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,569
it says that the Director of National

255
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,300
Intelligence as recently as two months

256
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,430
ago said that this issue is with us for

257
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,320
years to come the risk that we suffer in

258
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,539
cyberspace is with us for years to come

259
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,849
this is not a job generator this is not

260
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,338
a sales pitch for technology this is the

261
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,250
reality that this domain this place

262
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,810
called cyberspace is not safe and it's

263
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,270
not likely to be safe for the kind of

264
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,699
foreseeable future and I would say that

265
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,439
that's a reality as opposed to a derp

266
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,149
right so therefore there's something we

267
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
can do to defend ourselves in this

268
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,410
domain and I'll talk a little bit about

269
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,120
that there's a wonderful website out

270
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,769
there it's called information as

271
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,320
beautiful calm you don't need to read

272
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,300
the details of this just note that every

273
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,730
bubble on this chart which essentially

274
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,649
shows breaches from present day back to

275
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,660
the dawn of time every bubble in this

276
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,459
chart represents a breach of some sort

277
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,620
if it's a large bubble it's a large

278
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:16,089
breach it's a small bubble it's a small

279
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,790
breach but there's not much white space

280
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,820
up here and frankly one of my early

281
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,589
insights in this is that if you were to

282
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,899
manipulate this as you can on that

283
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,570
website and say just show me the breach

284
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,829
is attributable to humans right take all

285
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,230
the ones off that are solely

286
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,120
attributable technology it's the same

287
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,950
chart a tiny little bubble in the upper

288
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,320
right hand corner goes away so people

289
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,690
are you know very very much implicated

290
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,480
in this plot this is a confidentiality

291
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,430
sometimes an availability issue there's

292
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,040
another chart this is a kind of

293
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,390
depiction of the world's land form you

294
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,310
know for the record I'm not a flat

295
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,079
earther despite the fact that this looks

296
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,359
like I've kind of depicted the earth is

297
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,910
flat it's just an interesting physical

298
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,040
artifact but laid over top of this is a

299
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,779
denial of service attack essentially

300
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,730
somebody hurling nerf balls at your

301
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,860
front door so that you can't get to the

302
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,050
front door illegitimate requests for

303
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,110
service I'm a denial of service attack

304
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,859
in 2012/2013 that occurred on 200

305
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:17,740
separate days so persecuted prosecuted

306
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,449
by the Iranian nation state why because

307
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,160
they were probably angry at the United

308
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,740
States and perhaps trying to take a

309
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,839
whack it's something that it found to be

310
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,269
a piece of critical infrastructure if

311
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,519
you're a red dot you're essentially I'm

312
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:32,470
hurling these nerf balls you're hurling

313
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,360
the denial of service attack if you're a

314
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,740
blue dot you're receiving them so you

315
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,970
can see a heavy concentration on the

316
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,709
East Coast and the west coast of the

317
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,420
United States but it's globally and are

318
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:42,099
connected you can see Sydney's playing a

319
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,140
role London's playing a role they're all

320
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,790
part of the victem's set if you're a

321
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,380
yellow dot you're part of the global

322
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,469
infrastructure that on a moment's notice

323
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,180
could be turned right to the attack and

324
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,130
used to become a red dot so that you can

325
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,870
hurl these these nerf balls what if I'm

326
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,939
interesting about this is a couple of

327
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,620
things one nation-state did this with

328
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,529
impunity no consequences whatsoever

329
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,180
ensued to Iran

330
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:07,499
and despite the fact that this went on

331
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,969
from August to June of 2012 2013 - it

332
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:12,300
required very little technical

333
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,649
sophistication and three and most

334
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,839
interesting of all if you look at this

335
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,879
chart it's very hard to see terrain you

336
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,920
can't see that the source of this is in

337
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,050
fact right not there's no physical

338
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,149
geography that gives you a sense based

339
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,248
upon this very accurate virtual

340
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,470
depiction no physical geography that

341
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,879
comports or essentially tracks with this

342
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,309
to say oh I can see where it's coming

343
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,379
from it's very hard to do that cyber has

344
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,230
some unique characteristics such if you

345
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,339
try to figure out who's who in the zoo

346
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,269
your experience in the physical world

347
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:44,550
doesn't do you much good next chart kind

348
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,999
of not to be outdone we had a series of

349
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,498
attacks on commercial infrastructure but

350
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,860
I don't think we're the purpose of those

351
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:55,499
attacks but I'll explain in a minute in

352
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,360
2017 and then kind of going into 2018

353
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:59,089
I'll explain that in a little bit which

354
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,470
I would describe as brazen

355
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,420
indiscriminate and hugely impactful

356
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,930
these were of course in the spring of

357
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,029
2017 in the summer of 2017 something

358
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,699
called one a cry in the spring and then

359
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,829
not Pecha in the summer one a cry was an

360
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:16,649
attack we now know by the North Korean

361
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:18,540
nation-state probably in its role as a

362
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,269
criminal enterprise but the North Korean

363
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,620
nation-state an attack called ransomware

364
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,930
which essentially if you were

365
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,000
unprotected if you had failed to patch a

366
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,489
particular variant of the Microsoft

367
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,439
operating system then they would go in

368
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,050
and kind of use this zero day

369
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:35,819
vulnerability and encrypt your data such

370
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,339
that you would then have to pay them 300

371
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,899
bitcoins to decrypt the data if it was

372
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,699
data that was critical to you say you're

373
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,040
the National Health System not making

374
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:46,079
that up UK's National Health System went

375
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,269
down hard because they hadn't actually

376
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,758
kept their inventory their state up to

377
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,860
speed and if you kind of needed your

378
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,500
data back about patient appointments

379
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,689
about prescription regimes about who

380
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,370
scheduled for surgery today the premise

381
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,439
was is it you'd read the note on your

382
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,870
screen you'd send 300 bitcoins off to

383
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,610
some account and whoever was behind that

384
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,079
screen would then send you the key turns

385
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,059
out the North Koreans were incompetent

386
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,008
they were unable right to send you the

387
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,319
key so whatever bitcoins got kind of

388
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:15,930
sent into the ether nothing ever

389
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,820
came back that was brazen crossed

390
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,979
anybody's definition of a redline it was

391
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,470
indiscriminate the UK's National Health

392
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,630
System was not the target right the

393
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,000
target was perhaps others who might

394
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,980
perhaps simply be commercial providers

395
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,450
maybe governments but you were in the

396
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,970
splash zone simply by being on the

397
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,560
network and it was impactful especially

398
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,830
if you were in the UK's national health

399
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,959
system in the summer of 2017 the

400
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,030
Russians and in their attempt to impose

401
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,640
yet another consequence on the Ukrainian

402
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,770
nation-state executed an attack called

403
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,600
not Pecha again using a zero day

404
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,210
vulnerability and kind of instrumenting

405
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,220
that in a particularly clever way went

406
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,470
into the Ukrainian government out the

407
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,810
other side to anything that was attached

408
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,650
to the Ukrainian government so Pfizer

409
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,599
Maersk global shipping line FedEx its

410
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,310
European operations all of whom were

411
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,170
operating at privileged with the

412
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,540
Ukrainian government to exchange tax

413
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,959
receipts on the fly came out the other

414
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,699
side into those kind of enterprises

415
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,280
caused upwards of about 1.8 billion

416
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,590
dollars of a meet cost but you know

417
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,810
untold reputational harm and certainly

418
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,940
some concern on can I actually trust

419
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,099
digital infrastructure anymore

420
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,510
Russian nation-state probably did that

421
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,280
because they were after the Ukraine it

422
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:35,580
was indiscriminate because it affected a

423
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,470
global marketplace so I'm going to back

424
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,440
up a little bit and then a so if that's

425
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,720
perhaps the kind of caution note that's

426
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,310
that's the kind of burning platform I'm

427
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,570
gonna say so what is it we would need to

428
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,430
get our arms around if we're gonna

429
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,860
actually create order and discipline in

430
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,390
this space whatever this space is now

431
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,070
there's one definition and I you know

432
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,840
being an air force officer or at least a

433
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,100
retired Air Force officer I could

434
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,350
actually kind of show you what this

435
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,960
means in 67 PowerPoint slides but I

436
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,210
won't do that but I'm just going to say

437
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,010
that cyberspace for many especially mere

438
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,180
mortals meant not many of whom are in

439
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,160
the room folks that are actually just

440
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,689
saying I'm not the digital native I'm an

441
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,270
app native I just want to use the darn

442
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,540
thing it's very confusing it's a it's a

443
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,760
mix it's a jumbled pipes wires data feed

444
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,069
servers routers whatever that is

445
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,630
people procedure all interleaved and

446
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,850
kind of jumbled on top of one another

447
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,220
you could tease this apart talk about

448
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,970
its constituent pieces but frankly it

449
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,670
comes down to this

450
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,709
cyberspace is this meld of Technology

451
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,579
and people and procedure alright if you

452
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,199
want to think about it from the

453
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,060
adversaries perspective if they want to

454
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,609
take advantage of something that you've

455
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,099
actually stored in cyberspace or some

456
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,110
dependency you have on cyberspace they

457
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,519
think about taking you on in three

458
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,519
dimensions right they're gonna think

459
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,199
about you can they hack you can they

460
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,519
beat you can they get you to do

461
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,199
something that maybe you know you

462
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,490
shouldn't do or something you don't know

463
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,469
is dangerous but they're essentially

464
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,970
going to come after your weakness I'm

465
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,800
second they're gonna come after your

466
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,930
procedure your doctrine your

467
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,819
expectations your assumptions your

468
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,128
hubris your arrogance that's procedure

469
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:07,410
doctrine third they're gonna come after

470
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:09,959
you using technology or sometimes using

471
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,699
a technology flaw but most of the events

472
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,619
that I look at right you can essentially

473
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,969
kind of fairly kind of say it was the

474
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,069
first two things that they took

475
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,839
advantage of if that's how an adversary

476
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:21,149
thinks of this space and an adversary

477
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,670
frankly has a more integrated view of

478
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,990
this space than any defender I've met if

479
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,339
that's how an adversary thinks of the

480
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,319
space then that might be a fair

481
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,639
definition at the hundred thousand foot

482
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,800
level of the space but that's

483
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,079
insufficient because you have to and

484
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,939
think about what the context is I've

485
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,378
just put this big red blob around that

486
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:39,389
if you can't read the bottom that

487
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,490
cyberspace that I talked about you know

488
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,290
is really difficult really challenging

489
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,449
not because of its own own

490
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,649
characteristics but because it exists

491
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,719
permanently in the presence of

492
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,540
adversaries permanently in the presence

493
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,939
of adversaries there's now a criterion

494
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,189
out for academic institutions four-year

495
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:59,490
or two-year academic institutions to

496
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:01,709
graduate kids students in the field of

497
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,689
cyber science and up front they have

498
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,730
defined what they mean by cyber science

499
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,069
as being the MELD a people procedure and

500
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,140
technology I'm kind of they used fancier

501
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,000
words than that in the presence of

502
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,709
adversaries that's really really

503
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,869
important right if you assume that the

504
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,179
system is going to be kind of installed

505
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,708
in a benevolent benign environment and

506
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,380
if therefore only needs to contend with

507
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,480
human error there perhaps in the design

508
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,789
error and its implementation but not

509
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,349
have to deal with squirrels who might

510
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:30,990
break into your kind of electrical

511
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,580
enclosure or Russian same thing who

512
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,179
perhaps try to attack you through the

513
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,100
Ukraine

514
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,710
I'm sorry I digressed in that regard

515
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,389
then then you're gonna perhaps fall

516
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,169
short in your expectations about what

517
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,429
you really need

518
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:47,100
against the strategic context kind of

519
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,840
continuing we used to say that the sins

520
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,009
and sinners in this space again thinking

521
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,269
about this from the adversaries

522
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:53,519
perspective because they had the most

523
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:55,769
holistic view we used to say that the

524
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,539
sins in this space we're typically of

525
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,580
hey I don't want somebody to steal my

526
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,399
data so I worry about confidentiality I

527
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,230
don't want somebody to disrupt my system

528
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,209
such that it is no longer available to

529
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,279
me and I certainly don't want anybody to

530
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,739
destroy the stuff that now is uniquely

531
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,799
stored in the space my bank accounts

532
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:14,940
small as they maybe are entirely

533
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,230
represented by a ones and zeros in this

534
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,539
space and so I don't want somebody to

535
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,820
kind of wipe those clean we used to say

536
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,679
that the sinners in this space were

537
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,418
criminals of course they're trying to

538
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,909
get access to this material for their

539
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,559
own get benefit nation-states for

540
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,029
various purposes we'll talk a little bit

541
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,129
more about that hacktivists nothing

542
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:33,840
better to do they've not yet encountered

543
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,070
their curfew so they're still up and

544
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,709
kind of doing some interesting things

545
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,189
and insiders who perhaps have a score to

546
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,440
settle

547
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,109
what's interesting to me is in the last

548
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,379
two years you have to add you have to

549
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:48,359
add another sin subversion down at the

550
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,459
bottom and this is different in kind

551
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,879
right than the traditional worries about

552
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,350
confidentiality integrity availability

553
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:57,059
subversion is a hack of the human being

554
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,918
to a much greater degree than a hack of

555
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,559
the three parts that you know I would

556
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,700
say comprise cyberspace subversion is

557
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,190
something and I'll explain in the next

558
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,499
slide we as a nation and other nations

559
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,230
but the United States experience richly

560
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:10,889
in the year 2016 and so what does that

561
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,690
look like

562
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,549
now this busy slide I'm going to explain

563
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,289
from the bottom up and essentially what

564
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,289
I say is that if you want to think about

565
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,299
what the Russians did to the United

566
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,960
States in terms of its election system

567
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,460
from about 2014 to 2016 despite the fact

568
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,480
that this chart says it continued to

569
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,279
2018 it did but if you look back to that

570
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,679
prior period the Russians essentially

571
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,779
came at us at three levels right first

572
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,590
and foremost the Russians used their

573
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,210
ability to hack networks people

574
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,730
procedure the Democratic National

575
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,440
Commission Committee for one they use

576
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,590
their ability to do that to steal emails

577
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,869
to perhaps garner some information they

578
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,639
use their ability to perhaps manipulate

579
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:56,039
that infrastructure to run troll

580
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:58,559
arms and to release sometimes accurate

581
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,529
sometimes inaccurate information but in

582
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,599
a tailored segmented way such that what

583
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:06,179
they did was to do things that we would

584
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,218
say at the foundational level are kind

585
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,339
of easily described as violations of

586
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:12,659
confidentiality integrity availability

587
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:15,059
and if you wanted to defend yourself

588
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,709
against that at that foundational level

589
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,450
you would say basic information

590
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,339
assurance right we need resilience we

591
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,070
need robustness perhaps resilience not

592
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,418
just in the architecture the technical

593
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,039
architecture but resilience and the

594
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,139
people right somebody should know not to

595
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,849
click on a link that you might not know

596
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,889
is from Russia but you probably know

597
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,299
doesn't have the right Providence and so

598
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,829
if you kind of then did that you say

599
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,389
let's just do basic information

600
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:38,099
assurance defend ourselves against the

601
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:39,570
Russians at that foundational level and

602
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,549
stepped back with some degree of

603
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,839
satisfaction and said done you would

604
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,190
have missed the point because the

605
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,469
Russians really weren't after the emails

606
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,450
they really care about getting bragging

607
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:51,299
rights on you know their masterful I'm

608
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,239
kind of allocation of people to troll

609
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,309
farms or the IRA the Russian Research

610
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:58,619
Institute what they're really after was

611
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,269
something more right extrapolate those

612
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,609
emails extrapolate that digital

613
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,349
infrastructure extrapolate expand what

614
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:06,718
those people were doing in the election

615
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,369
system up one level further and what the

616
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:10,679
Russians were after was the election

617
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,449
system and if you wanted to defend that

618
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,940
you need a fundamentally different

619
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,349
approach an Augmented approach not kind

620
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,759
of independent of what happens at the

621
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:20,009
foundational level but if you were to

622
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,329
defend the US election system you

623
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,070
actually need to form a collaboration

624
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,418
between 50 states and four territories

625
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,399
because that's where the voter

626
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,659
registration takes place that's where

627
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,549
the defense of the voter registration

628
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,379
takes place that's where the actual

629
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,389
election takes place it's hugely

630
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,158
distributed and delegated and so you

631
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,958
need to stand back and say ah got it

632
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,999
these guys aren't playing kind of

633
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:41,369
tic-tac-toe they're playing perhaps

634
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:43,289
checkers and so the second level need to

635
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:45,509
add something more in terms of what you

636
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,309
do but if you then with some degree of

637
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,440
satisfaction perhaps a certain degree of

638
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,879
smugness step back and fold your hands

639
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,429
since they've done right I've defended

640
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:54,748
against these guys you've missed it that

641
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:56,279
they really weren't after that at all

642
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,659
they were obtaining at a third level

643
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,489
which is the top level of this chart

644
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,739
they were after our confidence or

645
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:04,049
psychology they were after kind of the

646
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:06,059
American sense that an election system

647
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:07,080
serves their purposes what they were

648
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,360
after was not some

649
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,220
the winners but the losers of the

650
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,719
election to say that the losers get up

651
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,760
the day after and say I'm not sure I

652
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,220
believe the result I'm not sure that I'm

653
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,200
confident that this this system serves

654
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,669
the American people and therefore

655
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,159
there's some degree of internal

656
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,570
dissension contention conflict that's

657
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,460
generated because of the lack of

658
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,559
confidence in this underpinning digital

659
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,029
infrastructure that's the level that the

660
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,309
Russians are playing at and in order to

661
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,899
essentially beat that game you need to

662
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,309
think at all three levels they're not

663
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,719
playing tic-tac-toe they're not playing

664
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,399
they're not playing checkers they're

665
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,130
playing three-dimensional chess or kind

666
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,178
of in the extreme they're playing go and

667
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,440
so what do we do about that

668
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,330
well first I'm going to step back and

669
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,789
say so so what are the conventional

670
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,158
wisdom associated with either you know

671
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,870
how the space operates or the things

672
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,850
that we do to defend ourselves in that

673
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,309
space and so busy a little chart I'll

674
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,699
walk you through this but thoughts on I

675
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,740
skip a chart nope I've got it first I'll

676
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,630
just let me back up I did skip this

677
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,190
chart say a little bit about this now

678
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,830
this I think falls out of what I've said

679
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,570
so far but the overlays in terms of you

680
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,879
stand back and say well you know what is

681
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,918
happening in the space most folks would

682
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,529
see this in Knox inexorable on rush of

683
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,090
Technology I have an iPhone 8 because I

684
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,740
haven't yet paid for it right so I'm

685
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,658
still paying month by month I probably

686
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,010
have another year to go on that I think

687
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,419
there's an iPhone 10 out there I don't

688
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,908
actually read the ads because I don't

689
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,039
want to cry right and so I think about

690
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:31,289
this inexorable onrush of the devices

691
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,850
and the apps and all that stuff but

692
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:34,919
frankly that's not the pacing function

693
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,459
in this space the pacing function is

694
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,809
four things one there is a new geography

695
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,399
unreconciled to the old right think

696
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,990
about how people who actually are

697
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,850
successful in using digital

698
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,139
infrastructure think about geography

699
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,969
they don't think about physical

700
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,830
jurisdictions right they think about

701
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,139
this boundary list world now you know

702
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,820
that to a fairly well but unless you

703
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,830
understand that new geography you're

704
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,658
going to be condemned right to

705
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,370
essentially operate at the speed of the

706
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,350
old geography I don't think I need to

707
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,268
say more we have medicines alongside

708
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,219
citizens my clever way of saying that

709
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,580
people increasingly have a propensity to

710
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,230
organize not by physical proximity right

711
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,970
so somebody told me earlier they're born

712
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,809
and raised in this kind of city and

713
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,490
therefore they thought there was one

714
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,500
college in the world they went to Purdue

715
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,750
right now that's probably exactly the

716
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,580
right answer no matter where you

717
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,320
on the planet Earth but it's probably

718
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,850
also because of some degree of physical

719
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,080
proximity you kind of send what that's

720
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,240
the school that's where I'm gonna go

721
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,300
right people now have an opportunity to

722
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,550
organize by ideology across these broad

723
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,000
networks that can either inspire or

724
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:37,040
connect or radicalize them and in turn

725
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,750
they have an equal opportunity to reach

726
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,540
out and do that across these networks

727
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,520
without regard to physical proximity in

728
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,040
the physical world we worry about that

729
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,810
phenomenon as a kind of source of lone

730
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,670
wolf terrorists people who get up and

731
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,889
San Bernardino California one day and

732
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,450
kill their fellow citizens when they

733
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,340
would look back at that person said but

734
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,870
you're one of us we've lived alongside

735
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,679
each other we play softball together

736
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,300
right this issue of kind of something

737
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,130
sometimes wonderful I'm kind of think of

738
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,820
to hear square in terms of the Arab

739
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,280
Spring

740
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,290
sometimes insidious um you know is a

741
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,330
prospect that we need to think our way

742
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,310
through of how do we make sure that it

743
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,470
is the former it's inspiring and not the

744
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,389
latter insidious disparity in jurors

745
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,190
that's the third phenomenon no big

746
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,800
surprise there people out a lot of money

747
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,810
and people who don't people who then try

748
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,879
to either collaborate or compete or

749
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,040
conflict right to reconcile that

750
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,470
discrepancy increasingly use cyberspace

751
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,120
to do that now that is not simply kind

752
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,800
of restricted to money there sometimes

753
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,300
the difference in religious right

754
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,850
respect there sometimes the difference

755
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,440
in geopolitical respect but cyberspace

756
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,179
increasingly is the venue where those

757
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,550
reconciliations take place and finally

758
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,900
geopolitics continues a pace that

759
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,790
Russian example I gave that's

760
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,590
geopolitics playing out that North

761
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,780
Korean example I gave geopolitics

762
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,240
playing out the Iranians geopolitics

763
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,030
playing out and while the sinners still

764
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,560
are in quantity quantity order right the

765
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,899
criminals the nation-states the

766
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,460
hacktivist and the insiders increasingly

767
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,350
the one that's jumping off the chart in

768
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,080
terms of having an enormous consequence

769
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:10,310
are the nation states I'm so now to

770
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,740
these next two slides this clicker is

771
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,659
very eager to please I must say so

772
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,100
conventional wisdom let me just walk

773
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,690
down conventional wisdom we used to

774
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,240
think that the hazards in the space were

775
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,590
the big three that I talked about

776
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,750
disruption destruction we used to think

777
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,429
that threat paced the risk what's that

778
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,020
mean meaning that you didn't defend

779
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,880
yourself against something until you

780
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,129
knew that something or someone was

781
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,350
actually trying to do it

782
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,330
you write that there was some kind of

783
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,459
presence there was some life force it

784
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,020
was actually after you we used to think

785
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,150
that cyber was an information technology

786
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,040
issues like the motor pool just make the

787
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,960
darn thing work would you because I have

788
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,399
things to do I've got an operation to

789
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,930
conduct over here meanwhile those

790
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,880
operators are the ones taking all the

791
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,530
risk the poor technologists have no idea

792
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,400
what the risks are but I'll say more

793
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,020
about that in a minute

794
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,220
we used to think there are clean lines

795
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,290
between the criminal and the

796
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,700
nation-state north Korea has actually

797
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,800
blown that right out of the water

798
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,360
Russia too we used to think the private

799
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,850
sector was on the front lines and could

800
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,020
handle it that's still partially true we

801
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,570
used to think of the government as a

802
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,100
regulator or a defender asynchronously

803
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,300
right didn't you didn't really know

804
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,830
which version of the government was

805
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,149
going to show up I was actually in the

806
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,470
White House when the Iranians were

807
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,650
attacking I was on the National Security

808
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:19,660
Council as a kind of deputy at NSA when

809
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,490
the Iranians were attacking um you know

810
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,060
US financial infrastructure day after

811
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,710
day after day across 2012-2013 save you

812
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,210
the long interesting story about how the

813
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,740
government came to its conclusions about

814
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,570
what it would or wouldn't do but there

815
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,310
was a moment in time when the chair of a

816
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,919
meeting chair of the National Security

817
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,929
Council said so what are your industry

818
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,850
what are your commercial private sector

819
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,590
counterparts telling you went down one

820
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,629
side of the table right the folks that

821
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,310
typically represented the regulatory

822
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,600
component of government and each and

823
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,830
every one of them said we've talked to

824
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,120
the private sector they're fine they

825
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,340
don't need our help thank you very much

826
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,840
tis but a scratch went down the other

827
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,909
side of the table which typically

828
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,770
provided advice counsel meaningful

829
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,210
support right to the private sector had

830
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,810
no regulatory function what's that

831
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,850
whatsoever

832
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,200
and all of them said they're dying out

833
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,639
there they wonder why we're not kind of

834
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,260
standing in why we're not helping them

835
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,660
why we're not defending the private

836
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,310
sector against a nation-state because

837
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,870
the first side of that was the

838
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,490
regulator's when they showed up right

839
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,500
you cut it through wet blanket on you

840
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,540
and second side would bring fire hoses

841
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,460
right in those two faces of government

842
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,100
which you couldn't predict which was

843
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,200
which made it such in the old days right

844
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,550
that this was a crapshoot as to whether

845
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,760
you would tell the government I've got a

846
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:30,100
problem so now I would say that kind of

847
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,290
now in future I'm to those three risks

848
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,659
add subversion it's a big deal and you

849
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,520
defend yourself against subversion in a

850
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,230
way that's different it's an extension

851
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,750
of how you might defend yourself against

852
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,550
the first three as opposed to threat

853
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,720
being the thing that then paces your

854
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,070
sense of risk

855
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,510
creasing Li it should be vulnerability

856
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,730
what do we mean by that I mean if you

857
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,590
have some latent vulnerability even if

858
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,030
nobody in the world knows about it even

859
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,129
if nobody in the world do you think

860
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,870
would take advantage of it you better

861
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,789
think about defending yourself against

862
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,918
that because it's movement from a

863
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:02,169
vulnerability to a risk could occur in

864
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,690
hours time right and you're not

865
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:07,360
necessarily going to be the target if

866
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,919
you're the victim we used to think that

867
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,539
cyber was just an information technology

868
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,370
issue it's an operational issue

869
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,890
it's the operators who take the risk and

870
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,168
this is fundamentally a primary business

871
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,610
function not a technology function that

872
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,630
if it doesn't work you just do your

873
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,459
business some other way

874
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,020
criminal lie or lines between the

875
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,090
criminal and states blurring in some

876
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,408
cases is completely over left the

877
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,418
private sector is still on the front

878
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,490
lines it can't handle all of that if you

879
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,840
ask Maersk if you ask FedEx if you ask

880
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,370
Pfizer if you ask any number of other

881
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,620
companies that have experienced some of

882
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,360
these near existential threats they

883
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,039
would say look we believe that we've got

884
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,990
to do everything we can to create

885
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,370
resilience to understand what's then

886
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,169
happening on top of that digital

887
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,658
infrastructure so cognizance real-time

888
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,490
situational awareness and frankly to

889
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,860
muster some resources necessary to

890
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,360
respond and recover but we can't prevail

891
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,860
against the nation-state there are

892
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,500
certain things we just can't bring to

893
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,120
bear we can't issued diplomatic de

894
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,640
marshes we can't go to the United

895
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,229
Nations we can't mobilize an army if you

896
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,789
ever wanted to do that we can't do

897
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,070
criminal prosecution we can't do

898
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:07,690
financial sanctions so the private

899
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,700
sector is increasingly saying we need a

900
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,890
partnership and then finally the

901
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,200
government needs to step in as partner

902
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,000
regulator defender concurrently it needs

903
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,429
to lead with its most benign benevolent

904
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,510
face as opposed to perhaps it's kind of

905
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:27,159
nasty cost imposing face thoughts on

906
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,570
practice we used to think that

907
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,820
prevention was king let's defend the

908
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,500
chokepoints right so now kind of the

909
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,750
detection and perhaps suppression of

910
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,789
malware that's still important but but

911
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,320
if that's your sense that I can catch

912
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:40,480
this that the choke points and the core

913
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,178
is safe then you're about 10 years out

914
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,500
of date right detect and react used to

915
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:46,360
be thought of as viable strategy many

916
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,280
cases it still is the strategy of hey

917
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,110
I'm gonna stand back and inside my

918
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,090
perimeter or whatever that might be I'll

919
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,500
just detect right the incoming arrows

920
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,500
and I'll run around I'll gather them all

921
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,210
up I'll defend in depth

922
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,610
as opposed to having some foreknowledge

923
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,770
of what this bad looked like and can I

924
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,719
perhaps take it out at a place well

925
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,100
outside my perimeter now having said

926
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,840
that I could see some eyebrows go up but

927
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,760
we can't actually hack back as the

928
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,500
private sector that's true but we need

929
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,390
to have some cognizance of what's out

930
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,370
there to a greater degree and then we

931
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,809
might be allowed if we simply patrol

932
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,949
their own internal networks I'll say

933
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,720
more about that in a second

934
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,159
the economics favor the adversary

935
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,919
meaning they get to choose the time the

936
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,450
place they don't play by the rules

937
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,030
adversary owns audacity and maneuver

938
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,500
initiative is there's the private sector

939
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,470
and the government fight alone they

940
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,270
fight in their silos you defend a I will

941
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,490
defend B and we'll just meet at the

942
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,840
scene turns out that's what's called a

943
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,210
division of effort that's actually an

944
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,149
agreement to not collaborate it's hugely

945
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,980
hugely injurious and then finally we

946
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,630
share at human speed most of the ice ax

947
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,490
the information sharing and analysis

948
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,289
centers which are set up with the 16

949
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,470
critical infrastructures most of them

950
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:54,299
today share at human speed at best and

951
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,890
occasionally an email comes across tor

952
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,059
there's a quarterly meeting where they

953
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,320
get together and say hey what are our

954
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,210
best practices how do we actually

955
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,129
compare and contrast those things the

956
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,630
financial sector has stepped way out and

957
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,490
they have this thing called the FS arc

958
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,809
the analysis Research Center where

959
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,850
they're trying to share it machine speed

960
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,168
but it's only the big few right who can

961
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,520
afford to participate in that

962
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,470
financially afford to participate that

963
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,970
that are doing it and therefore we're

964
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,549
still perhaps not in the right place on

965
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,830
that the future we need to defend the

966
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,929
court and the data and we need to do

967
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,340
that continuously we need to actually

968
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,950
understand that these systems are not

969
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,629
secure they are at best defensible right

970
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,710
and therefore we need to have a constant

971
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,780
understanding of how they're being

972
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,010
employed and used and if data is the

973
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,110
embodiment of your wealth and treasure

974
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,510
defend that as much or more as the

975
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,830
artifacts that contain that data

976
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,140
continuous situational required our

977
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:42,090
awareness is required we must attack the

978
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,530
adversary economics if an adversary can

979
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,330
hold us at risk for pennies on the

980
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,678
dollar we need to turn that around and

981
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,149
make it such that it's going to cost

982
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,730
them dollars to hold pennies at risk

983
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,159
I'll explain in a minute the defense

984
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,110
perhaps needs to steal audacity back

985
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,700
from the adversary I'm give a dynamic

986
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,229
face make it such that the adversary is

987
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,390
trying to guess what you're up to what

988
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,490
you're doing where your stuff is perhaps

989
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,500
put them on the kind of back foot in

990
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,090
terms of under trying to understand how

991
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,130
have you actually arrayed your defenses

992
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,649
that has a rich and storied history and

993
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,390
the fizz

994
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,670
we need to bring that into the virtual

995
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,800
world we need to have a collaborative

996
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,330
application of diverse Authority I'm

997
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,399
often asked the question especially in

998
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:20,020
testimony like who's in charge of

999
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,370
cyberspace right so you gotta put your

1000
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,840
hands on your hips say it just that way

1001
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,489
it said about six feet tall with big

1002
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,020
lights shining behind you who's in

1003
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,150
charge in cyberspace which essentially

1004
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,420
says who is the one neck that I'm gonna

1005
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,190
grab in order to say you let this happen

1006
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,570
that's actually a decent question in the

1007
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,070
time of a crisis like who's going to

1008
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,179
step into the room and allocate the task

1009
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,560
and say this is what we're gonna do

1010
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,240
right this is how we're going to

1011
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,980
synchronize the results but in the day

1012
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,330
to day Royal the day to day steady state

1013
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,340
of cyberspace it's a really dumb

1014
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,899
question right maybe there are no stupid

1015
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,550
questions but there are dumb questions

1016
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,770
that's a dumb question now think about

1017
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,750
the physical world right now I parked

1018
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,820
just across the street right that way

1019
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,680
just across the street I locked my car

1020
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,120
not because I don't trust Purdue but

1021
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,160
because I know that I have a meaningful

1022
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,919
role to play my own security and that if

1023
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,750
my car was kind of ransacked somebody

1024
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,130
reached in stole the radio Avis would

1025
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,270
say that's your fault because you didn't

1026
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,980
lock the car you left the keys on the

1027
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,870
dashboard why because I'd never forget

1028
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,429
where they are that's just stupid if

1029
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,259
you're an individual so I participated

1030
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:16,000
in that security there are police on

1031
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,440
campus that make sure the people from

1032
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,889
the University of Michigan or others

1033
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,690
kind of repel that you know first sight

1034
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,310
they kind of navigate to make sure that

1035
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,090
order and discipline kind of you know it

1036
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,880
was on the streets

1037
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,220
I'll bet Indiana has a national guard in

1038
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,230
case Ohio attacks you so you can kind of

1039
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,509
push back we're in a time of crisis you

1040
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,310
can help right respond to a disaster um

1041
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,169
TSA is gonna meet me at the airport this

1042
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,699
afternoon to make sure I as a

1043
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,799
prospective terrorist and not a

1044
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,540
prospective terrorists meanwhile I'm out

1045
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,220
in Colorado in the North American Air

1046
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,960
Defense Command is scanning for missiles

1047
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,370
coming out of North Korea and if one

1048
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,080
comes out of there they'll shoot it down

1049
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,819
meanwhile somebody's guarding the

1050
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,860
harbors the ports there's an army that's

1051
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,840
essentially kind of operating abroad to

1052
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,100
defend forward you know how all that

1053
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,020
works what's really interesting about

1054
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,480
that is that they all do their work

1055
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,850
concurrently with some degree of natural

1056
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,260
right synergy now but they don't consult

1057
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,850
with one another before they shoot the

1058
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,560
three-stage missile down or before they

1059
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,029
kind of prevent a terrorist in getting

1060
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,500
on board the individuals the

1061
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,450
organization's the private sector the

1062
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,700
public sector is all figured out how to

1063
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,040
do this collaboration kind of line

1064
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,810
abreast side by side by side won't have

1065
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,570
anything approaching that for cyberspace

1066
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,040
at the moment and yet we must

1067
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,480
and then finally sharing Atmos teen

1068
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,620
speed that's the only way to stay up

1069
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,260
with this we have to figure out how do

1070
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,240
we routinize automate right kind of use

1071
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,740
heuristics bordering on analytics

1072
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,600
bordering on artificial intelligence

1073
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,339
which is still oversold but I think it's

1074
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,779
getting closer how do we use that to

1075
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,150
essentially aid and abet our efforts in

1076
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,700
this space so way forward not

1077
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,110
surprisingly strategy should be our

1078
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,270
guide right we shouldn't just kind of

1079
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,190
respond right ad hoc or perhaps

1080
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,450
heuristic lis we should say what is it

1081
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,770
we're trying to do and we should

1082
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,750
therefore say we're going to array our

1083
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,460
resources to do that in a prioritized

1084
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,310
manner we're not going to be to defend

1085
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,180
all things against all perils

1086
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,490
foundational capabilities not

1087
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,169
surprisingly will be a Goff's technology

1088
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,910
people and procedure roles and

1089
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,460
responsibilities will be really really

1090
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,890
important in this so what remains right

1091
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,470
so here's my pithy kind of 50,000 foot

1092
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,509
level of here's a national strategy now

1093
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,399
I'm gonna kind of offer this up to the

1094
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,110
panels Commission's that I'm on may or

1095
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,220
may not be accepted but I think

1096
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,860
holistically it looks something like

1097
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,660
this basic security theory still matters

1098
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,030
I'll show a chart as to what I mean by

1099
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,859
that relentless pursuit of innovation

1100
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,600
automatisation automation routinization

1101
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,880
there's a lot of that in this room and

1102
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,520
we need to take full advantage of it we

1103
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,990
need to essentially out innovate out of

1104
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,210
collaborate right our adversaries in

1105
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,919
this space policy and doctrine we need

1106
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,960
to get the roles and responsibilities

1107
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,240
right and it needs to respect the true

1108
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,830
nature of cyberspace as opposed to just

1109
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,680
dragging those things that might have

1110
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,490
used in other domains along with us

1111
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,129
concurrency and collaboration or

1112
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,649
required division of effort is a siren

1113
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,720
on the rocks right and it simply react

1114
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,210
right kind of detect and react strategy

1115
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,370
that's a disaster right audacity works

1116
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,620
both ways we need to take take on the

1117
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,299
adversaries in this space and then

1118
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,859
professionalism matters education and

1119
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,360
career tracks it is noteworthy that

1120
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,220
we're kind of having this discussion on

1121
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,840
the Purdue campus and I'll talk a little

1122
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,149
bit about that I will talk about that

1123
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,700
and the basic security theory and not

1124
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,340
bore you with all the rest so what's the

1125
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,080
basic security that look like so for

1126
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,030
those of you who kind of had any kind of

1127
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,160
schooling or professional grounding and

1128
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,870
the nuclear strategy of how do you

1129
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,580
determine series in a world where

1130
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,980
nuclear weapons are the existential

1131
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,360
threat this might be familiar and so I'm

1132
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,790
going to lift and shift that a little

1133
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,350
bit and and having said that it doesn't

1134
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,710
work completely because if you're in the

1135
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,589
nuke

1136
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,660
right when the offense shows up its game

1137
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,490
over its offense dominate when you're in

1138
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,589
the cyber world its offense persistent

1139
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,328
the offense is always on the field the

1140
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:49,089
adversary is always on the field well

1141
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:51,010
that's kind of a dumb human being who's

1142
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,599
not using the system properly well it's

1143
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,250
a squirrel that's chewing your Ethernet

1144
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,559
cable or whether it's a Russian is

1145
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,630
actually trying to do some real harm so

1146
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,950
here's the strategy I'm gonna start from

1147
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,030
the bottom and there's the distinction

1148
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,189
between the green and the red

1149
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,900
at the bottom you have to actually say

1150
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,910
kind of what's your strategy what's

1151
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,680
important to you what matters to you you

1152
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,420
have to actually do some thinking ask

1153
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,770
most companies about what's the most

1154
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,329
important day you have on the system

1155
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,579
they break eye contact they look away

1156
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:17,200
right I don't know what's on the system

1157
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:19,180
that stuff is on the system I'm gonna

1158
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,558
defend it all that's insane right need

1159
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,299
to know what it is that's on the system

1160
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,740
what are you defending and with what

1161
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,660
degree of investment are you willing to

1162
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,098
do that you then need to declare those

1163
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,868
priorities so the people that are

1164
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,880
actually defending the system or the

1165
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,530
people holding that at risk understand

1166
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,300
those priorities and they therefore are

1167
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,309
properly advised as to what investments

1168
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,140
they should make or perhaps what

1169
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:40,780
consequences will ensue if they take

1170
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,339
that on we very seldom do those first

1171
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,829
two layers but without those two

1172
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:46,270
foundational layers the rest you're just

1173
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,430
kind of running around practicing

1174
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,349
Brownian motion we need to actually do

1175
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,450
traditional information assurance that's

1176
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:54,790
the third level inherent robustness and

1177
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,290
resilient make the network which is

1178
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,240
comprised of technology and people and

1179
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,220
procedure invest in the people as well

1180
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,990
make that such that it's naturally

1181
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,939
resilient and robust it's never going to

1182
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,740
be secure that's a different goal and

1183
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,299
that's that's perhaps you know the

1184
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,129
that's Annie and the curve that if you

1185
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:10,299
go another five percent beyond that

1186
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,339
you'll look spend ninety percent of your

1187
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:14,049
money but material doctrine and people

1188
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:16,808
should be kind of an investment area

1189
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:18,640
then I'm having created a defensible

1190
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,440
architecture the top most green layer

1191
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,690
need to actually understand how it's

1192
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,849
being employed really employed right

1193
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,230
that's about cognizance vigilance that's

1194
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:28,720
better understanding what the life

1195
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,819
forces are on your system I'm amazed at

1196
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,160
how many companies or for that matter

1197
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:34,690
public sector organizations they do the

1198
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,670
first three with some reasonable

1199
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,710
facility and then they assume that the

1200
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,599
network will defend itself they

1201
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,490
therefore don't actually apply the human

1202
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,109
component of how do I understand what

1203
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,598
the state of the network is its eternal

1204
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:48,490
deficiencies playing out therefore they

1205
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,119
don't do that topmost green level and

1206
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,319
there

1207
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,119
Jacque stunned and amazed when they come

1208
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,859
back in on Monday having left on Friday

1209
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,170
and the network didn't defend itself

1210
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:58,538
it won't now I'm going to get into the

1211
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,880
red space I'm so the active defense the

1212
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,640
local close in fight if an adversary

1213
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,519
says your resilience isn't enough your

1214
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,259
deterrence by denial isn't enough you've

1215
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,269
kind of denying me my opportunity to

1216
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:11,980
essentially have my way with you if they

1217
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:13,660
still come at you you need to be

1218
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,339
prepared to essentially repel boarders

1219
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,859
you need to be prepared to essentially

1220
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:19,210
engage in that close-in fight that gets

1221
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:21,339
a little dangerous in terms of

1222
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,950
authorities because by law within the

1223
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:24,940
United States and like-minded nations

1224
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,980
organizations aren't allowed to operate

1225
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,839
outside right those kind of

1226
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,109
jurisdictions that they physically own

1227
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:33,430
or have leased rights to operate and

1228
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:35,380
therefore there needs to be some

1229
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,379
application of inherently governmental

1230
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,970
authority or adjacent Authority but but

1231
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,249
you can't do this by yourself you

1232
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,299
actually have to be in a collaboration

1233
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:45,220
ultimately I think not just between

1234
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:47,079
private and private but between private

1235
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,759
and public private and government to

1236
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,499
essentially bring those tools to bear

1237
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:51,970
and then finally right if you've got an

1238
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:53,499
adversary that's still coming at you

1239
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,390
they said look your your inherent

1240
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:57,160
resilience isn't enough you're kind of

1241
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,690
pushing me off at the perimeter or just

1242
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,670
outside the perimeter isn't enough I'm

1243
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,589
still coming at you need to be able to

1244
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,119
go and impose consequences on them now

1245
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:06,009
this isn't necessarily just in

1246
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,630
cyberspace it could be that the

1247
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:09,549
consequence you impose as a financial

1248
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,140
sanction could be that you just shame

1249
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:13,509
them a lot of the country's doing this

1250
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,430
or not Shaima 'but give it a whirl it

1251
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:17,200
might be that you essentially criminally

1252
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,390
indict them might be that you kind of

1253
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,700
arrest and extradite them you need to

1254
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,019
bring that power to bear as well here's

1255
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,308
here's though kind of something I think

1256
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:26,558
is really important about this this is

1257
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,999
hierarchical if you're engaging in the

1258
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,369
red stuff before you've done the green

1259
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:31,930
stuff shame on you right a it won't

1260
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:34,059
succeed and be you're reckless

1261
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,069
right you're swinging a baseball bat in

1262
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,539
a small dark room with lots of China in

1263
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:39,009
it and therefore you need to do the

1264
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:43,390
foundational stuff work your way from

1265
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:45,009
the bottom to the top to depend in

1266
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,078
hierarchical layers but you need to work

1267
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:48,819
up on the bottom-up - this is a whole of

1268
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,410
society approach this is not a pitch to

1269
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:51,910
the government what it should do or a

1270
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,618
pitch to some private individual what

1271
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,180
you should do rather it begins to

1272
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:57,160
describe what might be the kind of

1273
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,558
engagement of all of these instruments

1274
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,259
of power in a collaborative side by side

1275
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,870
manner and frankly these things all have

1276
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:05,060
to be done

1277
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:08,299
currently again though with some sense

1278
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,070
of what the hierarchy is now the basic

1279
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,050
security theory that's in the background

1280
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,940
now I'm still mattering there is an

1281
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,740
expectation that not just this grand

1282
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,630
strategy plays out but that everybody

1283
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,819
does their bit right I locked my car

1284
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,770
right I didn't put my iPad on the dash

1285
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,050
didn't leave my keys on the dash I did

1286
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,670
some basic kind of local work so that I

1287
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,950
could participate in the physical

1288
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,390
defense of this realm you know there's

1289
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,549
something called the National Institute

1290
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,140
of Standards technology framework it

1291
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,210
asked some pretty simple questions of

1292
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,040
have you identified upper right quadrant

1293
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,970
have you identified the assets that are

1294
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,800
valuable to you

1295
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,109
have you taken measures to protect them

1296
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,030
information assurance I've you've got

1297
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,440
the ability to detect anomalies on your

1298
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,180
system do you have the ability to

1299
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,100
respond and do you have the ability to

1300
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,480
recover can you actually work your way

1301
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,410
through when the system is not operating

1302
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,910
in perfect sense in that virtuous cycle

1303
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,069
but that continuous cycle really

1304
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,529
concurrent phases there's an expectation

1305
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,750
that individuals private organizations

1306
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,270
government will do those sorts of things

1307
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,920
as their contribution to the fray right

1308
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,720
and so kind of take that kind of grand

1309
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,120
strategy on the first slide at it with

1310
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,680
this expectation of local diligence and

1311
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,960
you get something that says this just

1312
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:19,399
might make for a defensible right kind

1313
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,540
of space but defensible realm the other

1314
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,070
things that I said was that

1315
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,020
collaboration and concurrency are

1316
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,640
required I think that that concurrency

1317
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,590
that collaboration needs to be between

1318
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,180
the private sector the government sector

1319
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,370
the lotu circles and it needs to be done

1320
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,779
in an international context I'm on the

1321
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,060
board of directors of the FedEx

1322
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,940
Corporation we operate in 220 countries

1323
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,350
we have 450,000 employees I'm not sure

1324
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,170
what the exact number is but probably

1325
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:45,020
maybe a third or maybe a half of those

1326
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,430
at most are US citizens right and that

1327
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,090
geography that we operate across

1328
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,470
requires us to operate in a coalition

1329
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:54,260
attending to the values of our kind of

1330
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,060
parent country but consistent with the

1331
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,480
expectations and values of all those

1332
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,480
countries

1333
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:10,619
oh I'll be familiar with this by the

1334
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,809
time I'm done there we go

1335
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,240
now I called out a particular role for

1336
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:16,770
the government and because I think the

1337
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,390
government is underrepresented in terms

1338
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,430
of making a full and fair contribution

1339
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,900
to this mix and I'm not going to

1340
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,089
describe the government's first role as

1341
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,890
being one of a regulatory nature or

1342
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:28,049
perhaps imposing cost the government

1343
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,000
sometimes walks into a bank that's just

1344
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,710
been robbed and slaps the teller right

1345
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,849
that that's not appropriate right what

1346
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,380
the government needs to do is to figure

1347
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:35,790
out what are it's beneficial components

1348
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,160
and leave with those and I've got those

1349
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,410
here in this order first the government

1350
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,299
has a bully pulpit right it can serve as

1351
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:44,069
a promoter it can serve as someone who

1352
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,470
shapes opinion or something shaping

1353
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:48,180
opinion lead by example kind of practice

1354
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,339
it at home such that it then might be

1355
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,259
I'm kind of something others do it can

1356
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:53,940
facilitate it can facilitate either by

1357
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,680
using that bully pulpit or can

1358
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,680
facilitate by perhaps creating

1359
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,690
incentives I'm for liabilities or by

1360
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,069
creating venues or permissions for the

1361
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,950
private sector where most of the

1362
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:07,500
innovative capacity lives at least 90 95

1363
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,509
percent and most of the kind of build

1364
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,160
operate and sustain lives but the

1365
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,319
government can help in that regard

1366
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,230
right there's still a concern not just

1367
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,509
within sectors say the financial sector

1368
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,549
or the electrical sector but especially

1369
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,440
a concern across sectors that we're not

1370
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,240
allowed to share that if we were to

1371
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,099
share some sense as to what cyber threat

1372
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,049
we faced that a tort lawyer would come

1373
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,630
flying out of a closet and sue me or

1374
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:32,549
perhaps my shareholders would sue me and

1375
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,010
therefore were somewhat discreet about

1376
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:36,509
sharing the true kind of fine-grained

1377
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,950
knowledge about what transpired and

1378
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,829
therefore we let somebody else suffer

1379
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,808
this before we do the government can be

1380
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:43,829
a contributor right so there's something

1381
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,960
that the Department of Homeland Security

1382
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:48,089
just stood up called the cyber security

1383
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,710
and infrastructure security agency and

1384
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:51,150
it now is trying to lean forward in the

1385
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,130
straps and say how do I actually take

1386
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,690
government acquired information maybe

1387
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,730
it's from the National Security Agency

1388
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,349
kind of operating as it should right

1389
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,480
abroad trying to figure out what the

1390
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,859
threats are kind of broadly or maybe

1391
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,630
taking the National Security Agency's

1392
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,670
best practices because it's fundamental

1393
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,710
role is to discover vulnerabilities take

1394
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,960
those best practices and convey them to

1395
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,579
the private sector contribute to the

1396
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,960
advance of knowledge in the private

1397
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,430
sector it's not going to be the bulwark

1398
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,910
but it's going to make an important

1399
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,440
contribution

1400
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,390
it could be a co-conspirator and

1401
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,250
threaten identification and medication I

1402
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,440
use that kind of with tongue-in-cheek

1403
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,390
it can be a collaborator in that now the

1404
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,880
UK the United Kingdom I think has this

1405
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,279
exactly right in the United States we

1406
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,410
have this huge issue of if a private

1407
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,420
organization discovers something it's

1408
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,950
probably proprietary because it's

1409
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,780
attached to their kind of digital

1410
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,970
infrastructure or if the government

1411
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,720
discovers something that's shareable or

1412
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,339
should be shared

1413
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,589
there's probably classified because by

1414
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,210
the time it crossed that threshold there

1415
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,730
are kind of unique sources and methods

1416
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,140
in that and probably tracks back to the

1417
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,330
intelligence community or something else

1418
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,710
and at this moment what you have is this

1419
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,509
challenge of how do I get this

1420
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,820
information inside a proprietary or

1421
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:59,590
classified I don't have it cross over

1422
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,270
such that it can benefit all God's

1423
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,250
creatures right and and then the

1424
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,440
sanitization process takes place which

1425
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,420
any of you who familiar with that can go

1426
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,520
months two years you know by which time

1427
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,290
the technology that it's attributable to

1428
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,850
is in the Smithsonian and so you wonder

1429
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,170
why did you spend the last year kind of

1430
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,150
taking this thing across the finish line

1431
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,530
the Brits have essentially reversed that

1432
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,360
process what they've taught is to say

1433
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,670
maybe we should collaborate at the

1434
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,130
lowest possible level not at the highest

1435
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,780
possible level not at the strategic

1436
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,920
level but rather down here whether nuts

1437
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,440
and bolts take place so what they've

1438
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,270
done is they've taken 650 of their

1439
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,840
version of NSA that's a lot of people

1440
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:37,030
for them that's probably 1012 percent of

1441
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,800
their entire kind of NSA equivalent work

1442
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,180
force they've taken them and they put

1443
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,130
them in a place where natural light

1444
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,470
streams in right so they'll operate in

1445
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:46,480
an unclassified environment alongside

1446
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,069
about a hundred and fifty members of the

1447
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,360
private sector and what they do all day

1448
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,430
every day is they discover

1449
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,140
vulnerabilities and then begin to

1450
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,049
mitigate those vulnerabilities across

1451
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,549
kind of private and public networks such

1452
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,250
that if they have a common understanding

1453
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,440
it's not already proprietary or

1454
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,180
classified it can then off that floor

1455
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,680
that they're operating on inform the

1456
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,089
work of hundreds of thousands of people

1457
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,069
who kind of sit back in those stove

1458
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,450
pipes and the collaboration having been

1459
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,090
affected at the lowest possible level

1460
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,770
stay strong right intertwined as you

1461
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,420
move up the pipe it actually works

1462
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:18,759
they've been in business now for two

1463
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,710
years right they put out a report a year

1464
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,970
ago which I kind of read stem to stern I

1465
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,440
think they've just put out their second

1466
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,509
report but the first one had a

1467
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,820
meaningful and significant decrease

1468
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,470
right in at least the quantity if not

1469
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,020
the effect the impact

1470
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,270
of threats that exist broadly across

1471
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,490
these public and private networks right

1472
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,839
so that's hugely effective and then

1473
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,368
finally down at the bottom this is

1474
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,960
essentially a reverse of the chart I

1475
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:43,060
showed you before which had from green

1476
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,880
to red you know top the bottom I'm down

1477
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,560
at the bottom I've got active defense

1478
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,910
meaning that if there's an adversary

1479
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,819
that still comes at you if Russia

1480
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:54,819
attempts to influence our elections in

1481
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:56,710
2018 over our shoulder or in 2020 if

1482
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:58,540
they're still doing that then then we

1483
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,369
can't just stand on shore and catch the

1484
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,140
arrows run around saying we'll just try

1485
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,520
to actually kind of endeavor to

1486
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,470
persevere we're gonna do the Monty

1487
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,839
Python routine it's just a scratch you

1488
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,209
can't really hurt me so I still have you

1489
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,560
know kind of my kind of corporal body we

1490
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,089
have to actually go forward we have to

1491
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,349
go forward and necessarily knock the

1492
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:16,480
stilts out from underneath that and

1493
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,460
declare that if you kind of are arraying

1494
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,430
an offense against me that in an

1495
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,290
appropriate response to that a defensive

1496
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,129
response to that is to defend forward

1497
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,569
and that's in fact going on as we speak

1498
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,010
kind of at the practical level if you're

1499
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:31,779
a technologist in the room which

1500
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,819
everybody's making eye contact now

1501
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,770
there's a set of things you would do to

1502
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:38,290
essentially affect basic information

1503
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,790
current defensible systems actually

1504
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,050
defend the system and prepare for

1505
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,150
disaster so that you can power through

1506
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,440
it I have grayed out most of that since

1507
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,089
I don't want to kind of be preaching to

1508
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,339
the choir especially one perhaps I'm a

1509
00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:50,440
sinner of sorts I might not understand

1510
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:52,509
this to the degree and kind of with the

1511
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,609
granularity that you do I would just say

1512
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,410
that this is really really important as

1513
00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:58,270
a foundation but I would say the

1514
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,399
following which is that if your goal is

1515
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:04,210
to make a secure system that's simply

1516
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,220
not possible so on this chart which I

1517
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,230
think I put up for leaders or policy

1518
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,970
makers of hey if you essentially are

1519
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,280
accountable for the operation of any

1520
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,319
particular sort whether that's broadly

1521
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,859
or just locally need to think about

1522
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,020
three things

1523
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:19,180
think about cyber in its real form which

1524
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,140
is its people process and technology if

1525
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,149
you're only defending one of those

1526
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,430
you're not defending any of those two

1527
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,839
here's this point I want to hammer down

1528
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,910
Security's not possible defense at net

1529
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,310
speed is the goal now I have three

1530
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,290
children I love them all equally one of

1531
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:35,770
them is a submarine officer I'm he flies

1532
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:38,020
really low and slow and it graduated

1533
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:40,390
graduated from the Naval Academy I still

1534
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,890
don't quite get all of that economically

1535
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,660
that was a really good

1536
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,129
thing and you know teaching the Naval

1537
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,420
Academy I like to say takes an air force

1538
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:50,260
officer to raise a naval officer it

1539
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,000
turns outs literally true but but I will

1540
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,700
say this about what he's taught me about

1541
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,440
this this theory so I asked him once I

1542
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,569
said so you know Paul um you know what's

1543
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,710
the submarine all about you know I need

1544
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,090
to get my head around that I'm your

1545
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,490
father and you know I'd like to think

1546
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,150
that I'm a kind of citizen of the world

1547
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,859
understand these things these

1548
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,940
complicated things he says only two

1549
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,320
things you need to know about the sub

1550
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,020
dead I'm one it's trying to kill the

1551
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,180
crew right 24 hours a day the subs job

1552
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,500
is first and foremost to kill the right

1553
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,970
because there's a nuclear reactor on

1554
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,500
board it's got a 40 year power supply

1555
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,839
and these submarines in the room it's

1556
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,660
got a nuclear reactor on board you know

1557
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,640
it's very I mean it's complicated it's

1558
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,109
dangerous if not properly managed you

1559
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,370
know knock on wood never had a real

1560
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,410
problem on board one of the submarines

1561
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:31,750
he says there are lots of kerb dark

1562
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,190
spaces whirring machines in there get

1563
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,480
below a hundred feet underwater I don't

1564
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,800
know how far they can really go but get

1565
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,480
below a hundred feet underwater pinhole

1566
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,530
leak take your arm off at five yards it

1567
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,970
is dangerous

1568
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,650
I said well I won't share that with your

1569
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,540
mother what's the second thing you guys

1570
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,220
the second thing is it's our home you

1571
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,600
say we strap this thing on it makes our

1572
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,270
air it makes our water it's got a

1573
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,400
forty-year power supply and we sally

1574
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,320
forth having strap this thing on and

1575
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,060
they go out for three four or five

1576
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,770
months at a time and we outwit

1577
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,480
outmaneuver more audacious and our

1578
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:00,640
adversary in that commonly dangerous

1579
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,770
space that's cyberspace in a nutshell

1580
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,970
right it is eternally deficient it will

1581
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,620
kill you if you're not paying attention

1582
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,970
to it all right if you kind of just

1583
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,470
store your stuff in the cloud and just

1584
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,419
leave it at that it's like it's a I have

1585
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,939
no idea where it is you know I'm a cyber

1586
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,620
idiot and you then kind of say but but

1587
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,970
it wasn't properly attended to by

1588
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,680
whoever actually sold you the cloud

1589
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,779
service not mentioning and anyone by

1590
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,520
name but but if it's not properly

1591
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,990
attended to because you didn't take the

1592
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,180
time and attention to understand it down

1593
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,379
to its deck plates and say understand

1594
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,779
what's deficiencies are but I'm gonna

1595
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,940
strap this thing on and I'm going to use

1596
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,460
it I'm gonna practice operational bility

1597
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,140
maneuverability possibly audacity I'm to

1598
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,910
outwit outmaneuver adversaries in this

1599
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,859
space even if those adversaries are my

1600
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,359
kind of employees who perhaps aren't

1601
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,070
practicing the right kind of cyber

1602
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,840
hygiene if you think about it that way

1603
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:46,360
which is never secure only defensible

1604
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,460
therefore I must defend it you're in the

1605
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,890
right place intellectually and you just

1606
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,270
will you will outwit your adversaries in

1607
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,740
that space and finally it's about

1608
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,300
operations more than technology

1609
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,930
it was affiliated with a company not

1610
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,390
long ago

1611
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:01,629
that actually had some issues attendant

1612
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:03,129
to the kind of wanna cry virus and when

1613
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,319
we looked at what happened it turns out

1614
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,940
a very small percentage of the servers

1615
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:08,558
have been affected by wanna cry right

1616
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,930
that was the North Korean kind of event

1617
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,059
in the spring of 2017 and when you

1618
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,220
looked at the literal the physical map

1619
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,960
of this this organization they were

1620
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,430
perfectly physically distributed you

1621
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,170
couldn't have done this more finely if

1622
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:22,180
you'd essentially asked Rand McNally to

1623
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,190
give you the map and so we said why

1624
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,868
these very few and why are they so

1625
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:27,069
perfectly distributed well because

1626
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,930
they're the hub controllers was the

1627
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:30,579
answer from the technologists why didn't

1628
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,379
you patch the hub controllers because

1629
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:34,059
the ops people said we can't patch the

1630
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,009
hub controllers until we're sure that

1631
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:37,450
the patch works on all the other kind of

1632
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:38,559
things why is that

1633
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,450
well the hub controller is the most

1634
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,220
important part of the system and to

1635
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,509
which I responded so you didn't send the

1636
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,009
hub controllers because they're the most

1637
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:46,329
important part of the system well it's

1638
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:48,759
not what we said no that's what you said

1639
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:51,130
I'm not sure that's what you meant right

1640
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:53,200
and why was that because the operator

1641
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:55,359
said kind of we're thinking about this

1642
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,890
as operations do not impact our

1643
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,049
operation with the patch that might not

1644
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,239
be well formed and therefore to the

1645
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:03,940
technologist said you have you need our

1646
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,559
permission to patch so now you don't fix

1647
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,509
that by beating the living daylights out

1648
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:08,710
of the IT Crowd the technologist because

1649
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:10,119
they're not the ones who took the risk

1650
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,099
they're the ones that are trying to

1651
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,140
discover the risk that their own friends

1652
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:15,519
are taking what you do to fix that is to

1653
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,828
say this is an operational issue

1654
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,149
patching is an operational issue we're

1655
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:20,799
gonna hold the operators accountable for

1656
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:23,200
patching from this day forward and

1657
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,759
therefore the operators if the have

1658
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,009
failed to patch and something untoward

1659
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:28,869
happens or the accountable party all of

1660
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:30,279
a sudden now at that particular company

1661
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,859
you need the permission of the operators

1662
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:34,329
to not patch and the IT Crowd the

1663
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:36,339
technologists are the operators best

1664
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:39,039
friends right first first meeting kind

1665
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:41,410
of Revere's was what is patching and why

1666
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,849
should I do that that then has a kind of

1667
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,499
salutary effect on roles

1668
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:46,630
responsibilities that's really important

1669
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:48,279
I'm gonna wrap up here with just a kind

1670
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,140
of a look into education and then I'll

1671
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:52,329
look over the shoulder at that original

1672
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,489
problem I showed you about what the

1673
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:56,710
Russians are up to education and career

1674
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:58,299
tracks of course they matter that's why

1675
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,950
we're in the room right there's largely

1676
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:01,779
an ability here to kind of exchange

1677
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:03,669
information to share best practices

1678
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:05,319
share insights conflict of ideas here

1679
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:07,390
it's going to make us all the smarter

1680
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:09,069
forward and so it's a marriage of what

1681
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,670
strategy and doctrine what's operational

1682
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:12,220
practice

1683
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,530
knowledge in education or in execution

1684
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:16,839
but this requires education to match now

1685
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:18,790
this is a particularly into how the u.s.

1686
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:20,529
Naval Academy thanks to spaff and a few

1687
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,630
others thinks about this we actually

1688
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:24,460
have a cyber program at the u.s. Naval

1689
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,380
Academy as I've indicated earlier it's

1690
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,119
about cyber operations not cyber

1691
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,250
operations but operation in a world

1692
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:31,690
dependent upon cyber and therefore we

1693
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,880
think that there are three levels of

1694
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,619
this we think that everybody no matter

1695
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,640
what you're gonna do in life who goes

1696
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:38,680
through the United States Naval Academy

1697
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,420
needs to know something more about cyber

1698
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,848
than they naturally do right because

1699
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,609
what we get at the age of 17 18 are not

1700
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:47,079
digital natives we get app natives right

1701
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:49,509
they can't really tell you where the

1702
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,190
cloud is they think it's a thing or a

1703
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,720
place but they really don't care about

1704
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,190
that I just want to know that this app

1705
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,990
gets me to the right place at the right

1706
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,790
time and therefore they think at the

1707
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:59,890
surface level about things that have a

1708
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,940
strategic consequence if you don't

1709
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,650
understand something about the

1710
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,450
underpinnings so everybody needs to get

1711
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,329
some basic familiarity with this maybe

1712
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:09,819
akin to a driver's education there are

1713
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:12,280
many kind of the Aspen Institute

1714
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:14,140
estimates that 71 million people within

1715
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,000
the United States in various professions

1716
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,040
that don't have cyber in their title

1717
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,900
need to know something more in order to

1718
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,308
be professionally adept at what they do

1719
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,380
lawyers need to know something about

1720
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:25,299
cyber law engineers needed us know

1721
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,309
something about creating resilient

1722
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:30,369
systems fault-tolerant systems which has

1723
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:31,720
a cyber underpinning scientists need to

1724
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:33,400
know something about you know their

1725
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,509
dependence on digital infrastructure

1726
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,640
such that they take reasonable

1727
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,530
precautions to ensure that they're

1728
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,629
resilient and robust against natural or

1729
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,190
perhaps predatory practices and then

1730
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,809
finally at the top of this pyramid there

1731
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,000
are a few who do have cyber in their

1732
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:48,280
name as most of you know we're still

1733
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,319
short in terms of the number of people

1734
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,930
who have that deep and sharp expertise I

1735
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,279
think by one estimate by the year 2020

1736
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,720
we'll be about 2 million short in the

1737
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,059
United States it's a great time to have

1738
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,740
cyber in your professional title but

1739
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:01,059
they are the tip of the iceberg the one

1740
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,609
that's most visible we need to worry

1741
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:05,230
about the bottom two layers as well at

1742
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:07,540
the u.s. Naval Academy then we think

1743
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,760
about that all many few right kind of

1744
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,790
prospect this way we kind of these

1745
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,990
circles we think that all of those

1746
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:17,109
contributions all of those disciplines

1747
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:19,629
need to be somehow allocated across the

1748
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:21,279
all many few right so some sense of

1749
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,850
operational theory at the Naval Academy

1750
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,040
we call that offense defense

1751
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:27,319
we're the military after all human

1752
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,610
factors policy law ethics there are

1753
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,140
certain means and methods that are

1754
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,910
appropriate certain means and methods

1755
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,950
that are not appropriate the defense of

1756
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,540
privacy is as important as the pursuit

1757
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,390
of security in American society

1758
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,160
like-minded nations security kind of

1759
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,200
basics of you know what it does it mean

1760
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,299
to be secure and increasingly that means

1761
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,100
to be defensible and then well defended

1762
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,980
we need to think about the implications

1763
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,360
of connectivity networking data

1764
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,190
structures computing programming

1765
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,270
physical systems all the basic blocking

1766
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,010
and tackling in terms of the

1767
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,660
underpinning technology if you have a

1768
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,310
program that's trying to serve the

1769
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,680
interest that kind of the disciplines

1770
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,870
that cut across right the all the many

1771
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,370
of the few that doesn't have one of

1772
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,109
these components it's probably

1773
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,880
short-sighted in terms of not then

1774
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,410
equipping everybody in the room who's

1775
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,940
going to participate ultimately in this

1776
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,920
defense let me wrap up

1777
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,690
remember this chart that I showed you

1778
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,640
earlier where I said the Russians came

1779
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,840
at us at three different levels let's

1780
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,980
see some of you taking pictures of the

1781
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,210
charts they're not that interesting but

1782
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,030
if you want to copy see me after and

1783
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:24,800
I'll just send you a soft copy of it I

1784
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:29,390
promise with with no Tagalongs right so

1785
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,800
I promise so the this three levels that

1786
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,270
I showed you earlier I talked about the

1787
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,010
foundational level what's the response

1788
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,259
to that just basic information assurance

1789
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:39,080
basic due diligence basic defense of

1790
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:41,180
network components which is technology

1791
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,770
people process the second level I said

1792
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,089
what's the response to that that's a

1793
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,800
collaborative endeavor between the

1794
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,290
various parties that participate in an

1795
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,970
election system or perhaps in the

1796
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,250
creation and defense of an electrical

1797
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:54,290
grid this third level that's a problem

1798
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,000
because what happens is do all the stuff

1799
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,800
that I've described or maybe may not

1800
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,090
have the right answer but if you do all

1801
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,440
the stuff that I described

1802
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,820
you're probably going to have some

1803
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,440
pretty significant impact on that

1804
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,060
foundational level the basic blocking

1805
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,950
and tackling level probably going to

1806
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,450
have a pretty healthy impact in terms of

1807
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:10,939
setting up the collaboration the due

1808
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:12,439
diligence right the kind of coherence

1809
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,450
across all of these instruments of power

1810
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,770
at that second level but this third

1811
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,720
level if somebody's going to try to

1812
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,950
subvert you using this digital

1813
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,779
infrastructure right it actually

1814
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,730
actually some pernicious effects

1815
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,440
pernicious abilities they're going to

1816
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,790
come at you in the third level then the

1817
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,830
things we've been talking about for the

1818
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,509
last 10 15 years and frankly there's not

1819
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:31,069
much new in this presentation in that

1820
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,230
regard things we've been talking about

1821
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,730
will wind up falling short because if

1822
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,110
you were to defend your confidence

1823
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,240
you're going to defend your

1824
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,550
ecology here to defend your kind of

1825
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,859
sense that ham and I've got forward

1826
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,390
motion you need to have strategy that

1827
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,370
essentially is something that the

1828
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,710
adversary needs to catch up to and chase

1829
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,540
need to have critical thinking such that

1830
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,630
you can properly diagnose what's being

1831
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,920
done to you that you're not kind of

1832
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,870
incredulous up and you need to have

1833
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,580
national will and execution and if I

1834
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,470
worry about anything in cyberspace I

1835
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,180
worry most about that that we're not

1836
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:04,100
joined up in that regard we don't have a

1837
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,410
national strategy we don't have forward

1838
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,980
momentum kind of if the Russians were to

1839
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:11,540
come again at us in 2016 they would say

1840
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,220
the fault isn't in the Stars it was in

1841
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,170
you right we took advantage of your

1842
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,939
internal divisions we took advantage of

1843
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,350
your not being joined up we took

1844
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,600
advantage of you not perhaps

1845
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:23,420
collaborating across these stovepipes

1846
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,880
you were easy prey it's a great article

1847
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,260
written in political calm it's about two

1848
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,540
years old now by a guy named Reed

1849
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,580
Standish and what he says in the article

1850
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,710
was he asked a question he says why are

1851
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,180
the Finns the nation of Finland why are

1852
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,890
they not worried about the Russians

1853
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,589
careening into their election and the

1854
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,879
way they did into ours right and and the

1855
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,320
answer isn't because the Russians aren't

1856
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,570
trying right they're actually kind of

1857
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,220
equal service in this regard they said

1858
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:48,770
the answer is attributable to three

1859
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,750
things one the Finnish government places

1860
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,580
a premium on critical thinking right so

1861
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,230
in the education system when they're

1862
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,390
raising their children you can't just

1863
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,350
kind of memorize and recite back write

1864
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,540
the Gettysburg Address

1865
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,670
you can't just memorize and recite back

1866
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,900
some kind of mathematical principle so

1867
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:04,550
now you actually need to internalize

1868
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,080
they figure out what it means kind of

1869
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:08,060
look at the convenient inconvenient

1870
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,009
facts and give me a recitation as to how

1871
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,630
you synthesize and essentially make

1872
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,790
sense of those facts critical thinking

1873
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:16,310
is given a premium to the government

1874
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:17,570
itself which is only astride 5.6 million

1875
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,980
people you could get them all here on

1876
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,320
the Purdue campus and tell them what to

1877
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,910
do and then dispense disperse them but

1878
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,860
to the the finished government goes to

1879
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:27,049
great lengths to have a forward-looking

1880
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,730
strategy and then to communicate that to

1881
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,680
all the stakeholders and to essentially

1882
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,330
create this forward momentum and three

1883
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,190
they have material experience with

1884
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:35,750
Russians living cheek by jowl with them

1885
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,090
so if you're Russian you need to do

1886
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,200
three things first you need to catch up

1887
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,970
to the Finns they're not waiting to be

1888
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,160
picked apart to need to get past the

1889
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:44,629
critical thinkers and three you need to

1890
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,549
look like something other than Russian

1891
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,470
right we need to put those advantages on

1892
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:49,880
our side we need to essentially be more

1893
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,649
cognizant more aware

1894
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,150
what's happening in the space we need to

1895
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:55,250
actually go back to having a premium

1896
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,810
placed on critical thinking in three we

1897
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,160
need forward momentum otherwise we're

1898
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:01,430
just standing still ready to be picked

1899
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,290
apart and the kind of the approximation

1900
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,120
of collaboration as division of effort

1901
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:06,650
where you defend a I'll defend being

1902
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,440
there the twain shall meet will kill us

1903
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,640
it'll be a disaster I've left all of six

1904
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,110
minutes for any questions you might ask

1905
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,819
and I'd be happy to take any of the

1906
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:16,210
questions that you have so who's got one

1907
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,210
yes sir

1908
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,540
yeah that's a fair question

1909
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:32,510
I didn't mean for this chart to be

1910
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:34,700
interpreted as a cyber chart it is I

1911
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:36,559
apply it to the cyber world but it

1912
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,359
didn't mean for the kind of tools that

1913
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,970
we'd use at any level to be restricted

1914
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:42,319
to cyber so let's say that somebody does

1915
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,520
just what you've said which is hey

1916
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,920
they're going to attack Wall Street

1917
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,119
using some zero day vulnerability that

1918
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,210
they've inserted in the supply chain

1919
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,349
leave the mechanism aside and we kind of

1920
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,910
get to the place where we say hey look

1921
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,930
all of these green things they didn't

1922
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,578
save us right

1923
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,290
we're therefore having to kind of defend

1924
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:59,240
ourselves close in and perhaps impose

1925
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:01,490
some consequence on them we need to use

1926
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,979
all instruments of power at our disposal

1927
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:05,808
to do this right now I kind of went

1928
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:09,140
through I'm kind of an alliteration in a

1929
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:11,059
financial sanctions kind of public

1930
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,990
shaming all that stuff the kinetic power

1931
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,599
that we can bring to bear of the

1932
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:17,359
military is included in that but but in

1933
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:20,150
our society many societies there's this

1934
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,589
idea of necessity and proportionality so

1935
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,790
therefore we need to make sure that the

1936
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:24,799
punishment fits the crime

1937
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:26,390
right that we've actually got a long

1938
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:28,910
view on this and we're not simply

1939
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:30,618
reacting with a nuclear weapon right to

1940
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,450
something that is a kind of a cyber

1941
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:33,710
event there probably are situations

1942
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,598
where nuclear weapon might be the right

1943
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:37,730
choice god forbid that we lived through

1944
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,619
that day right so but but I'm with you

1945
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:41,780
on that I would say that I thought the

1946
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:44,630
question you were gonna ask is you know

1947
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,670
why why when we have those very clean

1948
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,450
lines those tripwires established in the

1949
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,890
physical space

1950
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,328
why aren't they that clean and why isn't

1951
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,308
the government coming in to help right

1952
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:54,890
in cyberspace government's been through

1953
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:57,349
a maturing process from 2012 to present

1954
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:59,240
remember when the Iranians did what they

1955
01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:01,369
did in 2012 the government did not stand

1956
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,779
in it was out of respect for the

1957
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:05,240
sovereignty of the private sector turns

1958
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,799
out in hindsight not not too smart when

1959
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,990
the North Koreans attacked Sony Pictures

1960
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,609
the government said I will defend the

1961
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:12,740
private sector against nation-state

1962
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:14,598
adversaries but I don't know how right

1963
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,629
so at a time in place of my choosing was

1964
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,130
the language in 2016 the government was

1965
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:21,049
not aware of what was happening at the

1966
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:22,970
second and especially the third level

1967
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:24,890
therefore it didn't have the cognizance

1968
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:27,410
to stand in so 2018 the government did

1969
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,000
two things not not as the only player in

1970
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:30,230
this space and not even as the primary

1971
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,920
player in this space but you've asked

1972
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,240
the question

1973
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,980
government first said I have to be

1974
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,808
cognizant I have to actually go forward

1975
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,950
and if they are likely adversaries I

1976
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:39,019
have to understand what the devil are up

1977
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:42,019
to right I can't just stand back and

1978
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:43,700
wait to right to react well and to when

1979
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:45,828
it's all things that were kind of on the

1980
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,839
rise essentially holding our election at

1981
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:49,190
risk kicked out the legs from underneath

1982
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:51,950
that now most of that I'm sure is

1983
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:53,839
classified and so I won't describe it

1984
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:56,029
further but I think the remarkable thing

1985
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:57,680
about the day after the 2018 elections

1986
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:58,400
when the losers got up they said we lost

1987
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,960
fair and square

1988
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,819
unless of course you were in Georgia but

1989
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:08,299
that's a local issue yes sir

1990
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:10,940
wonderful presentation I'll turn the

1991
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:12,890
question a lot of vision a lot of

1992
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:15,260
wonderful goals there's a huge gap

1993
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:18,170
between reality now and much of what you

1994
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:20,119
have in the presentation so what is the

1995
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,740
next step so the government spending

1996
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:24,829
while they are talking about on

1997
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:27,649
improving funding a lot of that money

1998
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:29,390
hasn't shown up yet we know that a lot

1999
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,430
of times you people don't go to action

2000
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:33,650
until after the fact and we're looking

2001
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:37,788
for a global meltdown before we see a

2002
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:39,230
significant active action so so what

2003
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:41,900
what do you think is the most logical

2004
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:44,509
next step to expect for 2020 saying

2005
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,519
federal funding private or funding so

2006
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:48,529
and that's between it's a great question

2007
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:50,089
and if we had eight hours I'd give you a

2008
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:52,579
lot more detail but you'd be bored to

2009
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,990
tears but but that's why the title of my

2010
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:55,670
slide is this time to get on with it

2011
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:57,859
everything that I suggest in here is

2012
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:00,349
doable actionable all right I tried to

2013
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:02,058
put that out in a coherent way so so let

2014
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,549
me just take the last example kind of

2015
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:07,720
you know in hand the United States

2016
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:10,940
government in 2012 just stood off right

2017
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,669
2018 it stood in and I think too good

2018
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:15,710
and material effect that's one small but

2019
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:18,049
important contribution right the private

2020
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:19,549
sector increasingly says I get it I'm a

2021
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:21,440
part of this I can't just wait for

2022
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:23,420
somebody to save my networks or defend

2023
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,250
my networks if I'm not doing basic

2024
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,950
resilience then I'm gonna be held

2025
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,960
accountable by the SEC if I'm a public

2026
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,910
corporation my shareholders even if I'm

2027
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,009
you know not the private shareholders if

2028
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:35,480
I'm not and by adversaries you're just

2029
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:37,369
gonna kind of have their way with me so

2030
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,019
all of these pieces are beginning to

2031
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:41,660
come into play and I think the thing

2032
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:42,459
that's missing is the kind of inherent

2033
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,500
cohesion

2034
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,510
the coherence of them so that everybody

2035
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,250
can say I got it if I place myself at

2036
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:49,869
this part of the line I have confidence

2037
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,089
to the right of me to the left of me the

2038
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:54,040
other parts are also being applied and I

2039
01:07:52,089 --> 01:07:55,839
frankly think well this is a bit of a

2040
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,460
big hand over a little map it's a

2041
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:59,619
question of just do it right we don't

2042
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:02,290
lack the technology that we can kind of

2043
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:04,150
deploy to kind of defend ourselves we

2044
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:06,250
don't lack the authorities to defend

2045
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:07,900
ourselves what we lack is the strategy

2046
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:10,210
and the coherence of all those pieces

2047
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,040
and if we did that we find that life is

2048
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:14,560
as noisy and much of a royal as it is a

2049
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,870
walk across say Eastern New York City

2050
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,460
but manageable defensible right you can

2051
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:21,189
essentially caution you can take your

2052
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:25,299
risk appropriately and you can just like

2053
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:27,009
my son submarine sally forth yes sir hi

2054
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:28,960
great presentation and you talked about

2055
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:31,630
the importance of strategy and

2056
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,540
priorities with respect to cyber defense

2057
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:36,700
so the in this the introduction of

2058
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,390
interred in Internet of Things the IOT

2059
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,639
oh yes

2060
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:41,589
has increased the attack surface by

2061
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,600
introducing more vulnerable devices

2062
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:45,430
starting from critical infrastructure to

2063
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,410
supply chain to everything right can you

2064
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:51,460
share your thoughts on what the strategy

2065
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:53,559
in priorities yeah I think three things

2066
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:56,799
about the Internet of Things and one of

2067
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,839
them isn't just say no so they're here

2068
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,269
they're coming on right there I'm kind

2069
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:03,009
of overwhelming us the first is is that

2070
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,500
we need to understand what they are and

2071
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:07,420
what they're not right so so they are

2072
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,299
attack surfaces but but they're kind of

2073
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:11,980
limited feature attack surfaces right

2074
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:13,750
it's much easier to determine an anomaly

2075
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,939
right in an Internet of Things thing

2076
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,738
than it is in a general-purpose computer

2077
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:18,879
that accepts any piece of code as

2078
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:21,218
perhaps the next thing that it's

2079
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,660
supposed to do and so therefore if we

2080
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:25,359
understand that these things are not

2081
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,950
themselves inherently trustworthy but

2082
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,480
they do have some perhaps smaller

2083
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:29,799
envelope around which you can define

2084
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,718
anomalies we need to make sure that we

2085
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:33,700
take pains to do that and build networks

2086
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:35,350
that we say are inherently composed of

2087
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,488
you know untrustworthy things but I

2088
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,810
actually have an overlay that says I

2089
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:39,968
understand what their state of play is

2090
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:42,150
at a moment in time and third I think

2091
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:44,589
that we do need to enforce a regime

2092
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:46,238
where we try to figure out you know at

2093
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:48,160
what point they constitute too great a

2094
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,169
risk to us so there's no patch Tuesday

2095
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,880
for the Internet of Things but there

2096
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:53,710
just might be some kind of you know

2097
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,000
limit beyond which we say hey these

2098
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:57,010
things if they're in your network

2099
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,260
I'm no longer going to insure you I'm no

2100
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,390
longer going to perhaps kind of hold you

2101
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,250
kind of innocent if something bad

2102
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,870
happens to you we need to impose some

2103
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,210
consequence for how you use these things

2104
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:08,980
the federal government is beginning down

2105
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:11,380
this road we'll heard congressman will

2106
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,610
Hurd has introduced legislation where he

2107
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,080
has said that the government will

2108
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,910
essentially practice those three things

2109
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,170
itself and then have an expectation that

2110
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,880
vendors that deal with the government

2111
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:21,280
will similarly do those three things I

2112
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,050
do think that it's possibly too little

2113
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,889
too late but at least it's a drop in the

2114
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,300
bucket heading in the right direction

2115
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,440
yes sir

2116
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,570
in regards to the private sector

2117
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:31,870
security going busca you're green to red

2118
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:34,000
chart the when you get to the the top

2119
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:37,480
level where you're you'd beat the access

2120
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,660
they're in there's you know intruders

2121
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:43,030
doing material harm to your network and

2122
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,620
on the physical side of security there

2123
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,450
are armed guards and buildings they're

2124
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,670
you know someone's robbing a bank the

2125
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:50,260
guard can shoot them drop in bed not

2126
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:53,260
something so serious in the cyber world

2127
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:56,680
but is there a point in time where the

2128
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:59,050
legalities of a private sector defend

2129
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,390
forward policy going back to check back

2130
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:03,460
pardon heck back yes a hack back

2131
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:06,160
excellent you stopped them from damaging

2132
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:08,260
your system you know that IT security

2133
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,970
gets on it goes in there and you know

2134
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,590
wrecks their ability to do damage to

2135
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:13,540
yours at further damage your system yeah

2136
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:16,690
so right now the law is relatively clear

2137
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:18,220
and and therefore unhelpful so the law

2138
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,019
would say that if somebody's actually

2139
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,640
beating you at your perimeter or just

2140
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:22,930
inside maybe just outside they've just

2141
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,590
stolen your stuff there it is you can

2142
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,900
see it right there

2143
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:27,700
right outside your system it is illegal

2144
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,950
for you to operate outside your system

2145
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,540
you don't have the authority to stand on

2146
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,019
somebody else's territory without their

2147
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,360
permission

2148
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:36,310
therefore you can't only not hack back

2149
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,610
but you can't actually do what might be

2150
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:41,680
called hot pursuit my sense is is that

2151
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:44,019
we need to give companies and ability to

2152
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,760
do reasonable things with the analog

2153
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:48,310
being the physical world right to

2154
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,990
essentially engage an adversary in hot

2155
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:51,940
pursuit but we need to have strict

2156
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:53,980
limitations and accountability imposed

2157
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,540
upon them about how far they go you can

2158
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,849
see your stuff right there right you

2159
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,890
know and you can actually lean in and

2160
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:01,660
essentially encrypt it or recover it

2161
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,740
with no damage no collateral effects to

2162
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:06,340
something else I think that's reasonable

2163
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,250
it's not now the law I think the idea of

2164
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,200
heck back

2165
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:11,330
is very dangerous I remember that

2166
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,440
example I gave about the Iranians doing

2167
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,059
something in financial infrastructure

2168
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,740
the US government thinking it was

2169
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:17,900
thoughtful but in fact it was spec list

2170
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,880
didn't do a darn thing some companies

2171
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,740
who were just taking this beating day

2172
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,540
after day actually read this thing

2173
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:25,639
called sarbanes-oxley where the CEO

2174
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:27,320
signs to say I am accountable for the

2175
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:29,240
fiduciary integrity of this organization

2176
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,799
and if I'm getting beat to death in

2177
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,059
cyberspace I just can't stand here and

2178
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,620
take it and the government's told me

2179
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:36,560
that I can do anything so they in some

2180
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:38,450
cases hacked back I'm not of the opinion

2181
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,760
that I know who that was but I know that

2182
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,809
in one case when they did it they went

2183
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,640
to the wrong place because they

2184
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,140
literally looked at a map like that and

2185
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,270
this it's Germany Germany is doing this

2186
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:49,880
to us and what they did was to engage

2187
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:51,560
the innocence right who already had been

2188
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,260
victimized and one of those red spaces

2189
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,420
and caused a further conflagration with

2190
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:58,340
respect to two nation-states and the one

2191
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,810
that got all the way back to Tehran they

2192
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,790
realized they got into the middle of a

2193
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:03,800
firefight that the Iranians didn't start

2194
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:05,330
the Iranians were actually responding to

2195
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,160
what they thought was a provocation and

2196
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:08,870
so when they got back to Tehran Iran

2197
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,210
says got it finally a worthy adversary

2198
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:12,680
and started to bring their full might to

2199
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,940
bear on this organization and that

2200
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,210
organization of private-sector

2201
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:18,379
organization did not have the ability to

2202
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:20,030
arrest an extra die did not have the

2203
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,590
ability to financially sanction did not

2204
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:23,389
have the ability to call a UN general

2205
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:25,370
session they were essentially witless

2206
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:26,870
alone and afraid very much afraid in

2207
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,190
that space that's an inherently

2208
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:30,110
governmental proposition and we don't

2209
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:31,790
want to actually have the private sector

2210
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:33,049
stand in on that so I think there's

2211
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,430
something in between where we are and

2212
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,870
where we're gonna go I know I've gone

2213
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:37,940
about seven minutes into your break I

2214
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:40,190
apologize for that I kind of thank you

2215
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:41,629
for your hospitality I see that one of

2216
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:43,370
us didn't get the word on the dress code

2217
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:45,310
I will do that appropriately as I leave

2218
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:48,439
but all the best for great conference

2219
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,439
[Music]

2220
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,978
very much

2221
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:53,979
[Applause]

2222
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,280
you
