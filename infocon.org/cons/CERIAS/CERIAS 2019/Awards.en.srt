1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:06,000
so this is day two of the serious

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,340
symposium but Court sort of well

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,559
internally we referred to as serious

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
hell week started on Friday of this last

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,579
week Sandia National Labs sent a bunch

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,060
of their their practitioners their

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,670
researchers - to campus we had a social

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,970
on Friday night and then on Saturday

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,349
there was a workshop where sandy and

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,609
professionals did training with all the

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,040
students that were there taught them

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,140
hands-on techniques for cyber forensics

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,540
and then on Sunday hosted an actual

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,579
competition and I was blown about a

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,010
blown away by it was very very cool a

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,930
lot of work obviously went into it the

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,519
students everyone on the student team

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,019
said this is the the best competition

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,219
they'd ever the most enjoyable

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,800
competition they'd ever been in and as

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,660
personally it was pretty proud when we

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,209
did the debrief that pretty was able to

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,440
sit in on the on the debrief and they

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,390
had reported that they've done this at

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,539
three other universities won't mention

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,580
those names but that our students had

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,350
had performed at a level higher than any

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,630
of the other universities that have yet

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,039
had this competition there so not that

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,560
that the other universe other

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,330
universities had done poorly but Purdue

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,750
students just it's exceptionally well so

33
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,619
it was great to have them there but we

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,720
thought this would be a great

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,670
opportunity to recognize the students

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,289
not just in the room with the rest of

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,000
the competitors and the sandy ins but in

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,549
front of all of the audience here at at

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,799
serious symposium as well as give some

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,840
recognition to Sandia for for bringing

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,700
this competition and sending so many of

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,590
their employees here to to run it so

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,040
with that I'm gonna hand the mic over to

44
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,320
Ken Patel who is Sandy's liaison that is

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,950
embedded here at Purdue to announce our

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,250
winners okay so with the winning team

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,250
come up

48
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:02,520

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,820
competition without leave over 3,000

50

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,199
and it's a series of competitions to to

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,390
make things happen

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,490
in terms of the they do different

54
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:17,579
challenges and they all compete to solve

55
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:21,080

93
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,740
posters was fantastic last night okay

94
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,820
then annually we have two awards that we

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,980
give away and one the first one which I

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,590
have the opportunity to to talk about is

97
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,050
the serious pillar award and the idea of

98
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,979
the pillar props you up so we identify

99
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,980
somebody who has gone out of the norm to

100
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,440
prop up to support the mission of

101
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,660
serious and every year we have a number

102
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,540
of quality candidates that consider

103
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,820
because we have such great support from

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,640
faculty staff students people from

105
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,890
industry that that work with us but this

106
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,140
year we had unbelievable candidate that

107
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,120
was almost a clear clear-cut it was

108
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,580
Universal when we met to decide who was

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,050
going to be the serious pillar this year

110
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:24,270
so this person has been quite active

111
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,400
with us they've actually is a person

112
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,219
from industry who has been embedded here

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,580
at the University and so can I have Kent

114
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,669
Patel please come back forward so can

115
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,770
less you can Patel has been working with

116
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,260
this this last year so I want to

117
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,130
highlight just a few of the the

118
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,440
accomplishments that Ken has brought to

119
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,940
two serious so when he showed up on

120
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,540
campus he said he'd been working with

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,880
the Intel interns the into the interns

122
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,580
at Sandia but he had an idea of

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,159
extending their internship to campus so

124
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,140
he established the Sandia externship

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,180
program and came to me and said what

126
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,039
what can Sirius do to help on this and

127
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,370
we decided that we actually had a lab

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,919
right in the headquarters of Sirius so

129
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,900
we refitted that lab and now Sandia is

130
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,299
running their externship program out of

131
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,859
the serious offices so in addition to

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,050
the lab workspace they're able to use

133
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,430
our common area they can get their

134
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,979
coffee they can hang out they've got

135
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,419
individual lockers so not only gives

136
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,070
them an opportunity to continue to work

137
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,630
for Sandia but it gives them an

138
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,150
opportunity to network with other

139
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,800
students with serious staff and hang out

140
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,830
together

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,169
Sirius is have had a long collaborative

142
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,960
relationship with Sandia but under Ken

143
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,270
here on campus has been able to foster

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,859
growing relationships between existing

145
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,340
researchers but has also had the

146
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,330
opportunity to learn about research that

147
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,400
Sandia may not have learned about before

148
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,080
and said hold on I think this needs to

149
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,969
be known back in such-and-such group in

150
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,560
Sandia and so has worked very hard to

151
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,350
connect what we're doing here on campus

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,300
that that Sandia can leverage the

153
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,219
existing research here but it has also

154
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,789
led to collaborative research that in

155
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:04,200
funding from Sandia has increased so

156
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,210
internally they have a funding

157
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,919
competition for start-up project

158
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,219
and serious is a number of those

159
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,870
internal projects at Sandia right now so

160
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,080
getting students involved hiring

161
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,030
students is very important to Sandia so

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,590
the we talked about ways to do that is

163
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,210
yes you can come to recruit and yes you

164
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,770
can hire students but the more

165
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,870
interaction that you have with students

166
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,530
the better off you will be so in the

167
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:32,220
fall Ken brought the space blimp coding

168
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,900
challenge now I'm not sure what blimps

169
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,789
are in space but I can think of other

170
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,650
things that are in space that do need

171
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,599
guidance systems that Sandia may be

172
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,758
interested in so we held a competition

173
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,940
here on and we packed an entire room

174
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,009
there were 60 competitors that came in

175
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,270
and all worked on cut this coding

176
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,180
challenge and had some unbelievable

177
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,508
ideas we recognize that winning team

178
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,280
back in the fall but the sandy ins who

179
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,729
came here were pretty amazed at some of

180
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,198
the work that the the students had done

181
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,909
we just talked about the tracer fire

182
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,500
cyber forensics competition that was a

183
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,020
two and a half day event this last

184
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:11,550
weekend that they sent their people here

185
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,830
and managed that ken has worked very

186
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,370
hard to host a number of faculty visits

187
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,580
to Sandia over this last year David

188
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,659
Ebert and I have where the beneficiaries

189
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,190
beneficiaries of one of those visits

190
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:26,370
just two weeks ago

191
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,830
but part of that coordination was also

192
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,419
working to get spaff in vetted for his

193
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,728
sabbatical at Sandia National Labs

194
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,559
entire last year so if that wasn't

195
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,630
enough to say that he has done an awful

196
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,088
lot to prop up and be a pillar of Sirius

197
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,349
this is the biggest news of all of it

198
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,789
and this is the first time we're talking

199
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,959
about it a press release will be coming

200
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,850
out in the next couple of weeks that

201
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,680
there is a brand new laboratory that

202
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,970
will be going in that is a we got to

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,870
think of a better name still but it is a

204
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,089
simulation model a mod sim lab that does

205
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,740
MU Latics that is very important sort of

206
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,779
digital twinning so in a ballista do

207
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,900
some additional cyber and cyber physical

208
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,270
systems modeling and experiments here it

209
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,579
is a ten million dollar lab development

210
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,319
from Sandia that will be installed here

211
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,250
over the summer it will be up and

212
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,980
running this fall

213
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,079
an unbelievable asset to our faculty and

214
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,690
our students it'll enable us to do an

215
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,160
additional collaboration with Sandia but

216
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,140
it'll be open for our students and

217
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,709
faculty to work on for any mu Latics

218
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,600
type

219
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,370

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,290

232
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,240

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:39,420
by Professor Bharat bhargava Dennis has

done amazing job with as research his

241
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,860
work with Northrop Grumman and the wax

242
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,400
croon project work in Ladak latent

243
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,130
semantic indexing and his work that you

244
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:57,480
saw winning the poster last night with

245
00:10:50,130 --> 00:11:00,210
data leakage work that he's done one of

246
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,100
the word winners right and so that's

247

he also has had 12 peer-reviewed

249
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,720
publications for his research attesting

250
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,459
to the fact that we don't just people

251
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,860
here at Purdue don't think his work as

252
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,650
outstanding but he's has an

253
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,710
international reputation even before he

254
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,720
graduates in May so please join me in

255
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:31,299
