1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
so this panel discussion is covering the

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,849
theme of sustainable planet and economy

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,380
and some of the fun and challenges that

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,730
we have in trying to organize events

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,650
like this or figure out who are the

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,750
right people to put on the panel and I

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,460
think we haven't have a fantastic panel

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,750
all that our moderator do the

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,960
introductions but I get the opportunity

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,300
to introduce our moderator so Rosalie

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,340
Clawson is a political science professor

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,199
she served as the department head for

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,939
six years of the political science

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,279
department here until she was asked by

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,200
the university to assume the role of the

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,770
interim director of Purdue's policy and

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,440
research institute PPR I so serious and

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,440
PPR I have had a relationship for a

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,680
number of years but since rosie has

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,780
taken over as its interim director our

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,539
relationships have strengthened and

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,160
growth growing a lot closer so I could

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,379
present this as an opportunity as one

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,898
more step in trying to draw our two

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,608
organizations closer or I could say this

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,739
is payback for Rosie asking me to

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,379
moderate a panel a few weeks ago at her

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,970
event so with that Rosie thank you very

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,540
much and I look forward to the

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,539
conversation

31
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,470
yeah better thank you all right let me

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,479
start all over

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,580
good afternoon welcome to the panel on

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,549
securing giant leaps toward a

35
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,770
sustainable economy and planet as many

36
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,740
of you know sustainability is one of the

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,590
major themes of Purdue's celebration of

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,449
our hundred and fiftieth anniversary as

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,170
a political scientist who studies

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:59,390
American politics we certainly know that

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,330
our policymakers are sometimes vexed by

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:05,039
problems and issues like sustainability

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,800
and if you pay attention to

44
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,170
congressional hearings and presidential

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,410
tweets you might also think that our

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,319
policymakers are vexed when it comes to

47
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,190
issues of technology in general and

48
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,958
cyber security in particular so it's a

49
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,569
pleasure to be here today with these

50
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,950
four experts who can actually shed light

51
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:32,700
on sustainability and cyber security and

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,510
I'm happy to introduce them today first

calibration we are pleased to have these

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,320
four speakers with us today we are going

103
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,919
to start with John and then move across

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,960
the panel I've asked them to speech to

105
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,150
speak for a few minutes but also to

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,159
leave time for questions from the

107
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,840
audience so thank you panelists all

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,500
right thank you can everyone hear me

109
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,380
okay all right so again I'm John

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,020
Sutherland I know a couple things I know

111
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,969
I'm a manufacturing person because

112
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,889
that's what I was trained in and over

113
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,720
the last almost 30 years I've for better

114
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,690
for worse I've become a leader in the

115
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,090
area of green manufacturing or as we say

116
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,560
sometimes sustainable manufacturing I

117
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,530
know very little about cybersecurity but

118
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,979
I've been talking to David quite a bit

119
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,559
and and so we now recognize that and

120
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,719
I've known this for a while that

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,310
cybersecurity as it relates to

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,060
manufacturing is an incredibly critical

123
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,639
area I thought it was appropriate for me

124
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,009
to kind of

125
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,840
kick things off to make sure that we're

126
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,650
all on the same page with regard to

127
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,460
sustainability because like I know very

128
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,888
little about cybersecurity perhaps some

129
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,310
of you may may not be very familiar with

130
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,740
the idea of sustainability so

131
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,520
sustainability essentially says that we

132
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,379
should be operating in a way today and

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,139
into the future so that future

134
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:18,979
generations have the same opportunities

135
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,139
that we enjoy today so that means we

136
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,870
need to use resources in a certain way

137
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,689
today so that future generations have

138
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,870
access to resources we don't want to

139
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:33,349
drown ourselves in waste today and thus

140
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,900
her future generations so all this has

141
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,990
implications and how we design products

142
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:43,340
how we design manufacturing processes

143
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:46,520
and other systems how we operate them

144
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,310
and how we behave as we move into the

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,650
future oftentimes we say that

146
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,240
sustainability sometimes people think it

147
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:57,710
only means the environment but in fact

148
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,779
sustainability implies much more than

149
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:05,120
that it means that we need to be

150
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:07,819
thinking long term about our our world

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,819
around us so in fact the environment but

152
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:12,770
we also have to think about society and

153
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,319
the social systems that make up our

154
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,830
lives of which one of them is the

155
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,409
economy and that's why we have this

156
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:26,599
sustainable economy and planet theme for

157
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:28,759
the Purdue's 150th anniversary so I in

158
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,610
particular do research and teach in the

159
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,979
area of sustainability as it relates to

160
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,949
manufacturing and there the idea is all

161
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,529
about anticipating some of these

162
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,159
challenges with regard to manufacturing

163
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,360
and then trying to avoid creating

164
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:46,730
problems that we have to clean up in the

165
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,910
future Simon

166
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:53,860
so yes so I have two roles in MasterCard

167
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,270
the first is to bring or to support the

168
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,250
cybersecurity solutions that are banks

169
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,130
and our merchants globally support and

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,810
last cut is about fifty two million

171
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,780
merchants twenty-five thousand banks

172
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,690
nearly three billion card holders today

173
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,809
were in this room not have a MasterCard

174
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,060
you have one that's all the matters more

175
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,210
than one so yes so the whole ecosystem

176
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,930
now MasterCard would say this is

177
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,310
important because cash sucks yeah if you

178
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,870
get robbed and you lose your cash it's

179
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,230
gone yeah if you give cash the wrong

180
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,850
person it's gone it takes a lot of water

181
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,460
and chemicals to make cash you've got to

182
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:34,669
ship it around it generally is hideously

183
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,840
archaic an electronic transaction solver

184
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,189
they did a lot of these problems you

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,720
have fused pairs give it to the wrong

186
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,700
person you can get it back if somebody

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,590
steals your card it doesn't matter there

188
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,610
are so many tangible benefits which is

189
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,830
why we give refugees prepaid cards why

190
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,710
if you're if you're on benefits in the

191
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,320
u.s. you get a prepaid credit card there

192
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,210
are so many solutions that work for poor

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,600
that digitally disenfranchised the un--

194
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,550
banks that are better without cash so

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,070
MasterCard is is all big in that world

196
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,290
and my world is making sure that when

197
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,660
you use your card online that you get

198
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,099
your stuff you know that the money

199
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,689
doesn't go to the wrong place that if

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,480
you're scammed you get your money back

201
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,550
and most of the work my teams do are

202
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,070
about blocking the ability for cyber

203
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,199
criminals to generate revenue we still

204
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,200
shift from hackers we destroy their

205
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,230
reputations we are angry pursuers of

206
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,850
cyber criminals within the law but then

207
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,180
we work with law enforcement to go that

208
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,340
extra step and get them tased

209
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,819
we are we really take that I mean my

210
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,560
team take is very passionate about any

211
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,290
leakage of money to cyber criminals

212
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,359
because these are not teenagers buying

213
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,209
games these are Russian grant gangs

214
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,490
Ukrainian criminal gangs there's so much

215
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,920
social evil the the money stole from

216
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,780
stole through cyber crime pays for drug

217
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,560
manufacturing guns prostitution human

218
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,000
trafficking so part of my job is looking

219
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,439
at all the possible ways people can

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,560
monetize electronic trends

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,580
actions to illegally and how do we stop

222
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,650
it

223
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,330
the second part of my job is interesting

224
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,250
in the in it's the first time in 30

225
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,270
years I can actually claim my degree is

226
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,760
useful we are I am responsible for how

227
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,250
the cards are made so the plastic your

228
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,120
card is made of the chip the hologram on

229
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,830
it the mag stripe all that standards and

230
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,670
physical requirements of a credit card

231
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,330
that you have in your pocket a

232
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,640
MasterCard

233
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,310
come through my group and that's

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,740
important because there's any one broken

235
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,709
a card recently has anyone had a card

236
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,630
break before it was renewed that's

237
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,770
because of the way we make the cards we

238
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,840
have to make this card it's not

239
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,660
single-use plastic it's passed the last

240
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,730
three years has to never snap work every

241
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,339
time he has to go through a cash machine

242
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,350
or a fuel pump and come back out again

243
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,140
it can't fail because if the card breaks

244
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,300
it destroys your opinion of that Bank

245
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,660
perhaps of electronic transactions if

246
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,900
the card lets you down that's a big deal

247
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,790
and part of my world is how do I make

248
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,949
those cards which are about one

249
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,030
thousandth of 1% of the plastic

250
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,060
production in the world's our three

251
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,250
billion cards a year had away what do I

252
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,390
do with them when when three years is up

253
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:19,100
how do I recycle them it's they're made

254
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,110
of very very many different plastics

255
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,880
they're not made very sustainably

256
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,220
typically because they have to have such

257
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,900
a long life I have a machine that twists

258
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,150
them to check when they bend and things

259
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,040
but how do we turn that into a into a

260
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,890
model where we can use sustainable bio

261
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,750
plastics ocean source plastics and still

262
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,890
give you the confidence that when you

263
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,210
put in the cash machine that it will

264
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,280
come back out again

265
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,170
so that's the second part of my job

266
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,780
first part is is the cyber world the

267
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,260
second is the physical the cryptography

268
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,579
of the chip stopping people stealing it

269
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,100
did anyone notice we got rid of

270
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,510
signatures earlier on this year because

271
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,820
it was useless nobody was paying any

272
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,960
attention so those kind of standards are

273
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,960
the second part of my life that's me

274
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,520
thank you I'm gonna be talking about

275
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,950
some of the work done at the National

276
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,120
Labs and a particular Lawrence Livermore

277
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,730
through the Department of Energy and

278
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,830
we're looking at the st. sustainability

279
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,910
from the point of view of our energy

280
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,300
sources

281
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,880
so we one of the one of the initiatives

282
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,160
at Livermore is the National Ignition

283
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,590
facility which is working on it's the

284
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,150
world's most powerful laser it's

285
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,390
figuring out how we can sustainably

286
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,310
produce fusion power we talk about

287
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,100
energetic materials at the lab which is

288
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,349
pseudocode for things that go boom and I

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,400
don't work with that part of the lab

290
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,320
another initiative we have within the

291
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,390
do-e is advanced manufacturing with ties

292
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,460
into what John was saying earlier again

293
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,720
not my part of the lab my part of the

294
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:52,490
lab is looking at the electric grid so

295
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:57,230
for example California had about 330,000

296
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,150
EVs put on the road between 2001 2011

297
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,790
and 2018 about a seven-year period

298
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,770
we plan within California in the next

299
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,829
seven-year period to have five million

300
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,010
EVs on the road about half the evie sold

301
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,620
in the US are bought in California so we

302
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,910
have a vast increase in the demands that

303
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,910
we placed on our electric getting

304
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,530
electric grid in California also there's

305
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,329
a new rule going to effect next year in

306
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,360
California that all single family

307
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,610
residences and smaller apartment

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,380
buildings must have solar panels placed

309
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,990
on the roofs and now we have new

310
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,000
production being put into the grid so

311
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,090
what we're looking at is how we can

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,640
incorporate these escalating demands and

313
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:40,130
new dispersed distributed energy

314
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,890
resources into the grid in such a way

315
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,850
that it will be as reliable as it was

316
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,290
for us and for our generations before

317
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,820
this is a real challenge because many of

318
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,400
the devices that are being put out into

319
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,030
the grid so the Internet of Things has

320
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,459
come to the grid every every charger you

321
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,410
see has a computer in it okay the

322
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,850
inverter for your solar panel and the

323
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,219
real-time automation controller for that

324
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,990
inverter our computers so now we have

325
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,750
computers pervading the electric grid

326
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,880
but they're not built with security

327
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,590
specifications that someone like me

328
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,540
somewhere the background security would

329
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,000
want to see by the way I'm not

330
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,160
sustainability expert at all so I'm take

331
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,390
John I'm his perfect complement okay I

332
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,250
don't know anything really about

333
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,750
sustainability other than liking

334
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,020
electric vehicles and things like that

335
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,650
so so we our task is to build a castle

336
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,900
in the swamp

337
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,819
if you think of the Monty Python and the

338
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:36,410
Holy Grail skit where we yes we don't

339
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,710
get four chances at it though we have to

340
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,209
make it stay up the first time so I'm

341
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,330
leading a couple of projects looking at

342
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,640
that at EVs at solar inverters third

343
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,620
project we're looking at is looking at

344
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,360
the firmware that's in these devices so

345
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,330
for those of you who are in the room for

346
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,620
the Intel talk at 1:15 a lot of the

347
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,420
issues that he was discussing about

348
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,790
trusting that low-level software that's

349
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,279
in your device we're looking at some of

350
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,079
those we have a project at Livermore

351
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,570
called the ROS compiler tool kit that

352
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,990
can do binary analysis and so we're

353
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,700
using that to do analysis of the code

354
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,810
that's coming on devices from

355
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,850
manufacturers looking for

356
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,349
vulnerabilities so we're trying to

357
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,760
attack and the sustainability problem

358
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,710
from the bottom up and giving us better

359
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,310
energy resources my a my name is Hany a

360
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,480
bazooka link so just like any good

361
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,520
person serving on a panel the first

362
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,550
thing you look at why are your cool

363
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,680
panelists right so I noticed there are

364
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,490
very very little common chance that we

365
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,949
will meet in real life name serious only

366
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,900
can make that happen so I try to find

367
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,300
some common thread between between us

368
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,170
that relates to what I do I'm interested

369
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,089
in nuclear reactors security and so how

370
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,329
does that relate to financial market you

371
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,370
know behavioral science biological so I

372
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,660
think the common theme here between all

373
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,450
of us is that we're all looking for

374
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,740
patterns try and find patterns to make

375
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,410
decisions based on them so in

376
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,940
engineering we write physics models and

377
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,949
eventually turn them into computer codes

378
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,020
and we use them to control systems those

379
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,779
are all based on patterns that humans

380
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,310
can see and then hopefully we rely also

381
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,110
on the computers to see these patterns

382
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,849
and automate our ability to find these

383
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,350
patterns the same thing you know in the

384
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,680
financial market you're also trying to

385
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,970
find patterns of misuse and when we

386
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,709
couple that with you know machine

387
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,029
learning artificial intelligence we're

388
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,489
just trying to make this process more

389
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,260
efficient more accurate but the thing

390
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,000
that I would like to I think point out

391
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,550
in this talk hopefully will come through

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,650
to you is that like the previous panel I

393
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,740
think professor Clifton mentioned that

394
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,600
that we have to distinguish

395
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,950
what we can do and what the machine can

396
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,840
do what we are good at and what the

397
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,640
machine is good at so how does that

398
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,910
relate to what I'm doing I'm interested

399
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,560
in nuclear reactors first 15 years of

400
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,240
microwave was focusing I was

401
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,550
interpreting the word sustainable to

402
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,050
mean good economy improving the economy

403
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,660
of the system and making sure it's safe

404
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,729
so safety to me means that things can

405
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,100
break but it doesn't mean that the pipe

406
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,680
will probably conspire with the control

407
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,020
rod and you know and a sensor to give

408
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,430
you false information so that led me in

409
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,020
the last four years to look into the

410
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,310
security aspect of things that's when

411
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,720
there's conspiracy and that's usually

412
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,599
driven by a human

413
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,130
so the challenging part here is when

414
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,990
you're talking just about system falling

415
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,580
apart on their own there's no conspiracy

416
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,980
and you can write models for them you

417
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,679
can detect patterns and you can develop

418
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,870
AI techniques to do that but once humans

419
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,580
are involved in the loop every time you

420
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,010
see a pattern they change their pattern

421
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,240
so you know we know each other two

422
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,860
friends know each other for how many

423
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,420
years can you still predict their

424
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,070
behavior so I think that's what makes

425
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,810
the security problem more distinguished

426
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,669
from the safety and the economy problem

427
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,720
is that if we just rely on AI solely

428
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,700
technique machine learning type

429
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,410
techniques it's gonna be challenging so

430
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,080
maybe we have to rethink a little bit

431
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,290
how how we do some design these these

432
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,230
patterns as we try to identify these

433
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,700
security threats and the detection of

434
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,500
these patterns obviously will depend on

435
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,870
how much the attacker knows about use

436
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,340
going from extremely being on the

437
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,409
outside to being part of your

438
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,120
organization and you know when you read

439
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,040
some of the statistics about threats

440
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,719
coming from the inside you feel like you

441
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,930
want to fire everybody that works for

442
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,520
you but this is this is a reality today

443
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,040
so we have to take that into account

444
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,840
when we're designing detection pattern

445
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,480
detection techniques whether you want to

446
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,399
call them AI or machine learning or just

447
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,670
statistical inference techniques so it

448
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,670
was that

449
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,840
thank you do you have any questions for

450
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,560
one another while people maybe come to

451
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,330
the mic and well I think I'll comment on

452
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,470
something Haney said so one of the

453
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,330
projects were working on the Eevee

454
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,620
project is less about the security

455
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,570
aspect and more about the safety aspect

456
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,899
as I mentioned we're looking at growth

457
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,700
up to 5 million TVs and if everybody

458
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,230
plugs in at the same time the grid can't

459
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,390
deal with that so we're looking at how

460
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,060
we can schedule those charging sessions

461
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,310
so that we we smooth out the demand on

462
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,740
the grid so for that project we're

463
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,960
really are working more in the safety

464
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,880
space we are concerned about security we

465
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,870
are we are looking at making it so that

466
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,240
these collaborative charging nodes can

467
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,159
detect when one of them goes goes rogue

468
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,360
or has been maliciously hacked but the

469
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,970
first order thing we're looking at is

470
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,070
safety and then with the this solar

471
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,200
inverter project we are looking at this

472
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,550
sort of conspiracy where someone may

473
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,620
have hacked into the central controller

474
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,060
or some of our nodes and getting that so

475
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,800
so we are seeing some of the same issues

476
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,800
crop up across different disciplines

477
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,050
John did you want to add anything or no

478
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,470
let's get some questions the audience on

479
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:50,290
the spot we have questions from the

480
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:58,030
audience we're gonna call on people

481
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:59,490
otherwise yeah yes would you describe

482
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,170
the difference between cause and effect

483
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,460
local versus cause-and-effect its scale

484
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:08,820
and how that factors in the

485
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,820
sustainability all of us

486
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:19,580
go for it cause and effect local where

487
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,559
to me is engineer I'm looking at a

488
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,980
single effect or single physics or a

489
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,990
single component and what I look for

490
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,150
here is can I reverse engineer that

491
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,540
process or can I learn it from observing

492
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,010
how the system behaves and we to

493
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,190
validate my understanding of build

494
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,870
experiments to test my understanding by

495
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,700
changing one parameter at a time and

496
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,139
just see the effect on the system and I

497
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,260
think this problem is very very well

498
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,850
understood we can we can rely on AI and

499
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,790
machine learning and inference

500
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,559
techniques to build such models but when

501
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,750
you start talking about multiple systems

502
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,250
being put together then there's there's

503
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,799
all these cross products and cross

504
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,820
effects that go between them in

505
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,889
principle you can model them and that's

506
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,100
why in the last 20 years you hear about

507
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,950
high fidelity advanced models

508
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,899
multiphysics multi scale all these

509
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,850
coined words basically mean building

510
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,530
much more comprehensive models but

511
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,439
they're really all still based on our

512
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,780
understanding of how the system works so

513
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,790
if we have much more powerful computing

514
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,220
then this still cause an effect across

515
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,730
systems can still be described now can

516
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,309
we do that using AI depending on who you

517
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,770
talk to but I personally believe a AI is

518
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,629
very good once you have a one of our

519
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,970
previous speakers said you have a good

520
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,890
knowledge e of your system and you have

521
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,720
good data that you can train your

522
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,820
ontology on well if you don't have a

523
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,740
good description of the system then I

524
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,210
think I will be giving you spurious

525
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,919
correlations or things you can't explain

526
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,900
and you end up spinning your wheels

527
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,059
trying to understand what they mean so

528
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,280
the answer is I think with these

529
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,899
exascale computing quantum computing all

530
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,549
these computing power that we have yes

531
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,299
we can understand the cause of effect

532
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:02,200
for a multi scale big big system

533
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:06,220
basically did that answer the question

534
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,860
so I was just gonna add one quick thing

535
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:13,190
some things in life are important at an

536
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:18,439
overall level and you know could be

537
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:21,409
spatial could be long-term time temporal

538
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,510
scale but sometimes more local effects

539
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:26,220
are important

540
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:29,789
years ago we used to do an industry

541
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:33,539
short course and we'd say well somebody

542
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:36,210
walks in they've got one foot in a

543
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:38,190
bucket of ice-cold water another foot in

544
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,350
a bucket of boiling hot water and

545
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:44,159
somebody says well how you doing say

546
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:47,760
well on the average pretty good so

547
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:52,830
sometimes the the the average and the

548
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,408
overall higher higher order perception

549
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,899
has meaning but sometimes it's the local

550
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:00,299
things that matter water is a local

551
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:03,330
issue it in terms of environmental

552
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,950
sustainability and I talked that was

553
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,129
Donna Cummins yesterday and they

554
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,529
mentioned that a lot of their plants now

555
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,019
they're having to ship in water for

556
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,840
their production processes so that

557
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:19,080
becomes kind of a local sustainability

558
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,029
issue we don't always appreciate it here

559
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,389
in the Midwest the water is a global

560
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:27,120
challenge on the other hand because of

561
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:30,539
mixing and so forth things like co2 and

562
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:36,090
other global warming greenhouse gases

563
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:38,879
you know these are everywhere in terms

564
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,860
of local versus global when you look at

565
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,320
the grid the historic electric grid is

566
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,629
very much you can think of it as Center

567
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,450
out or top down tree structure we have

568
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,880
centralized generation transmission

569
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,830
lines going to distribution networks

570
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,510
like you see in any neighborhood what's

571
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,189
happening as we bring on for example the

572
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,990
solar powers in California are they're

573
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,549
distributed energy resources because

574
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,340
we're starting to have production at the

575
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,990
edges of the grid and when we look at

576
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,240
what's happening with electric vehicles

577
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,279
the next step of technology is something

578
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,950
called v2g vehicle-to-grid

579
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,649
so traditional charging we call v1g I

580
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:17,039
think that's a retronym it was added

581
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:19,018
after v2g was brought output so so v1 G

582
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,789
is just charging v2 G is actually my car

583
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,590
can now push electric power back out

584
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:28,710
into the grid so my car is now a mobile

585
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:31,260
generator and demand for electricity and

586
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,409
so coordinating that is an interesting

587
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,240
problem but so we're looking at

588
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:38,310
distribution grid issues

589
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,110
if we're managing our distribution

590
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,450
distribution grids better that takes

591
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,850
load off of our transmission grid all

592
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,590
right and when you I'll employ a time on

593
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,520
a trick of taking a word you said and

594
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,209
answering a slightly different question

595
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,190
you asked about scale so when we're

596
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,830
looking at the grid certain things we

597
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,710
have minutes two hours to solve the

598
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,330
problem it's we know what what a demand

599
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,340
curve looks like fairly typically we

600
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,110
have day ahead markets we can predict

601
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,480
what the demand will be tomorrow roughly

602
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,389
so we can decide some charging

603
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,880
scheduling well in advance but for other

604
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,190
applications such as frequency

605
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,360
regulation or voltage regulation we need

606
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,250
to be making decisions within about a

607
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,379
four second or a sub-second interval and

608
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,660
so we're doing the centralized

609
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,860
distributed computation and so we have

610
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,430
real questions about how well we can

611
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,409
scale our local solutions up because of

612
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:33,420
these time constraints so we see scale

613
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,970
in that dimension as well more thing

614
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,090
also from a security perspective which I

615
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,710
think about a nuclear reactor somebody

616
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,600
who's trying to cause an alicia's

617
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,250
outcome to the reactor they could think

618
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,750
about the coupling between the local and

619
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,630
global effects we may have a lot of

620
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,310
monitors that the operator sees that are

621
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,440
maintained as long as you're maintaining

622
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,330
the same power you maintain certain

623
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,070
margins then your operating fine but

624
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,350
there may be some local effects that are

625
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,000
being initiated different parts of the

626
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,419
reactor that eventually accumulate over

627
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,620
time causing global effect that at that

628
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,000
point you would understand where it came

629
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,310
from and you would have to shut down the

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,870
reactor so if you understands these

631
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,429
patterns at the local level on the

632
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,959
global level from the attacker

633
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,960
perspective you can start thinking about

634
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,600
how to introduce these changes and cause

635
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,850
an outcome that you know would basically

636
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,959
they will have to shut down the system

637
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,959
and try to figure out what happened

638
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,060
okay so for the underlying like control

639
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,200
systems you were talking about for

640
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,909
controlling power grids mostly for Steve

641
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,460
have you found any really interesting

642
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,110
solutions these IOT companies have done

643
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,780
or received any pushback from

644
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,060
manufacturers when you have tried to put

645
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,740
sort of regulations in for the

646
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,560
manufacturing of those things so we

647
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,080
don't do regulation okay but what we do

648
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,970
is build technology solutions we're not

649
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,250
allowed to compete with industry we work

650
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,110
with industry partners we come up with

651
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,640
solutions to problems that may not be

652
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,770
the same way they're looking at the

653
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,510
problem and then we work with them to

654
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,900
see if what we've come up with can help

655
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,270
them

656
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,250
for example now both of the project I've

657
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,990
talked about mostly the evie project and

658
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,570
the the solar project are relatively new

659
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,340
they started last October coincidence

660
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,520
when I started at the lab so that's just

661
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:22,449
I said hey here - you're new here take

662
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,670
on two projects I said okay so with

663
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,220
Eevee we're working with a large network

664
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,340
operator of charging stations and we're

665
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,500
developing our solution in software that

666
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,780
we will be installing we're using

667
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,990
raspberry PI's as as as mock-ups for the

668
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,000
moment we will then be porting our

669
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,100
software to their charging stations

670
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,200
deploying them in a testbed to see how

671
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,010
they work and then see whether they

672
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,660
think that's something that's

673
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,879
commercializable that's actually the

674
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,890
part of the problem I understand the

675
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,510
least that's that happens in year three

676
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,600
is figure out how to commercialize this

677
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,800
technology and part of it is it's a

678
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,689
complete reversal of the paradigm

679
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,820
everybody in these industries works with

680
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,920
very much centralized cloud-based but

681
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,179
still centralized solutions we're trying

682
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,780
to move away from that and go to

683
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:10,540
decentralized edge based computing so

684
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,310
that we can ameliorate certain kinds of

685
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,409
attacks we're removing single points of

686
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,889
failure from the system okay so it's a

687
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,600
it's we do technology and then we work

688
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:24,790
with them to try to try to get an

689
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,080
integrate into their products something

690
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,740
to change focus a little bit or attempt

691
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,220
to at least so John you had pointed out

692
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,770
the beginning that you often sustainable

693
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,470
can be equated to green manufacturing

694
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,129
often or energy efficient and energy

695
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,810
efficient

696
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,360
is prevalent in many discussions right

697
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:46,300
now as well as cybersecurity but they're

698
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,010
not often teamed together there's

699
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,830
actually a Department of Energy grant

700
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:53,830
right now actually taking a look at at

701
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,780
some of these type of things so and then

702
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,750
if when we take about power generation

703
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,440
power distribution and even the economy

704
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:06,040
that often we talk about security means

705
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,470
availability and and stability so but if

706
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,250
we try to put these together are there

707
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:14,620
cyber cyber physical systems security

708
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,650
whatever it may be that actually can add

709
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,719
to green technologies more than just

710
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,330
making sure that the power grid is there

711
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,730
and available and not attacked and that

712
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,500
are that the power generation is safe

713
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,630
those type of things or that are

714
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,510
manufacturing is safe but can these two

715
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,550
very discipline very different

716
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:39,700
disciplines come together that security

717
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:43,360
can actually be a green technology well

718
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,970
let me start and I and I'll confess that

719
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,070
I don't have the answer but you know

720
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:53,560
like a good faculty member I can stand

721
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:58,810
up and talk without knowing what I speak

722
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:01,510
yeah so so and just his background I

723
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:05,980
will note that the the government has

724
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:10,440
been sponsoring millions of dollars of

725
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,440
work in the area of smart manufacturing

726
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:18,070
which I guess parallels the development

727
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,430
of smart everything else these days

728
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,820
smart phones and smart highways and

729
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:30,400
smart this and smart so because I'm a

730
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,639
manufacturing person I'm also often

731
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,800
called upon to try to figure out what

732
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,290
this big idea means in terms of

733
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:44,110
something that's more implementable so

734
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:49,210
as we are pursuing these areas of smart

735
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:50,620
this generally means many more sensors

736
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,059
than we have been using

737
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,820
previously in a manufacturing

738
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,540
environment be it on a process or a

739
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,669
system enterprise-wide

740
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:04,860
could be even on products throughout

741
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:07,360
their lifetime and then using remote

742
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,479
communication technology you know

743
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,929
wireless communication technology

744
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:17,740
sending this information to some central

745
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,480
point where decisions the data is

746
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,470
analyzed and decisions are then

747
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,330
formulated and communicated back to the

748
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,480
whatever-it-was process system product

749
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,850
so this then becomes smart Pratt's smart

750
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,040
manufacturing smart products now if we

751
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,990
do not figure out how to secure these

752
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:42,300
communications we are going to have a

753
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:48,220
world of problem we have problems now

754
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:52,710
we're basically high-tech manufacturers

755
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:55,300
have kind of cut themselves off from

756
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,929
modern communications because of the

757
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:02,020
fear of being hacked making secure

758
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:04,929
product important products and maybe

759
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,360
military type products they they want to

760
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:11,470
avoid that so this is kind of a

761
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:17,919
pervasive ubiquitous problem that we

762
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:19,690
need to address all right professor

763
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,850
doesn't know what he's talking about so

764
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,410
if you notice the last several years

765
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,480
also the Department of Energy has been

766
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,900
talking about these hybrid energy

767
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,429
systems trying to you know maximize the

768
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,320
performance of all the different types

769
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,380
of energy a production sources that we

770
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,820
have like nuclear wind solar all share I

771
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,440
mean despite the differences in

772
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,470
technologies they all share a common

773
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,960
goal climate you know change issues and

774
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,520
greenhouse gases etc so as we couple all

775
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,410
these different systems together there

776
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,360
will be a lots of different byproducts

777
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:51,910
out of it like if we start thinking of

778
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,949
how do you secure the supply chain for

779
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,320
all of them when you start putting them

780
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,240
together I think by product you will

781
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,790
learn about their vulnerabilities we can

782
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,380
put them together so they see looking at

783
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,789
the security will help you ensure that

784
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,960
they're also safer from

785
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:06,940
in point of view with like you will

786
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,960
discover a lot of things that you did

787
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,479
not have to think about when you were

788
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,460
looking at single system so I think

789
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:15,460
that's in a way an indirect effect of

790
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,429
using security to understand the

791
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,279
vulnerability about your system I think

792
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,859
it convinced people to take a high-tech

793
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,679
solution you have to convince them it's

794
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:28,779
secure and that it won't be taken away

795
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,960
from them I lose function I give you an

796
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,960
example if if electric cars are less

797
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,059
safe than gasoline cars nobody want them

798
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,639
so we have to ensure people they're

799
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,729
safer they're more secure they're better

800
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:44,289
they're more reliable etc to push people

801
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,149
to make the greener decision to go

802
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,559
electric the electric cars are

803
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,728
interesting to me because in ten years

804
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,700
time we're going to have 20 million

805
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:52,690
lithium batteries we need to recycle and

806
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,409
that's not a very environmentally

807
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,840
friendly problem but at the moment we're

808
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:01,629
hedging our bets that by then someone

809
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,649
who found a way of monetizing recycling

810
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:10,029
Tesla batteries so our children

811
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:13,000
basically but I think security cyber

812
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,859
security and security is foundational to

813
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,319
convincing people to take a more

814
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:18,790
technologically advanced solution over

815
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:22,569
something they're familiar with which

816
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:24,219
which whether it's green or not greener

817
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,899
I should say isn't attribute of why

818
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:27,668
people want the new thing but if it's

819
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,440
not safe it's not secure if a hacker

820
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:31,388
could take it away from you or break it

821
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,970
the hacker can steer you off the road

822
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:36,250
and believe me I drove a Subaru with

823
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:37,808
lane control last night and I would have

824
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,949
arrested me if I'd followed me it was

825
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:42,490
all over the road and there was no

826
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:46,328
hacker involved even but convincing me

827
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:48,549
to take that it's got to be safer and if

828
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:51,369
it's greener that's a compelling reason

829
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:53,799
to switch but if it's greener and unsafe

830
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,659
there's no way out you know whatever it

831
00:34:53,799 --> 00:35:00,520
is that's the societal dimension yes

832
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:02,319
sustainability yeah so I I have a Tesla

833
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,089
Model 3 I did not buy the autopilot

834
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:07,420
stuff but they had a free trial last

835
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:10,299
fall there you go there's a there's a

836
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,520
particularly interchange in near where I

837
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:14,980
live in California where an entrance

838
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,990
ramp onto a highway divides into two so

839
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,000
you go from a normal Lane to a really

840
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,470
why'd why shaped lane with no centerline

841
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,700
for a while and then there's a

842
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:26,200
centerline and my car did this until it

843
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:33,580
found a lot until I found the second

844
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:36,868
line then it was happy so one of the

845
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,430
things that I'm pushing for on four

846
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:41,080
initiatives to comment win in the lab is

847
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,140
going to be more use of formal methods

848
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,860
because you Simon talked about trust

849
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,180
yeah

850
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:50,590
and so to trust the system you want to

851
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,160
be able to make statements about what it

852
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:56,200
does and right now when how many people

853
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,540
how many people know that you use

854
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,890
digital signatures whenever you download

855
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:04,420
software all right okay so I mean in the

856
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,520
background when you're updating your

857
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,970
apps they're digital signatures going on

858
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,280
all right

859
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,990
and there are signed certificates there

860
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,910
but all that really tells you is that

861
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,319
this came from Apple or Microsoft

862
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,819
wherever you're downloading from it

863
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,330
doesn't tell you what that software does

864
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,860
and that's what we want to do more of as

865
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,470
a mouth quote outgrowth of some of the

866
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,020
work in Rose is being able to testify

867
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,029
and prove to you things the software

868
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,220
does or does not do so that you can have

869
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,710
higher confidence in the software so

870
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,850
that's one of our methods of working on

871
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,490
some of these problems with Internet of

872
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,618
Things and firmware updates is is can we

873
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,169
make provable statements about the

874
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,820
behavior of the software doesn't really

875
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,800
directly answer your question but it's a

876
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,090
way that it's a way that it can improve

877
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,560
the trustworthiness of some of these

878
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,619
systems that people want to move to and

879
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,390
then overcome some of the reluctance of

880
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,590
manufacturers perhaps to open up their

881
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,660
systems to communicate with the outside

882
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,869
world if we can prove to them that

883
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:03,640
certain problems can't occur they may be

884
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:07,210
more willing to do that this question is

885
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,450
really for Simon looking through your

886
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,550
printed bio here I saw he holds a number

887
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,859
of patents on diverse topics such as

888
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,840
authentication encryption smart matter

889
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,049
which is the one that kind of caught my

890
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,359
eye

891
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,000
yeah and I'm wondering if you can speak

892
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,850
a little more to how cyber security

893
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,640
factors into your process for developing

894
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,160
a physical product like this I'm

895
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,690
assuming

896
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,839
something like the plastic you were

897
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:35,690
talking about in your introduction and

898
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,808
if it if it involves a supply chain like

899
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,960
how how do you how to cybersecurity

900
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:46,670
factor into your choice and selection of

901
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,960
vendors and you're you're very sure so

902
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,549
the smart matter patent so I had the

903
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,289
privilege of working for Intel for a few

904
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:54,619
years and I also ran the pattern group

905
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:56,900
for McAfee so I got to patent any I got

906
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,150
to explore patenting anything I wanted

907
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:03,789
so drones and smart matter were top

908
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,530
picks at the time I always look at

909
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:08,660
things I'm trying to bring to market and

910
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,480
I always pessimistically look at how

911
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,930
they could be misused and that usually

912
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,760
involves how can some bored teenager

913
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,720
subvert my beautiful thing and make it

914
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,539
ugly so and that that person that

915
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,609
permeates my entire life I mean when I

916
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:27,079
hire contractors to work on my house if

917
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,460
I can't pay them electronically I don't

918
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,780
do business with them I'm not going to

919
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,490
go to the bank and get cash because what

920
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,020
if I'm robbed you know what if they

921
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,669
claim I didn't give them the cash so I

922
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:40,940
look at the cyber and the security angle

923
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:43,130
in everything I do from from the point

924
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:46,700
of view of how could things be misused

925
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:48,230
because if you know if I see lots of

926
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,220
people with Dell was for instance if I

927
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,289
could demonstrate that I can make that

928
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,669
Dell catch fire right now you've never

929
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,089
used it again and you never buy another

930
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,150
Dell

931
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:58,130
so Dell themselves do a lot of work to

932
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,039
make sure that can't happen that they

933
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,630
can't that battery cannot be misused you

934
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,900
know there are so many protections on

935
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,549
overloading it power charging etc to

936
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,990
stop somebody subverting the beautiful

937
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:15,109
thing of a Dell laptop into a little

938
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:16,879
explosive device so smart matter but the

939
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,859
challenge that I was trying to explore

940
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,220
and this comes into your world is how do

941
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:24,410
you how do you measure the corrosion and

942
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,899
the integrity of a vessel that you can't

943
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,359
physically put a person into to inspect

944
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,980
so smart matter started with what have

945
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,299
we just poured a whole bunch of cameras

946
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,490
into the vessel and got them to float

947
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:35,809
around and measure everything well how

948
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,549
do those cameras interact with each

949
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,660
other to work out the geometry of the

950
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:40,910
inside of the vessel and that's a

951
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,029
standard mesh problem how do they know

952
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:45,120
where they're touching or

953
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,500
the edges are and then if you had that

954
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,240
fantastic system that you could just

955
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,680
pour this smart matter into something

956
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,439
can get all the characteristics the

957
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,549
internal geometry etc how do you know

958
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,350
the data you're getting out it's

959
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,150
trustworthy so that's now when

960
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,880
cybersecurity comes in to and supply

961
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,730
chain so when you get that buck of smart

962
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,710
matter that you know it's gonna have a

963
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,030
function that it's predictable because

964
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,590
you're pouring it in a nuclear reactor

965
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,810
and the answer determines whether you

966
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:12,140
have another Three Mile Island so that's

967
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:15,630
where my that's where cyber security

968
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,480
comes into something as we as out of

969
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:21,780
bound as as some smart matter that

970
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,700
you're you're doing and if you probably

971
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,840
probably seen the movie twister you know

972
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,970
you throw those little things up in a

973
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,010
hurricane and measures it how do you

974
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:31,049
know they're right how do you know some

975
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,550
teenager hasn't compromised them or

976
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,680
China hasn't been involved in the supply

977
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,180
chain or how do you have utter

978
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,160
confidence that the data you're getting

979
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,839
which is so critical it is accurate and

980
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,040
protected and that that permeates

981
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,050
through everything I did some work with

982
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,810
farmers of a couple years ago who are

983
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,040
building rain sensors in their fields

984
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,690
and the design had no concept of

985
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,840
security whatsoever no concept of

986
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,610
integrity or authenticity of data and I

987
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,410
asked them or what what's to stop some

988
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,570
other farmer just telling you your

989
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,549
fields don't need watering and it was

990
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,990
like why would anyone do that it's like

991
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,160
because they're bored that's all it

992
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,379
takes in the cyber world

993
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,210
somebody's bored or somebody wants to

994
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,590
cause a famine and it's the same as

995
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,570
McAfee made a huge error four years ago

996
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,970
of publishing a paper on how to

997
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,100
compromise insulin pumps embedded

998
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,049
insulin pumps which was hysterically

999
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,080
funny until we realized Dick Cheney had

1000
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:28,950
one and then it wasn't funny at all so

1001
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,920
that's where cybersecurity permeates our

1002
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:35,009
lives because anything electronic or

1003
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,050
digital if it was misused or lied to you

1004
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:40,020
if you couldn't trust it anymore you

1005
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:43,560
wouldn't use it and that's how we we

1006
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,720
regress I think yeah let me let me add

1007
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,940
one thing and and then maybe you can

1008
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,470
we'll try to pull you into the

1009
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:54,930
discussion so so one of the things that

1010
00:41:52,470 --> 00:42:00,750
years ago that came up

1011
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:03,720
we were working with Ford and they they

1012
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:07,589
use a polymeric material plastic and

1013
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,509
making injection molded parts but the

1014
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:13,380
supplier wouldn't reveal the the

1015
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:16,289
composition of the plastic and of course

1016
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,880
you know that's perhaps you know some

1017
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:20,460
good thinking behind that because

1018
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,640
they're afraid that then Ford would say

1019
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,039
well why don't we send this out for bids

1020
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,799
and we'll we'll get a better deal in the

1021
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,990
plastic well when we start thinking

1022
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:33,690
about sustainability and now we have to

1023
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:36,410
communicate information about processes

1024
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:39,359
and components across the supply chain

1025
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:42,509
well how do we secure that how do we how

1026
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:48,210
do we protect somebody's intellectual

1027
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:50,539
property and and yet get the information

1028
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,950
we need in order to understand

1029
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:57,359
somebody's footprint well I don't know

1030
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,460
I've got a policy question for you guys

1031
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,390
let me go out here first I want to make

1032
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,279
sure all our audience gets in a

1033
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:09,740
brainstorm about two minutes ago on

1034
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:12,390
sustainability so things like

1035
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,038
manufacturing or or building trades

1036
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,410
there's some vast amounts of waste and

1037
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,819
say the building's forty to fifty

1038
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,368
percent of this stuff is just thrown

1039
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:22,230
away because poor cutting and tolerance

1040
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:24,150
isn't that sort of thing so we named

1041
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,789
where we could shorten that make to

1042
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:29,400
design process efficiency in these ways

1043
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:32,160
is a really solid candidate for

1044
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,680
improving I'm gonna venture the same is

1045
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,200
true in manufacturing as well so we need

1046
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,970
to advances some things like robot robot

1047
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,270
and robots we have a pretty good notion

1048
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,980
of geometry in small areas but our

1049
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,559
robots don't really talk outside they're

1050
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,630
closed world so that's that's my

1051
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,640
adventure to sustainable we need AI

1052
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,720
systems that can interact with the

1053
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,759
outside world

1054
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,700
to make these things far more efficient

1055
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,290
in terms of as I said in that building

1056
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,180
trade area where there's so much waste

1057
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,790
we just don't have enough money or

1058
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:09,940
capital or skilled people to build that

1059
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:11,050
much housing 50 years so once again I'll

1060
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,670
ask you to talk about things you don't

1061
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:17,829
know anything about I think AI is a

1062
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,200
really great contributor to efficiency

1063
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:23,170
it's hard to elude the efficiency away

1064
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:29,680
from sustainability less weight more

1065
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:31,450
sustained so I get I guess I built five

1066
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,730
houses my family's builders for five

1067
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,328
generations and cut patents is a very

1068
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,740
interesting conversation you know there

1069
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:39,910
are when you build a house and houses

1070
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,319
are based on certain standard size

1071
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:46,480
materials to reduce wastage the

1072
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,020
challenge is most of the cost is people

1073
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,930
and you're not going to get a standard

1074
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,759
builder to do a cut pattern analysis on

1075
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,200
a piece of material he's just gonna cut

1076
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,609
it in half and throw half of it away and

1077
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,589
we are used to the cost of cost of

1078
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:05,470
construction there's no there's no

1079
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:07,299
compelling driver I think to reduce it I

1080
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,790
think you're right that it's massively

1081
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,280
more expensive than we it could be but

1082
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,470
until we fight to reduce prices we won't

1083
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,270
be able to demand higher tech solutions

1084
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,220
and you're talking about bringing a you

1085
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,589
know a CNC cutter on site to cut

1086
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,459
materials which I would love as a

1087
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:26,619
technologist but I know that the typical

1088
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:30,460
construction teams I've seen would

1089
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:33,790
destroy it immediately they would drop a

1090
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,710
concrete on there was something because

1091
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,650
they make money on wasted materials

1092
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,540
they're still profit for them yeah it's

1093
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,490
an interesting call yeah I'm personally

1094
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,079
a big proponent of AI as long as you

1095
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,910
understand the process you're basically

1096
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,740
giving the computer clear instructions

1097
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,598
look for this objective function change

1098
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,310
these variables then it's a clear

1099
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,780
process and just the ability of the

1100
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,509
computer to do that very very fast

1101
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,859
something that we can't do but my my

1102
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,780
meaning reservation has always been

1103
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:00,610
asking the computer more than they're

1104
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,070
trained to do you know

1105
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:05,590
the usual usual example is it's easy to

1106
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:07,060
train your child to the friendship

1107
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,790
between a cat and a dog but it's not

1108
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,200
easy to train a quantum computer to tell

1109
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,680
the difference between a panda and a

1110
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,450
everyone for example so as long as we

1111
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,799
have a clear way to tell the computer

1112
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:22,990
how to do then the optimization AI

1113
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,240
definitely should be should be used but

1114
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,640
when it comes to security I think would

1115
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,799
seem for this conference the patterns

1116
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,690
come from humans which are very

1117
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,160
difficult to predict so and at that

1118
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,290
point I think we should take AI with an

1119
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,830
grain of salt and decide exactly what we

1120
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:41,710
can do with it I'll just make one

1121
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,810
comment I a couple years ago I was

1122
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,010
attending a conference and I was talking

1123
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,100
about smart and sustainable

1124
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:51,070
manufacturing using less energy there

1125
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:54,630
was a speaker from Komatsu that talked

1126
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:58,600
about construction and so construction

1127
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,850
you know and and you know surveying type

1128
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,120
thing and this is these types of jobs

1129
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:08,920
have historically been very well-paid

1130
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:11,440
you know for you know people that

1131
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,020
perhaps do not have a college degree but

1132
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,900
that's all changing so you know now you

1133
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,720
have drones that go over and kind of map

1134
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,850
out the region you got 3d images of and

1135
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,819
then they'll throw it into the software

1136
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,680
and now you can just get some young I

1137
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,930
was gonna say kid but that's kind of a

1138
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,020
pejorative so a young person without

1139
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,029
much education that's driving a tractor

1140
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:37,030
and they can just you know use the

1141
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:39,460
joystick to follow and they you know you

1142
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:41,500
don't need to be paying somebody $25 an

1143
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,410
hour anymore you can pay them $12 an

1144
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,810
hour to just do the grading of the

1145
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,180
overall and soon send it out when they

1146
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:54,549
say yeah yeah yeah and then it does all

1147
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:58,480
autonomous right I have I have a policy

1148
00:47:54,550 --> 00:48:00,490
question for you then so at the Purdue

1149
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,020
Policy Research Institute we talk a lot

1150
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:07,569
about how technology is ahead of policy

1151
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,070
and that it'sit's always playing

1152
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,260
catch-up to have the right regulations

1153
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,170
to have laws on the books and that

1154
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:18,000
technology is way

1155
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:20,240
of where we are mayor Pete Buda judge

1156
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,250
who's running for the Democratic

1157
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,459
presidential nomination talked recently

1158
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:29,430
about that in the United States we

1159
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:33,380
basically have no tech policy and that

1160
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:37,288
as a result corporate tech policy is

1161
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:39,900
essentially public policy for technology

1162
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:42,660
in the United States so I guess I'd like

1163
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,819
you to comment on that do you take that

1164
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:48,660
to be the case that corporate tech

1165
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:50,308
policy is our public policy and maybe

1166
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,078
Simon from the corporate world could

1167
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:53,339
speak especially but in general what

1168
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,569
would you say to that what does that

1169
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:59,880
mean for sustainability and

1170
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:02,009
intersections with cybersecurity so by

1171
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,369
tech policy you mean our responsibility

1172
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:08,309
to protect things and do things right or

1173
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:10,829
I think in it's so much of the

1174
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:16,920
discussion that's very broad issues of

1175
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:19,349
privacy yeah security safety force

1176
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,740
impacts all the ethical legal social

1177
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:25,019
implications of technology that are not

1178
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,808
really addressing I still have sleepless

1179
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:31,319
nights about the Clipper Chip I don't in

1180
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:34,319
the room remembers clipper when

1181
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,549
governments dictate technology I mean it

1182
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,109
takes them five years to break the

1183
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:41,460
policy and the text five years old by

1184
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:43,319
there and it's changed so I I spent 20

1185
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,089
years with data protection and I love

1186
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:47,460
the fact that more and more governments

1187
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:50,788
are holding the world accountable to

1188
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,319
protecting our data like it's not the

1189
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:54,690
bank's data when they lose it it's ours

1190
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,210
mine when the hospital lose my health

1191
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,609
records is my data not there so I love

1192
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:02,609
the fact there are financial penalties

1193
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:04,529
and huge embarrassment and all it took

1194
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:06,779
was without shall protect people's data

1195
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:09,119
so it's a very the policy there is not

1196
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:11,460
very broad not very deep it doesn't

1197
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,930
describe technology and how but it says

1198
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,369
you should use best efforts to protect

1199
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,509
people's data and if we think you didn't

1200
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:18,660
it's going to be embarrassment and fines

1201
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:21,109
that's enough and we can get better at

1202
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,730
that but I never want to tip over into

1203
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:25,288
you shall use this particular algorithm

1204
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,490
or firewall because it's just going to

1205
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:30,030
be outdated doesn't one

1206
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:32,209
size doesn't fit all in terms of

1207
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:34,410
MasterCard for corporate sustainability

1208
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,420
etc these are all things that

1209
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,879
differentiate the company from our peers

1210
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,710
that we do because it makes us more

1211
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,470
competitive we do them because they're

1212
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,270
good as well we like being good but

1213
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,339
let's but it helps our share price and

1214
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:51,450
that's always a good thing should

1215
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:54,420
government step in if industry's messing

1216
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,919
up yeah like if we didn't value

1217
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,050
something and there was no competitive

1218
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,250
advantage governments need to make us

1219
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,890
care and that's what they did with data

1220
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:05,100
protection they made it harder not to

1221
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:09,540
care and then that turned it into a

1222
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,980
thing the world thought highly of and we

1223
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:15,840
could compete on it helps our share

1224
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:18,450
price and then we care in terms of tech

1225
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,640
policy I I would love the governments to

1226
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,350
ban big coins and cryptocurrencies

1227
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,560
because you know people don't realize

1228
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,360
bit the bitcoins farming of the world

1229
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:32,340
now consumes more electricity than

1230
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:33,900
Ireland it's great for you guys yeah but

1231
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,369
Jesus we're worried about charging

1232
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,280
electric cars and we have these things

1233
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:41,820
like terabytes of terawatts of power for

1234
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,650
nothing that would be a nice government

1235
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,990
policy thou shalt wait not waste

1236
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,960
electricity on crypto coins well unless

1237
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:51,330
you generate it yourself maybe but it's

1238
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,080
dangerous when government steps in the

1239
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:58,109
talks technology they need to talk about

1240
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,270
kemal you to society like the evils of

1241
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:02,580
losing your identity is something that

1242
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:04,740
companies should aspire to protect and

1243
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,970
then companies say well we're better

1244
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,310
than everybody else cuz we do that

1245
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,290
really well and that is that changes our

1246
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:12,140
world yeah I think you pointed out that

1247
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:15,630
the two industries I'm familiar with

1248
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:18,359
being health care and banking both have

1249
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:21,869
laws in effect that put the onus on the

1250
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:26,310
industry to do to do policing and and

1251
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:30,869
conform to standards on the Bitcoin

1252
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:33,930
front people are amazing and everyone is

1253
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:36,030
a natural game player from a game

1254
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:39,060
theoretic perspective so there's a town

1255
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,059
in southern Washington State that turns

1256
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,529
out it had really

1257
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:44,319
cheap electric power because it was

1258
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:47,469
right next to a hydro facility and so

1259
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,329
the entire town ger into a giant Bitcoin

1260
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:51,939
mining facility wasting it

1261
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:54,039
yeah because because it was cheaper you

1262
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:59,140
it was just so cheap to get electricity

1263
00:52:54,039 --> 00:53:00,279
there I share Simon's reluctance to have

1264
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,719
government getting involved in

1265
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:06,069
technology I think when you look at the

1266
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:09,369
DMCA which is a couple of decades almost

1267
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:12,400
decades old now that's another example

1268
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:15,999
of over specifying technological bounds

1269
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,829
within policy and that it made it very

1270
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:24,339
difficult to do certain kinds of reverse

1271
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:26,439
engineering and I think that the

1272
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:29,619
challenge for regulators is to define

1273
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:32,549
the policy in a way that addresses the

1274
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:34,959
shortcomings in existing legislation

1275
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:37,749
that is relevant to new technology

1276
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:39,489
without over specifying the responses

1277
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:43,299
that the technical and the forms of

1278
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:45,219
technology can take yeah that your

1279
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:49,029
example I love that because that's kind

1280
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:51,549
of the think global act local right so

1281
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:53,410
yeah that's good I was just gonna come

1282
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:55,538
out one other thing because this is

1283
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,879
starting to emerge more and more often

1284
00:53:55,539 --> 00:54:00,400
we spent I'm an engineer right so we

1285
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,059
spend a lot of time thinking about how

1286
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,429
to be more efficient and and you know

1287
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:10,449
whatever it is we're doing try to you

1288
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:11,829
know really do a good job but when you

1289
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:13,719
talk about the Bitcoin and the

1290
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:15,910
government intervening in that this is

1291
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:18,640
this is the government deciding about

1292
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:22,660
what we should be doing which starts to

1293
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,839
get into the area of effectiveness which

1294
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,089
is more about how should we be using

1295
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:32,130
energy you know should we be using our

1296
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:34,509
critical resources for scooters and and

1297
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:41,679
yeah start really sounding like an old

1298
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:45,099
person so so but but these are the hard

1299
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:47,349
choices right the value choices the you

1300
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:50,170
know where we need the ethics and we

1301
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:54,430
need you know the

1302
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:56,319
beyond math and science - to help guide

1303
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:58,180
our and help us make the better to say

1304
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,890
this is the topic of what's the

1305
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,160
long-term impact of things we do the

1306
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:06,038
sustainability of it is it short-term

1307
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,690
are we leaving a pile of poop behind for

1308
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:11,049
our children or is this a sustainable

1309
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:12,819
thing that's improving the economy in

1310
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:17,190
the long run improving everybody's

1311
00:55:12,819 --> 00:55:21,058
ability in the long run and with that

1312
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,059
thank you very much panel

1313
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,220
you
