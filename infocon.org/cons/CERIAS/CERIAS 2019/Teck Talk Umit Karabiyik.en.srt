1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,370
okay let's say I start with the first

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,048
Tech Talk for the day I have to say I

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,179
ran upstairs for a minute just to check

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,950
on something and those industry people

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,650
just didn't have the technology figured

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,940
out so they con down here the Tech Talk

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,690
everything's working everything's fine

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,820
sure enough so it's my pleasure that to

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,039
introduce professor lumen Kirby

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,789
he's a professor of computer information

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,769
technology here at Purdue University and

12
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:31,170
rather than dwell on his background and

13
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,940
expand if you like a little but I don't

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,920
want to take away in at his time so for

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,968
the next half hour so please enjoy so

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,309
good afternoon everyone

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,300
after the lunch snacks of the year

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,468
already so is the professor to see IT

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,879
department here on campus of 30 so

20
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,010
primarily my research is actually on

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,739
visual or forensics and cyber security

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,269
you know problems relate to the forensic

23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,250
aspects and this talk is going to be if

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,979
you can deal with forensic

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,390
investigations this talk is going to be

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,189
interesting when you look at the first

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,020
word in the title is a targeted part

28
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,548
this is going to be the more interesting

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,369
part because you might think you know

30
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,130
you only extract data from little

31
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,750
devices which is not a big deal but when

32
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,390
it comes to the targeted departments

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,369
kind of something different so if the

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,229
title is targeted forensic data

35
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,400
extraction for mobile devices and this

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,549
working to these funded by NIJ it's been

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,290
in three years project so we've finally

38
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,020
brought to the and then release the

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,259
final product so let's get started

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,579
so my outline is actually briefly I'm

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,759
gonna be talking about introduction and

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,990
motivation in this work and the actual

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,340
problem with the problem which is

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,130
relating to the target of the extraction

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,369
and some high-level system design that

46
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,570
we developed a normal system design and

47
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,610
little bit details about the tiger the

48
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,570
data extraction system and then I'm

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,310
going to be talking about briefly

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,600
experiments and results in completely

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,700
visual work so what do you think about

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,060
the digital forensics you might have

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,700
heard this in different you know content

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,290
but this in general is actually at the

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,670
intersection of computer science

56
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,069
discipline and forensic science

57
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,890
discipline basically the techniques we

58
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,109
use that those are usually in computer

59
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,600
science information technology you know

60
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,580
the base techniques we use to collect

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,329
evidence or information for forensic

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,640
science purposes so usually the forensic

63
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,880
investigators are dealing with the the

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,130
acquisition examination analysis and

65
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,840
reporting of every school of evidence

66
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,019
which are collected from traditional

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
devices in order to do that we use

68
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:47,760
presidents or digital forensics tools

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,738
and they basically provide high level of

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,220
abstraction for the investigators to

71
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,950
perform the process the whole process

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,930
acquisition examination analysis and

73
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,929
reporting process and make it easy for

74
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,790
investigators and usually the evidence

75
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,700
collected from these devices by using

76
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,000
the tools are using this civil or

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,619
criminal cases mostly to delay the

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,530
computer incidence of crimes so why it's

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,660
becoming an issue in today's technology

80
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,370
when we are introduced to so many

81
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,750
different technologies that we call the

82
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,459
Internet of Things right now we actually

83
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,900
tend to tie everything to be there are

84
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,900
some things because they are all

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,250
connected so why they're in front either

86
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,260
really important in the forensic

87
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,120
investigations is simply because we have

88
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,310
tremendous amount of information is

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,620
being saying in to the various different

90
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,959
devices through the synchronization

91
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,480
actually we double maybe exponentially

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,549
increasing you know deformation saving

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,260
our devices so the problem of the

94
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,959
forensic investigators perspective how

95
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,269
we can get specific information from

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,859
these devices particularly we focus on

97
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,140
the smart phones because they are

98
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,209
actually becoming personal the wonking

99
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,820
and the problems we are going to discuss

100
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,890
from the criminal or criminal justice

101
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,560
perspective is becoming really an

102
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,390
interesting problem so as we open all

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,980
these on smartphone sector to keep

104
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,290
significant amount of you

105
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,470
type of information from our location

106
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,560
serve and beneficial services at home we

107
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,358
have information every every point of

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,339
time that some you know certain

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,349
intervals the invocation is to be

110
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,690
reported and saving to the entire

111
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,090
choices not to mention the pictures

112
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,650
videos will take and messages you know

113
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,109
all these conversations including our

114
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,130
email communications somehow saving some

115
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,810
stretchers in these races so say C is

116
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,070
actually recognized as a personal

117
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,260
belongings personal device is not like a

118
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,880
computers when it comes to the criminal

119
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
cases

120
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,479
Griffin veteran students write it right

121
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,169
away California case the court actually

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,740
is being start to accept the forms are

123
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,840
being investigated should require a

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,650
specific search warrant what it means

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,739
really before writing the vs. California

126
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:07,349
the McCain was really if there's no

127
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,419
suspect getting a cell phone get the

128
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,810
cell phone because there's a probable

129
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:15,270
house and the cell phone actually is you

130
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,919
know falls under the case of the general

131
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,130
search warrant but specifically right

132
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,109
now starting from 2014 the court

133
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,110
actually is issuing very specific search

134
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,610
warrant for a specific data let's say

135
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,220
there's a crime they've been last night

136
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,710
from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and the

137
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,870
court says you need to get you know on

138
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,580
text messages and associated pictures if

139
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,039
there's any from that time frame

140
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,950
specifically and today's tools that we

141
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,460
discuss do not actually help with this

142
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,270
case

143
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,120
so our scope of research is going to be

144
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,320
then so when the restricted search is

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:56,550
given to the investigators can they both

146
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:58,889
legally perform the investigations and

147
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,930
only look at those information and from

148
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,490
the user privacy perspective can you

149
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,840
protect the privacy of users while

150
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,750
investigating video devices

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,590
so then become the significant problem

152
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,150
and for example the nation

153
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,619
if the week the more witnesses bring

154
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,750
their devices to the police or law

155
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,260
enforcement for any case if they witness

156
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,750
the case or victim of a crime so there

157
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,150
is no tool in the current literature

158
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,950
that allows actually them to look at

159
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,890
specific information from these devices

160
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,420
what happens then with the services do

161
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,219
not bring the inference because they

162
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,470
might have some personal information in

163
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,780
difference so how can we the question is

164
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,300
how can we handle I can allow how can we

165
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,460
allow investigators to extract specific

166
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,620
information from the crisis without

167
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,659
compromising the privacy of users and

168
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,710
also at the same time protect the

169
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,900
investigators you know by keeping their

170
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,270
boundaries or investigation boundaries

171
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,520
along the lines of the given consent

172
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,409
bars from the from the victims or

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,409
witnesses so our solution is targeted

174
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,270
data extraction system again our

175
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,700
assumption is basically making sure that

176
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,740
the devices are well internally go out

177
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,370
to the law enforcement and consent is

178
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,920
given for a specific information solve

179
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,080
the simple scenarios that could be a

180
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,570
mass shooting and there are some vectors

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,820
oh very classical example for this is

182
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,190
the Boston bombing because basically the

183
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,040
case was resolved with the all witnesses

184
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,260
bringing the pictures to the law

185
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,240
enforcement and also surrounding cameras

186
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,670
the CCTV cameras we were capturing some

187
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,630
of the videos and and and frames they

188
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,360
were actually used by law enforcement

189
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,890
and those informations are used if the

190
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,600
victims wouldn't bring this information

191
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,210
to delay enforcement there were they

192
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,220
really difficult identified suspects and

193
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,260
some of them like everyday problems

194
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,660
probably boyfriend/girlfriend breakups

195
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,469
and if they actually goes to the violent

196
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,670
you know lines one of them is actually

197
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,650
it's presently the other cyber

198
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,030
harassment in this case Wickham could

199
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,099
have even bringing the device to the

200
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,080
police and police would only look at the

201
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,710
specific information without looking

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,570
rest of it as hyperbole is a significant

203
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,729
problem in the circles that could be

204
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,150
also one problem because the the mind is

205
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,830
actually do not tend to

206
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,940
you know talkable law enforcement

207
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,159
because they might also keep some

208
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,040
information in their phones and that

209
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,870
might be close you know problem for them

210
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,570
so they've achieved so the parents

211
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,120
actually if this tool is well available

212
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,979
then parents would they be actually

213
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,260
easier than bringing the devices without

214
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,779
violating the treasure so for you on

215
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,270
kids

216
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:40,120
so what I'll see that are targeted data

217
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,929
extraction system allows basically it

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,060
has three significant components we can

219
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,699
say and they are mostly tied to do

220
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,369
subsystem components that I'm going to

221
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,500
be talking about next so first of all we

222
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,410
care for metadata fishery so this is

223
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,380
actually interesting we not surprisingly

224
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,180
it's not very supported by the state

225
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,810
most of our tools that are being used by

226
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,640
law enforcement they wanted only the

227
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,589
only ones actually allow visit with the

228
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,510
recent update is the data data and type

229
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:17,529
of filtration by the celebrate pouch is

230
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,450
specific to the others the rest of the

231
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,860
information is only allowed to dump the

232
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,860
category of information to the computer

233
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,290
for example do you need only one contact

234
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,850
information from the device but it only

235
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,189
allows you dump dump down all the

236
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,260
contacts to the computer and find that

237
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,930
one on the contact which is actually

238
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,730
totally you know privacy issue because

239
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,979
you may not want to share rest of the

240
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,860
contacts we did for us but it's true for

241
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,560
the pictures and also text messages so

242
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,110
maybe metatheory allows us to basically

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,689
search information within the given

244
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,150
consent if the date time location or

245
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,920
even types of data is specified by the

246
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,810
user then they are going to be extracted

247
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,459
based on this information and the

248
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,319
content-based filtering is using the AI

249
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,180
techniques particularly machine learning

250
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,529
deep learning techniques there are on

251
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,959
specific models that I'm going to be

252
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,850
talking about we use them to in order to

253
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,089
understand what's in them in the images

254
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,290
so that we can actually only extract the

255
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:15,799
development information from the device

256
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,569
pictures in the device and obviously

257
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,699
since this is a visual forensics system

258
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,669
and it has to follow the proper chain of

259
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:24,649
custody so we make sure this is actually

260
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,269
full also I have little bow on corner

261
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,009
flow is not going to reject packets or

262
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:31,489
if the findings are going to be

263
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:33,739
admissible it departed so the three

264
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:37,009
subsystems will be used to meet these

265
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:39,139
criteria simply is the identification

266
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,389
system is making sure the filters are

267
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,850
the most available filters are used and

268
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,229
applied so that the the data is

269
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,509
available we know where the data is

270
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:49,609
exactly and we know which table is going

271
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:51,609
to be extracted so the sub the second

272
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:54,589
supplement data acquisition system will

273
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,509
forensically by using forensic sadness

274
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,119
will extract these information to the

275
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,559
device and making sure again none of the

276
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:02,779
irrelevant information is going to be

277
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,939
extracted from the devices and data

278
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,160
validation system at the end will making

279
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,349
sure that everything that is actually

280
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,209
extracted is not modified during the

281
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,399
transition they have that could've been

282
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,858
a problem otherwise if the evidence is

283
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,629
not reproducible it's not admissible in

284
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:20,289
the car so that would be a big problem

285
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:22,279
so we make sure the extracted data is

286
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,980
extracted in the friends in the same

287
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,529
manner and it's not its integrity is

288
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,480
preserved and it keeps the water on the

289
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,939
chain of custody making sure what has

290
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,919
been done where and why we keep all this

291
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,329
information and obviously generates

292
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,199
investigative report has all other

293
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:43,248
system determined so the identification

294
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:47,029
system specifically is looking at the

295
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:51,169
form W business right it's what happened

296
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:53,449
when happened and where and which is

297
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,799
perilous so we pretty much like try to

298
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:57,679
answer all of these questions that

299
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,389
usually investigators are looking for so

300
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,639
again these are not in the general

301
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,949
domain we look at very specific

302
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,389
information that are related to these

303
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:10,339
questions and it actually works with the

304
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,779
data along with there are data

305
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,930
identification system all these

306
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:15,480
information is done

307
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,310
the data acquisition system and metadata

308
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,470
filtering and along with the admission

309
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,000
learning can be applied depends on what

310
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,950
the investigator is actually looking for

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm going to show you the interface for

312
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:30,149
that too so it is very interesting when

313
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,720
they restrictions and also

314
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,570
availabilities in both platforms iOS and

315
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,089
Android platforms I mean both of them

316
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:43,130
were actually the markets 99.6% so we

317
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:45,870
focus on these two so there are some

318
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,850
information that we can extract by using

319
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,450
data extraction system there are some

320
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,480
information we can't big house first

321
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:57,390
since they the assumption is that we

322
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,760
assumed if the phone is voluntarily so

323
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,069
we don't wanna group the one that means

324
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
like we don't wanna get the hood access

325
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,770
to the poem by violating the on the

326
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,140
warranty and or because an iOS device we

327
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,770
don't want to jailbreak so when we talk

328
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,390
to them

329
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,640
unfortunately there's some limitations

330
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,770
so we can perform on device

331
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,290
investigation or off device

332
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,959
investigation when we do on device meta

333
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,760
base extraction or investigation we can

334
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,400
do actually pictures we just contacts

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,439
like calendar events reminders you know

336
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,569
significant amount of information they

337
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,209
are provided by the native applications

338
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,320
in the phone and in the in the entry

339
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:40,529
part is is little restricted with this

340
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,209
security perspective we believe for some

341
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,610
reason it doesn't allow us to extract

342
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:47,459
the messages and Kobach's directly what

343
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,760
we do instead we take a night to speak

344
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,739
up in a secure location without letting

345
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,080
the investigator to look at the content

346
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,970
but our totally gotta go through that

347
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,950
without revealing the rest of the

348
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,450
information to the investigator and look

349
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,420
at those

350
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,070
permission system so we at the end by

351
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,050
using the own device or off device

352
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,020
investigation we are able to extract

353
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,400
target information for significant

354
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,650
amount of information when it comes to

355
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,209
the third-party applications it's a

356
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,890
little problematic for the Android

357
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,680
perspective even though if you have the

358
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,500
root access if you are given with access

359
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,060
you know voluntarily from the witnesses

360
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,970
or victims so they were the owner of the

361
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,420
finest then we can have full access to

362
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,360
any of the the third-party applications

363
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,540
unless they are their data's income so

364
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,030
in this case for my us we have more

365
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,010
capabilities exit to extract but for

366
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,750
entry we are actually very limited

367
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,060
extracting the information from the

368
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,310
third-party applications but again the

369
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,010
assumption is we are not going to route

370
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:52,030
or jailbreak the informant form if you

371
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:55,460
will be then they will even all yes

372
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:59,150
unless again if there is any encryption

373
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:02,210
enhancer so we how do you perform the

374
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,340
metadata based on extraction so if you

375
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,140
look at the architecture for ims the

376
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,020
frameworks them that are available on

377
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,810
the system is system on top of the

378
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,430
structure we have cocoa touch that

379
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,089
actually where this is a kind of like

380
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,579
application layer we can run the

381
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,630
applications in that layer and access to

382
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:26,360
do to the other frameworks in the lower

383
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,610
layers in the framework so media library

384
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,130
is basically lost to get the information

385
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,680
from the pictures and videos and some

386
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,210
audio as well so it's a library allows

387
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,979
us to access these information

388
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,080
now only they are meta information so we

389
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,820
can access all the information and check

390
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,070
whether they're within the boundaries of

391
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,210
the given consent so that we can extract

392
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,860
the whole information in the core ml

393
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,900
framework is a very important of

394
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,630
framework for us so we can deploy our

395
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,949
machine learning models so that we can

396
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,780
run and look at the content of the

397
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,480
pictures and visiting development

398
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,150
information for networks and if you are

399
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,330
familiar if in order to run a machine

400
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:09,720
regular deep learning models in in smart

401
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:12,120
devices that say on green positive

402
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,400
here the GPU it actually is used more

403
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,440
than the CP is being used so in today's

404
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,510
these mobile devices there's a

405
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,880
significant improvement so that we can

406
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,420
perform our investigations passers so we

407
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,610
use GPU for that purpose and Rea this

408
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,240
it's slightly different but a similar on

409
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,620
the structure on top of the architecture

410
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,890
stack we have an application layer

411
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,630
wherever we deploy our app so that app

412
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,569
is going to have access to the rest of

413
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,830
the frameworks and the content provider

414
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,620
framework is the one of the most

415
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,500
important frame wall structure I can say

416
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,960
that the exactly framework it allows us

417
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,570
to look at the meta information in the

418
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,720
third-party applications if the

419
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,630
developers allow data sharing among the

420
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,380
apps what it means really for example if

421
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:04,199
you if you open your like Facebook app

422
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,699
on your you know device then it asks you

423
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,520
to access to your contacts

424
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,500
image gallery in above the rest of the

425
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,660
informations that's actually how the

426
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,640
applications are sharing information

427
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,860
through the content providers those are

428
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,780
mentioned in the manifest files and

429
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,030
based on them giving permissions the

430
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,579
applications can share those information

431
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,189
what we do without looking at the actual

432
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,919
information we look at on the meta

433
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,880
information so we do not compromise they

434
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,280
given given content or in the the

435
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,840
criminal case we do not go beyond the

436
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,740
specific search warrant given by the

437
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,510
court or judge and some of some other

438
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,850
frameworks actually allow us to look at

439
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,890
the media pictures and videos and

440
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,300
content of them and then some of the

441
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,250
signal light libraries allow us to

442
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,020
retrieve information from practically

443
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,060
being third-party applications if it is

444
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,690
available because information is kept in

445
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,100
the databases and again we use GPU most

446
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,330
of the time and when it comes to the

447
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,040
machine learning

448
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:07,280
deploying the machine learning models

449
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:10,610
that's actually very very fast

450
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,190
versus playing so this is this is the

451
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,800
structure how apps are communicating

452
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,710
through the content providers so RT this

453
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,360
application so we have to show you one

454
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,250
case how it actually connects to the

455
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,080
other databases and share information

456
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,450
it basically through the cursorloader

457
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,689
all the other applications communicate

458
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,810
with their own data database files and

459
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:35,780
this is one actually two way you know

460
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,480
kind of bus that information can be

461
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,490
shared through our application and rest

462
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,590
of the other applications so this is

463
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,300
actually being done through the content

464
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,209
providers and so it's a great

465
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,560
opportunity for us and we do not foresee

466
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,900
that this is going to change in the near

467
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,090
future because the newer Android devices

468
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,050
are also entering operating systems are

469
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,209
still using the content providers so how

470
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:03,830
we use machine learning

471
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:05,750
so simply as we all use with the you

472
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,389
know machine learning in any device we

473
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,270
have our own model right so we double

474
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,220
our model and then basically train the

475
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,660
model based on some database so well

476
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,210
some information we provide that

477
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,810
training set and then if it is needed

478
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,640
which we train the model again based on

479
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,550
the base of the classifications we need

480
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,730
and then eventually you know deployed

481
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,940
into it our smart device so that they

482
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,470
can actually pair from the they Tech's

483
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,430
well not even exception in this case

484
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,730
data filter so what book specific

485
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:44,150
machine learning frameworks we use we

486
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,950
use tensorflow and cafe frameworks test

487
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,280
our form is simple almost designed by

488
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,410
Google Cafe is the Berkeley Laboratory

489
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,040
is a our anniversary's these are

490
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,110
actually very powerful

491
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,670
frameworks and the models I'm going to

492
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,560
discuss which models we use but they

493
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,740
allow us actually to perform

494
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,300
significantly faster data extraction

495
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,490
compared to the other frameworks

496
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,100
available and entering the specific

497
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,020
using type so polite I would like to

498
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,209
mention this might actually became

499
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,930
available just one

500
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:19,000
year ago so when it became available the

501
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,840
size of our application is reduced from

502
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
76 megabytes to seven memory and at the

503
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,149
same time we had significant performance

504
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,490
increase so that's why I will switch our

505
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,990
tensor physical life at that time

506
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,350
unfortunately I guess didn't support

507
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,780
them so tensorflow

508
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,810
of the open-source software library for

509
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,840
machine learning you know applications

510
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,340
and we specifically use two different

511
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,010
models in section with we enroll in it

512
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,889
and they are trained on the image in s

513
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:54,400
database 1.3 billion pictures in there

514
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:57,280
in day of the the model categorizes the

515
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,560
the input file to the thousand classes

516
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,960
which is actually significantly large

517
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,230
number so we were only focusing on

518
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,540
specific set of you know output colors

519
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,100
you know classes so I'm going to be

520
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,230
talking about they were they were not in

521
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,419
the database or be aged in between the

522
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:17,590
model and make it fit for our system or

523
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,750
cafe is developed by the birthday our

524
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:24,520
research and we specifically is open I

525
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:27,550
said and I said then and it's W sorry -

526
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,379
SW model so this nation is also

527
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,480
significantly faster model when compared

528
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,830
to others so this is specifically used

529
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,440
for this next version I'm going to be

530
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,179
skipping this part because this Greek

531
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,550
guy talked about it basically look at me

532
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,610
the inception v3 model actually is 14/3

533
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,800
layer model so the learning so

534
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,800
combination new network is used in the

535
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,909
middle of the the model so we basically

536
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:57,040
look at edges shapes and and lastly or

537
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,770
close to the final layers we are hiding

538
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,899
features and in the last three layers we

539
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,820
do classification so for that reason

540
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,750
since we have different classes we

541
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,780
retrain the last three layers to get

542
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,010
specific classification for our

543
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,800
investigating models for what purpose we

544
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,510
use transfer learning idea basically the

545
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,580
model is trained for a specific task

546
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,910
while our test is different however

547
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,669
related to do that

548
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,830
as so we can use transfer learning by

549
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,800
retraining the final layers to make sure

550
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,080
that model fits to our case in this case

551
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,510
being you know train dead and

552
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,949
specifically look at these cases when

553
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,360
these are all identified by the wife our

554
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,030
communication with the boy impersonal in

555
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,209
three different states so we finally

556
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,070
came up with four different cases one is

557
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,960
the definitely weapons day once they

558
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,000
identify with America identify some of

559
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,640
the weapons related to you know cyber

560
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,320
bullying or cyber harassment cases they

561
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,300
say like I'm gonna kill you and send you

562
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,760
no picture of the knife or picture of it

563
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,129
you know God so in those cases we

564
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,260
identified weapons and drug usage

565
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,610
definitely is one of the significant

566
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,040
okay then he turned one case is

567
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,199
basically car crashes the victims

568
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,550
usually take sorry witnesses usually

569
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,440
take the picture of the car when it's

570
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,260
happening and then shave you to law

571
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,260
enforcement and some of the terrorism

572
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:24,680
acts these are related to bombing case

573
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:27,110
specific so when we use tensorflow in

574
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,570
the identification of the weapons as you

575
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,280
see in the in the first picture it was

576
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,230
actually pretty clear that they were all

577
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,129
guns I mean unless they use like their

578
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,260
hands like this

579
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,510
there's also everything that is gun

580
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,100
unfortunately but we have high

581
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,660
probability that these are done in the

582
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,490
second case however there are some other

583
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,400
guns but because of the you know

584
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,710
contrast and the image quality our model

585
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,800
doesn't really you know identifies those

586
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,020
but we just still okay because we still

587
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,510
have one picture here but there could be

588
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,490
some unfortunately some false negatives

589
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,590
and this could have been one of those

590
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,170
also negatives in our investigation but

591
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,060
again we try to have highest level as

592
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,940
possible I'm gonna be sharing the

593
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:12,770
results with you in a moment but in this

594
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:15,260
case we are missing two pictures so this

595
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,629
is the high level device for the design

596
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,850
for the communication so this is its

597
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,540
self also we can cause you know design

598
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,570
because now the tools forensic sausage

599
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,270
this type of you know communication so

600
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,649
we allow the investigators to use VSP

601
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,760
doors in this case should we move this

602
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,770
to the SSD trying positions way faster

603
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,110
this is an SSD drive everything is

604
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,480
working with an assisted driver and

605
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,790
investigators will be just plug-and-play

606
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,370
fashion will run our system on an

607
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,409
operating operating system and they can

608
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,169
use any in your laptop or any computer

609
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,760
in the scene so the reason that we want

610
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,950
to do this because we want to reduce the

611
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,040
cost of law enforcement they don't have

612
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,470
to purchase my $5,000 laptop that is

613
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,510
actually forensically capable of

614
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,810
performing you know evidence collection

615
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,700
or analysis and that could be a Wi-Fi

616
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,560
communication Wi-Fi access point or

617
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,030
Wi-Fi communication depends on the you

618
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,129
know needs to be missing it actually

619
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,040
wants to perform this so we allow both

620
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,930
communication so there are some Catholic

621
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,490
so there are some applications and tools

622
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,560
that are available in the tool they're

623
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,870
going to be automatically more to the

624
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,879
system and then if our app is going to

625
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,040
be pushed to the phone and it's going to

626
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,260
just pop up the consent for an

627
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,540
investigative or investigators and the

628
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,030
users will sit down and give the consent

629
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,100
and then once they approve only they

630
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,980
targeted at the extremities is going to

631
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,649
be connected so this is a Android

632
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,680
interface specifically so this is what

633
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,630
the consent form actually look like so

634
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,030
using the concept from select paper

635
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,920
based but he is on digital version in

636
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,490
this case so we provide them some you

637
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,410
know

638
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,360
some of the information eventually goes

639
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,540
down with the mission learning as well

640
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,370
so based on the information they provide

641
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,860
within these boundaries we don't go

642
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:05,379
outside we do not let the investigator

643
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,629
go outside the phone is locked they

644
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,640
can't do anything else other than

645
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:14,200
looking at the information within this

646
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,210
you know concept so this is the iOS so

647
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,320
we use the two different design so just

648
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,250
to give them the law enforcement to

649
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,490
choose the best option

650
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,120
so I guess has different design them you

651
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,429
know Android is actually looks at me

652
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,010
when we're what you know and who

653
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:33,850
questions usually so we just want to

654
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:36,250
give them a different design so this is

655
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,990
the model how we create the exported

656
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,300
data this is very important from the

657
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,429
forensics now this perspective because

658
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,320
we want to make sure we keep the hash

659
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:47,290
value of all the information we extract

660
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,419
and then save it for the future cases so

661
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,909
that if the if the information is after

662
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,370
by the user victim in this case or

663
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,530
during the communication we can identify

664
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,870
what information is being corrected so

665
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,490
just to make sure that although all the

666
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,739
perform activities are going to be deep

667
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,990
for this by the other investigators in

668
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,640
the case of that the the victim or

669
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:13,900
witness case exit turns to be criminal

670
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:15,670
case the real protection looks like this

671
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,890
is going to provide so many information

672
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:22,470
that are needed for the investigators to

673
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:24,730
testify in court and these are our

674
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,610
devices that we actually tested our

675
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,580
system on so at that time we were

676
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:33,520
actually we had iPhones eight seven and

677
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,800
some other devices so we had populated

678
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,929
the devices with significant amount of

679
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,428
human information mimicking that South

680
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,340
the user might have like thousands of

681
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:44,410
features so in that case how well are in

682
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,850
for me our two inches performs some

683
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,559
people don't really do anything right I

684
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,030
mean they just keep some information on

685
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,800
their phones and they don't like to take

686
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,360
pictures knowing those few people in

687
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,730
their contact list so that's what we

688
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,600
imitate to be they're recovered pretty

689
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:00,669
much like all type of users in this case

690
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,790
so we tested for so many different

691
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,010
categories we look at the pictures on

692
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,500
the videos on a Millikan combination

693
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,090
like the text messages contacts and

694
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,010
related pictures if there is anything

695
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,889
all of these with a different name

696
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,540
information we collected all these you

697
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,600
know values what is actually important

698
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,610
here is the time for our extraction for

699
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,929
it's interesting that we also tested

700
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,699
this against the state-of-the-art

701
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,730
forensic tools that why a person

702
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,250
actually is using so the the time that

703
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,650
takes to you know perform this

704
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,240
investigation is significantly reduce if

705
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,420
you look at it it's just you're talking

706
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,440
about sex and this is very important in

707
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,170
distinction designed by the

708
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,180
investigators is because they don't have

709
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,040
time to keep the you know victims in the

710
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,500
police station during the investigation

711
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,909
because they are going so they have

712
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,530
minutes they are running with the

713
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,240
minutes to get to the length of the

714
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,590
information so that the investigation

715
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,990
can be done otherwise they don't really

716
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,230
want to share the availa imagine you

717
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,660
know 17 years old you have a teenager

718
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:02,970
and leaving the for three hours that

719
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,340
could be catastrophe that's right so

720
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,490
that's exactly why you're targeting like

721
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,280
seconds or minutes I'm having a very

722
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,170
quite quite successful for this and at

723
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,399
the end the way though you might say yes

724
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,160
seconds it because we're running

725
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,770
extracting 10 megabyte that's that's

726
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,260
true but in order to experiment 10

727
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,540
megabytes today's technologies do not

728
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,629
allow this they don't turn it Wiggy

729
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:35,010
going down and then get the tenth but

730
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:36,810
you know megabyte out of it so that was

731
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,580
actually metadata for three and this is

732
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,770
the content-based filtering so he is

733
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,639
again mobile net and he said should be

734
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:46,080
three so our accuracy I've got take your

735
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,300
attention today accuracy is actually

736
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,669
varies you know depending on the type of

737
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,970
teachers we had at that time so we have

738
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,920
really bad thank you so at 25 percent

739
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,660
there was actually one instant instance

740
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,360
actually we had we want to share this

741
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,340
because of the regulation it was from

742
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,740
the different angle and there was a

743
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,929
background of like trees and they were

744
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,070
also there to look like also some you

745
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:12,509
know game so we had very low accuracy

746
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,689
bestop addiction they were pretty good

747
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:19,730
so we can have either solid results that

748
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:27,120
are you know 2h news programming could

749
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:29,100
accuracy the extraction so you can take

750
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,080
a look at these these are all what we

751
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,509
ask you to alternate account these are

752
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,480
all two positives we take them and also

753
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:38,549
to neighbors so we want to make sure

754
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,769
because in the forensic investigator

755
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:43,168
investigation right if you miss

756
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:46,529
something and you say I couldn't find

757
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,779
anything that's a big problem but if

758
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:51,029
there are 10 pictures 10 related

759
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:53,340
pictures to do your case but you can

760
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,960
mark them you're good to go you can miss

761
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,418
the rest of the night that's perfectly

762
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,850
fine but if you miss 10 of them that's a

763
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,559
significant problem when you go to the

764
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,158
court you can't say I couldn't find

765
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,928
anything

766
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,879
maybe the other person they've you know

767
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:11,100
family and when we compare it to the two

768
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:14,240
different of tools magnet axiom and per

769
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:19,289
game at the time so we had significant

770
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,330
you know time right here for example we

771
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:25,139
recovered in the 14 seconds for the

772
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,840
expert in our tool and into 29 minutes

773
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:32,250
for the axiom negative exit to only

774
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,289
extract some comics so and when we

775
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,970
compare with the iOS iOS was actually

776
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,700
problematic when it comes to the off

777
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,200
device investigation if you remember I

778
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,570
mentioned that that we need to extract

779
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,879
the iTunes backup for very specific

780
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,710
information when intellectually involved

781
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,139
we are at the same level as other tools

782
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,700
it takes like minutes but when it is not

783
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:54,360
involve like if you are not interested

784
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,460
in messages then are actually coal box

785
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,240
for example it only takes like 0.1

786
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,190
seconds plus 15 milliseconds so still a

787
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,950
very significant improvement in to you

788
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,389
know interest rate to do time compared

789
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,159
to others because others also take like

790
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,678
10 minutes at least initial time and

791
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,000
nine minutes initial time and turned it

792
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:18,690
eight minutes

793
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,500
extra time plus point four seconds so in

794
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,639
short our tool it's an all investigative

795
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,419
tool for law enforcement being

796
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,399
distributed

797
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,730
unfortunately are currently using and

798
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,439
giving us feedback and we designed this

799
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,330
for the victim or witness cases however

800
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,309
we are so happy that some of the

801
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,840
investigators from New Jersey they

802
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,940
actually using this for the criminal

803
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,879
cases again because they have received

804
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,559
search one from the judge saying that

805
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:48,029
you have to only look at the teachers

806
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,470
and at this time so and it seems like

807
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:51,899
it's actually working well for both

808
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:55,080
cases we can witness samples of criminal

809
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:58,229
cases or tender cases so that's actually

810
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,480
good news and it performs very good you

811
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,179
know results with the metadata it's

812
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,489
hundred-person almost but we did you

813
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:08,609
know content-based filtering we are

814
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:10,590
improving this quality by developing our

815
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:13,320
tools now we are actually developing our

816
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,580
own models for game learning models so

817
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,350
that we can have better eight three C's

818
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:22,350
for specifically for this type of cases

819
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,908
for four different categories and we are

820
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,289
also looking at the some national

821
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:28,169
language processing models and

822
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:30,629
developing our own outwardly for the

823
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:32,159
specific keywords so we are in the

824
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:34,590
interests of getting some information

825
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,119
from the law enforcement data database

826
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:41,519
of some illicit content in the text

827
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,168
messages being shared so by using their

828
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,279
data we are going to train our system

829
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:50,429
and get specific keywords like hatred or

830
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:54,299
you know like training someone

831
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:56,489
threatening words so by using the NLP we

832
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,470
are going to look at these text messages

833
00:33:56,489 --> 00:34:00,470
not only the teachers in this case

834
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,880
that's a very good point you can't look

835
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:18,090
at the pictures that's exactly what the

836
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,220
kids were the New Jersey Amos I told

837
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,380
them I said you know because gonna take

838
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,540
a little time for us to prepare another

839
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,670
system for them I told them my dear

840
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,830
celebrate Tosh because because he said

841
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,139
they only look at the time

842
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,000
and also teachers time and teachers and

843
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,580
I said like you celebrate because

844
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,340
celebrate allows several times

845
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,290
specifically allows the date time

846
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:43,650
filtration he said no no we can look at

847
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:47,070
it because celebrate also shows us the

848
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:49,110
rest of the pictures and we are not sure

849
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,720
that how this is going to be validated

850
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,340
because celebrate is a black box we

851
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,129
don't know how the process is going on

852
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,950
well for our to is open source tool and

853
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,720
we guarantee that we don't look at the

854
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,149
content we don't show the content to the

855
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,069
investigators everything is actually

856
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,840
happening in the background on the

857
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,330
system and we are not showing that

858
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,170
information to the investors does it

859
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:15,720
answer your business and eventually this

860
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,190
actually future ball outside of the

861
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,410
grant actually that wasn't the part of

862
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,230
the crane we are going to look at age

863
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,060
detection it's a significant problem but

864
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,720
we'll be looking at personal some ages

865
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,430
of alternative life because for 17 to 23

866
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,480
is so hard to detect

867
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:36,690
so we hang on look at the above 25 below

868
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,610
12 or 14 so that's what we are going to

869
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,840
do and developing our new models for the

870
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,840
you know crimes against each other

871
00:35:46,830 --> 00:36:05,380
yes for I mean relates to our

872
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:08,050
application we do not this visit be part

873
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,880
of like giving them SSDs right so we

874
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,740
give them a bit SSD drive that actually

875
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,600
has only our applications and

876
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,919
investigates do not you know download

877
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,470
anything there shouldn't be any like

878
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,840
viruses Trojans anything in the SSD

879
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,299
drive a provide that with respect to the

880
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,810
form if there isn't like malware or any

881
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,550
anti forensic applications in the phone

882
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:31,299
we haven't tested that that's a good

883
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:35,920
point but we are not requesting any

884
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:39,280
information from them unless they sounds

885
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,230
like hijack to the content provider and

886
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,270
doesn't allow us to you know get

887
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,410
information given look and that's a good

888
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,960
frame we didn't look at the anti

889
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,220
forensic person you know perspective the

890
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,750
look I will be assuming that this is a

891
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,870
victim of in this case right they have

892
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,550
volunteered to bring their phones and

893
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,359
they would be aware of any anti forensic

894
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,460
tools so forth

895
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,460
I mean application in the phone

896
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,410
wrong extractor the United secure enough

897
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,840
you are able to extract those data under

898
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,000
those that comes with a user agreement

899
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,910
right so what if I just tried to that

900
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,870
get the big money extracted yeah how do

901
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:27,569
you make sure your well they're two

902
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,730
different takes house are a be secure or

903
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,430
house security we extract information

904
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,980
there are two different things

905
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,990
so how every secure we pay attention to

906
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,870
the security of our app whether it can

907
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,459
be hacked or you know because that's

908
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,830
possibly the scope of our you know

909
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,170
design this day prototype system first

910
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:48,420
second home security we extract the

911
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,580
information is perfectly secure while

912
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,660
because we want to make sure that

913
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:56,790
forensic you know process also includes

914
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,920
the data is not altered to indeed you

915
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,420
know communication so we make sure that

916
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,850
that communication if it isn't wired

917
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,040
then it's almost difficult to you know

918
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,290
you know ad-hoc and get the information

919
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,730
from the voice of wireless we want to

920
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,640
make sure that in the investigators they

921
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,390
use their own access points and they are

922
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,609
secure

923
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,710
and they actually aware of this and they

924
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,430
do use those you know secure access

925
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,850
points which is usually being vehicles

926
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,850
thank you very much

927
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,480
you
