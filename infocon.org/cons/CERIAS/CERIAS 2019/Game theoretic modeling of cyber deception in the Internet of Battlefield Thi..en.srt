1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:09,000
okay thanks everyone for coming to the

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,280
serious security seminar tonight - today

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm pleased to introduce our speaker

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,340
Charles Ken wha Charles is with the US

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,860
Army Research Lab he's located in

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,540
Maryland currently spent a previous

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,329
number of years with the with AFRL in

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,220
Rome New York and he's also been at

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,020
educational institutions across the

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,930
country and around the world for a

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:39,030
number of years so his current expertise

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,000
focus is on game theoretic use of cyber

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,400
security and I will also tell you that

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,150
he is just been named as one of the top

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,129
100 federal researchers so that's an

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,860
honor that we're very pleased to

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,110
announce to all that he has earned and

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,879
not only that but he's a new father so

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,829
that's probably the that's probably the

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,850
number one thing on the list so thank

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,280
you thank you

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,600
so with that I'll turn it over to dr.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:11,430
Kim Wong yes thank you for coming thank

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,970
you for your time so we gonna be here

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,860
450 minutes so feel free to ask any

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:23,580
question along the way to our word for

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:26,580
the end and starting with the title so I

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,260
didn't know how many of you just by show

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,520
of hands

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:35,630
hi family I was gimchi oh hey yes so for

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,100
those who are not in the popular culture

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:43,310
maybe you have seen the movie A

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:48,350
Beautiful Mind and that movie feature

34
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:55,950
John Nash one of the father of game Joey

35
00:01:48,350 --> 00:02:00,360
so what about Saba deception yes so

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,840
basically that's a lie but brought into

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,189
Saba so lying in real life is part of

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,370
deception and now we bring those type of

39
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,029
life into cyberspace by lying to the

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,780
attacker

41
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:23,410
we protect ourself what about internal

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:26,620
of thing Internet of thing so basically

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,770
we are part of it if you have a cell

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,640
phone you know that's internet of thing

45
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,819
sense or smart home you know

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,910
self-driving car so all of those feature

47
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:41,640
that you hear are part of the Internet

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,180
of Things even the light that we have

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,609
you know come from its mud great and

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,760
that will be part of Internet of Things

51
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,820
another way to call it will be sub a

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,850
physical system you know that's almost

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:03,970
synonymous to internet of thing so but

54
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,560
you will be surprised to see here but

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:12,519
LaFell Butler feel because we work for

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,610
the army and we are concerned about the

57
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:20,319
butler field and what will be the King

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:24,790
on the battlefield you have a military

59
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:29,380
drone military robot self-driving

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:32,410
vehicle wearable device all of that will

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,579
be part of the Internet of battlefield

62
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:40,510
thing so we're gonna go deeper into

63
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:43,360
those concept and basically why are we

64
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,179
investigating this topic we know that

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,120
the army face intelligent adversary and

66
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,660
the environment is very dynamic very

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,930
competitive and we need a scientific

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:00,880
foundation to understand a competitive

69
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:03,940
dynamic environment we won that at the

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,989
end to be automated to have a quick

71
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:12,400
response time and that's why we are

72
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:15,549
using this type of framework and just

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,399
what I just measure what will be IO BT

74
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,150
or Intel about refuting those who be

75
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,880
self-aware

76
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,810
you know interconnected adaptive

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,550
autonomous you know thing that we found

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,460
on the battlefield and Austin will be

79
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,440
what say so actuators or

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,450
vehicle AHA but you know all of those

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,940
things so they are part of the

82
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,909
battlefield and you have last year a

83
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,890
short definition of game jewelry so the

84
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,730
stage of mathematical model of conflict

85
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,080
and cooperation between aunt Alicia

86
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,350
Hashanah this is your maker

87
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,909
and everyone know that if you have a

88
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,370
butler field basically we have a

89
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:02,030
conflict

90
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:07,130
there's nobody without conflict and we

91
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:11,919
have entries an adversary so making the

92
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:18,640
motivation for game jewelry very direct

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:23,020
so this is our laboratory organize our

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:26,240
on 10 essential research program and

95
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,359
those essential research program at

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,690
their hive from what you see here in

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,480
blue

98
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,480
those are the army chief of staff clergy

99
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,480
and from the chief of sobriety you have

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:42,190
six of them highlighted here we

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,650
formulate essential research program and

102
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,380
basically what I'm presenting today is

103
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,960
part of the set C the seven

104
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,680
electromagnetic technology for compass

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,739
and vahana

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,750
yes the name I have just changed but you

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,120
know I do not actually have the new

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:03,350
slide you know it has been updated a

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,250
little bit and so this our laboratory

110
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,680
and under this project we have the

111
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,800
camouflage and decoy of saben

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,230
electromagnetic activity and I'm working

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,580
on the cyber part and we have another

114
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:23,690
Directorate working on the aw electronic

115
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:28,580
warfare component and that's what I had

116
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:31,790
this card and basically we won the enemy

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,349
not to perceive the true reality we want

118
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:41,919
to project another reality to the enemy

119
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:46,319
different from the counter yes and

120
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,688
bringing that into Saba al-sabah attack

121
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,229
start at the hiccup innocence phase this

122
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,029
the kill chain for sada the kill chain

123
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,430
basically mean you start collecting the

124
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,090
information you discover something the

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,060
hability you explain one of those then

126
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,830
you take control of one machine you seek

127
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,259
higher privilege like administrative

128
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,210
privilege then you go step by step

129
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,599
deeper into the network that's like a

130
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,698
whole movement and you get to your

131
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:19,919
objective you see so that's the Kircher

132
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:25,029
and at the army we want to be proactive

133
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,938
that means that our actual very early in

134
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:33,339
the culture not wait to be compromised

135
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:36,009
and then react to the compromise so how

136
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:37,689
I said I attack walk basically the

137
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:42,279
attacker have to collect information

138
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:44,949
about what note are involved what

139
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,229
application inside each note what

140
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:51,520
operating system do you have what

141
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:54,729
hardware what protocol you know I use

142
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,839
for communication and formulating and

143
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:02,460
those information how variability I

144
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:08,080
discover and if successful cyberattack

145
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:11,020
exploit one or more vulnerability so if

146
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,520
at the beginning we have deception we

147
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,659
have lie we misrepresent our system

148
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,930
basically the attacker will be

149
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:23,860
collecting the raw information about our

150
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:27,520
system and will be launching the raw

151
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,750
attack that will not be successful so

152
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,760
that's what we are trying to achieve

153
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:35,649
here and we have if you challenge that

154
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,490
the device that we have on a battlefield

155
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:41,229
io BT sometime have limited battery

156
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,169
kamesha of the chef at the virginals

157
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,930
they are mobile and working on the

158
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,620
contest unconscious to environment those

159
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,479
are the challenge we face and we have

160
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,970
pre-award that have looked into sub

161
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,480
deception we have a reference for that

162
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,520
at the

163
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,950
and I'm gonna go forward but you can

164
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,740
have time to look digital of those real

165
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,890
friends and basically I gonna show a

166
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,100
scenario to illustrate a standard

167
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:15,730
cyberattack so looking at this buckler

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,160
fear what will happen the attacker will

169
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,170
start looking at a weak link and a

170
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,110
weakling can be one of the wearable

171
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:27,699
device generally kamesha of the Shelf

172
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:31,360
that can have you know enough inability

173
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,000
and since this device connect to others

174
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,630
that will be a good entry point for the

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,810
attacker so follow the buck here

176
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,660
assisted by step what can happen so from

177
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:48,790
that wearable device that can compromise

178
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:52,990
the robot then a few sensor and go step

179
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:56,439
by step deeper into our network want you

180
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:59,500
reach in the command center and when you

181
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,950
reach the command center basically you

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,050
can create the maximum damage so this

183
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:09,880
will be what we call lateral movement

184
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:12,729
and what we just presented is just one

185
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,210
of the putts but in fact there are

186
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:20,710
multiple paths and all those combination

187
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:25,210
of paths can be represented here by what

188
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,940
we call an attack half you see and how

189
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,060
do we get to that a graph that will be

190
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,130
all the vulnerability that the attacker

191
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,660
were able to collect from the

192
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,400
recognizance phase so that it has a good

193
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,860
indication that to get to just note for

194
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,170
his dance this is the way to go or

195
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,080
that's the way to go those are step by

196
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:53,800
step Davina hability I need to exploit

197
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:58,660
to be successful so then our key

198
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:01,780
question is how we can perturb this

199
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,689
attack half by adding some freak node

200
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,839
that will be standing on a pot that we

201
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,300
know about for a long time

202
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,000
adding some fake age that's mafic

203
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,920
application inside note that have an

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,040
ability and how to hide some critical

205
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,829
node or hide some ads so that at the end

206
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,910
by doing all of that the attacker

207
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:32,230
observe AG frank half from the true

208
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:35,110
graph so that now launching a sabe

209
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:40,030
attack such attack can no longer be a

210
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:42,280
successful as what we just presented so

211
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:46,660
this will be server deception in this

212
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,900
context in the nutshell so to say that

213
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,520
in magic tell each of those know that we

214
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,829
have we have a hardware and when hub

215
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,770
which can be at the hardware level from

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:03,690
the other operating system can be our so

217
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:06,640
specific application or even a user

218
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,910
that's where you have those ads on the

219
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,100
attack curve they correspond to specific

220
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:19,180
vulnerability that can be at each of

221
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:22,900
those step and going we formulate if we

222
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,849
nobility multigraph multigraph because

223
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,069
what some to node you can have two

224
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,500
different edge if we have to finish

225
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:36,210
ability that's what make a difference

226
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:40,180
and if you have an edge that means what

227
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:43,780
there will be connected only if our node

228
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,630
v1 you have a venerability and honored

229
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,660
v2 you have an open part that allow an

230
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:53,410
attacker to exploit a vulnerability to

231
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,209
go from v1 to v2 basically that's what

232
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:01,300
we are summarizing here and the top of

233
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:05,830
deception as a highlighted is to a

234
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:08,439
defect node had a critical node increase

235
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,040
the passive or jacuzzi passive value of

236
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,860
that node that is a node level we can

237
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:20,020
also do that at the edge level at fake

238
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,200
age you know hide some edge or increase

239
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,189
or decrease

240
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,920
the potential costs of those variability

241
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,980
and since we are doing gameshow Hetrick

242
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,370
modeling we have also some key factor

243
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,350
that are important like the transition

244
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,949
probability from one state to the other

245
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,260
the monitoring probability how accurate

246
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:45,829
is your monitoring of the attacker

247
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,500
action you see so those are away

248
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:50,630
from 0 to 1 the discount factor

249
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,230
basically showing how patient you are

250
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:57,170
how do you value future payoff compared

251
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,070
to current payoff and it can also be

252
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:04,910
just make a military Network look like a

253
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:07,490
civilian network are many more action

254
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,160
those will be the different type of

255
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,300
deception that we are trying to

256
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,019
understand and optimize so the key

257
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,359
research question that we have in

258
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:25,010
formulators in from using such a problem

259
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,310
is our tree level first will be the

260
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:31,420
initial configuration that's mean before

261
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:36,410
the network deployment how do we

262
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:40,250
allocate the decoy of north and edge in

263
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,920
the network in the attack half where do

264
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:45,800
we create those decoy for the node and

265
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,069
edge and also for the camouflages to

266
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,069
hide what node or what edge should we be

267
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:56,930
hiding in the attack half in a strategic

268
00:14:52,070 --> 00:15:00,529
way you see and the second part is after

269
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:04,310
we have deployed the network and the

270
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:07,250
attacker is detected in one of our decoy

271
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,529
so when the attacker hit one of the

272
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:14,000
jacala we have said how do we

273
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:17,600
dynamically reconfigure our honeypot our

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,230
whole net basically you know so that

275
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,949
will be a key configuration does mean

276
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:28,610
reallocate the edge and note that our

277
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:32,180
decoy or that we are hiding basically

278
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,499
and the last one is the Garlic of nisha

279
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,839
golda cognition mean

280
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:41,279
from the first two step for instance or

281
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:44,729
the attacker how do we predict what

282
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,759
target the attacker is after just by

283
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:50,489
looking at the first two step because by

284
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,289
projecting that we can hit configure our

285
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:57,059
network to better deceive the attacker

286
00:15:54,289 --> 00:16:02,519
so those are the key question that we

287
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:05,488
are trying to address so then to address

288
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:09,419
that we formulate a two player zero so

289
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:12,269
Markov game and that's basically to know

290
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:15,059
the set of state the action available to

291
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,239
the attacker the action available to the

292
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:22,699
defender the transition probability for

293
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:25,379
us here is just 1 or 0 so if the

294
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,598
defender is choosing an edge to

295
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,329
disconnect to prevent an attacker to go

296
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:32,429
forward and the attacker is using that

297
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,579
same edge the attacker will not be

298
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:38,488
moving one step deeper and the

299
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,888
probability will be 0 to change from one

300
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:43,649
step to the next or from one node to the

301
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:44,669
next and if they choose something

302
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,159
different

303
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:50,389
does an advantage the attacker the

304
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:53,509
attacker will be moving the step forward

305
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:56,459
so that's basically 1 or 0 here and

306
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:58,049
other than I describe this a little more

307
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,508
in the next slide what make the

308
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:02,999
difference between the image of a watt

309
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,368
and the future Hayward and this is a

310
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:09,569
discount factor basically showing how

311
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:11,368
patient you know the attacker can be the

312
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,339
more patient attacker will have a

313
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:18,448
different outcome compared to the less

314
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:21,990
patient attacker so from there

315
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:27,089
formulating the game we go to solve the

316
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,889
game by value T ratio and basically be

317
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,899
careful for those who know Markov

318
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,330
decision process you start a Markov

319
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:35,908
decision process but the Markov game

320
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:39,449
because what we have a maximal operator

321
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:42,299
here inside of the max operator because

322
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,700
here we are optimizing against the worst

323
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,279
case is a type of worst case analysis

324
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,240
and worst case member that we have in

325
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,370
front of

326
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,830
an attacker will have the knowledge of

327
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,100
the system very smart you know

328
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:59,179
understand cybersecurity and is there to

329
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,790
maximize the damage so does the attacker

330
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:06,150
trying to maximize the damage and that's

331
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:12,120
a defender minimizing the damage you see

332
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:14,760
and when repeating such a policy so this

333
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,179
will be one of the game in one set of

334
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,790
the game so you have in once that's mean

335
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,030
I see specific note the action of the

336
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,100
defender that's a column player and

337
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:28,680
attacker will be the whole player so you

338
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,750
have the action of every player and you

339
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,950
play the game state by state and

340
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:37,650
iteratively I'm doing that many times

341
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,900
you get to the level when the value of a

342
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,030
note become less than a constant that

343
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,220
you fix generally very small constant

344
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,470
and that will be the convergence and at

345
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,960
the convergence you have the optimum

346
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,140
policy and the optimum value or specific

347
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,100
note so the high level this is more

348
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,410
difficult to answer

349
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,590
we're gonna give you a sample scenario

350
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:01,650
to illustrate that so taking this

351
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,949
scenario we are on the battlefield and

352
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:08,460
an attacker is looking to go left or

353
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:11,610
right so by going left the payoff is

354
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,880
then the image that payoff and by grave

355
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,780
right the image at payoff is hundred you

356
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,080
see so if you have an attacker looking

357
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:26,340
it's just at a short-term payoff better

358
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,460
to go after the hundred you know but if

359
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,320
you do have an attacker looking at the

360
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,800
long-term payoff that attacker

361
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,770
understand that this node have more

362
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:42,149
connection and the north connector to

363
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:45,420
just not have a higher value so imagine

364
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,880
I'd to go on this node knowing that I

365
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,540
have a better chance to get higher value

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,990
in the future and the validation

367
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,360
algorithm solve that nicely in the sense

368
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,660
that give the how patient you are does

369
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,679
mean giving a discount factor and the

370
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,590
optimal policy

371
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,170
at the end that will give you what is

372
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,500
the best option what is the true final

373
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:15,450
value of those node so the key message

374
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:20,730
is that if you have a device isolated on

375
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:25,380
itself that device may was nothing but

376
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:28,500
if you connect that device to drawn you

377
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,220
know important robot and auditing on a

378
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,220
battlefield

379
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,160
to mark critical node because that

380
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,460
device is connected to market condo that

381
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,610
device will be more important so the

382
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,030
strategic decision or what to protect

383
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:48,120
you will not be dependent on taking

384
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:51,210
isolated node and looking at what the

385
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,590
value are in isolation but has to be

386
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,510
connected to the network topology you

387
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,149
know what do they connect with and what

388
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:03,210
is the value of what they are connecting

389
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,750
with so and that's what get illustrated

390
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,260
here

391
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,240
so if looking only at the short term you

392
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,970
just take at the street value of the

393
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,210
node and then going after the node of

394
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,100
value hundred will be better but if you

395
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,850
are more strategic and playing a

396
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:24,929
long-term game may be better looking at

397
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:27,719
the second step and from the second step

398
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,540
you understand that you have a chance to

399
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:35,180
get a very high payoff you know up to

400
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,180
ten tails off so that's the message here

401
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:43,290
we won those type of analysis

402
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,680
understanding what are the more critical

403
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,230
nodes and what are the best course of

404
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,320
action because by identifying the

405
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,320
critical in a connected topology that's

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,760
how you come to know where it is best to

407
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:03,649
apply your cyber deception strategy what

408
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,290
not to hide where to create strategic

409
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,750
honeypot what as to hide and so on

410
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:13,590
and we want that to be automated and to

411
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,480
be automated we need the data and for

412
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,480
today the most comprehensive the

413
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,510
the base that we have on potential

414
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,550
vulnerability is hosted by Miss the

415
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,940
National Trust and our technology and

416
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:30,270
they have what we call the Nationals we

417
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,880
now have rich database so by looking at

418
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,310
that match Lavinia beech database we can

419
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,320
formulate our attack half knowing the

420
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:42,270
note and how the network topology is and

421
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,270
looking at the vulnerability firmness we

422
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:49,110
can build an attack half from building

423
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,770
that attack half we can also find the

424
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:55,350
score of the potential vulnerability

425
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:58,080
using a second database that is the

426
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,480
comma winner which is scoring system by

427
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:08,179
mitre and when you get that you can now

428
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:13,500
learn the attacker goal his pay off and

429
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:16,160
his target and from there formulator the

430
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,410
stochastic game find the optimal policy

431
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,860
the optimal policy you will have will be

432
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,480
buffered attack and defender what is the

433
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,219
optimal policy of the attacker you will

434
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,680
get it what is the optimum for the

435
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,320
defender you will get both that also and

436
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,890
now knowing what will be the optimal

437
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,129
policy of the attacker formulate the

438
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:41,430
best deception strategy you know that

439
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,410
you can have to mislead that attacker

440
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,760
that will be the optimum deception

441
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:50,010
strategy and the cycle continue because

442
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,129
the database is not a static database

443
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:55,140
you can have new phonology added and if

444
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,780
you have new vulnerability that

445
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,020
basically mean edging on the attack have

446
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,899
new edge it can also be that you find

447
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,360
new patch and if you have new patch does

448
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,030
mean you have a solution for those with

449
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,340
ability there has to be removed as mean

450
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,760
removing the corresponding edge on the

451
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:18,270
attack half and automatically you can

452
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:26,550
repeat the process and get your optimal

453
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:28,370
policy soon so that's why we also the

454
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,060
study we use here

455
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,550
is to compare the attacker pair of when

456
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,520
doing nothing when no deception what

457
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:40,010
will be his payoff and now by doing some

458
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,100
specific deception action to know the

459
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,650
value the real impact of that then what

460
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,929
you compare the attacker payoff in a

461
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,910
game where you are pail deception

462
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,100
compared to where we are not applying

463
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:56,320
the deception making the difference can

464
00:24:52,100 --> 00:25:02,659
show how effective the strategy is so

465
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:07,399
and the key factor in social network is

466
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:09,740
to know how quickly can you compute this

467
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,010
optimum policy so that's why the

468
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,530
convergence time is a key factor and we

469
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:19,790
look into the convergence time you know

470
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,980
depending on the the the graph density

471
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,980
the band only probability here because

472
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,960
we have random graph and they hire the

473
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,150
project you put one that's been a fully

474
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,340
connected Network every node is

475
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,740
connected to each other and if you put 0

476
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,459
no node is connected to each other and

477
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:41,150
in between you will have more or less

478
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:45,140
densely connected nodes so looking into

479
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:48,640
that and setting in this case that

480
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,770
bender depravity - 0 / 4 and comparing

481
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,060
the the different discount factor G open

482
00:25:51,770 --> 00:26:00,230
I will be very patient nose 0.9 I will

483
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,720
be very patient and 0.9 no no those are

484
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,910
the value on top yes the less patient

485
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,390
will be the 0.7 the more patient will be

486
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,820
the 0.99 we do have a quick conversion

487
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:14,030
of time on the value iteration algorithm

488
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:17,659
here and that is done with Haunted node

489
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,580
and looking at the char probability for

490
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,420
note that are more or less connected we

491
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:28,750
also have a quick convergence time

492
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:32,540
affair of the policy and we look at

493
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:35,780
different set of strategy and we found

494
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:38,710
out that basically the optimal policy as

495
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,870
formulated here will be a mixed strategy

496
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,540
because what if you are planning

497
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:47,959
as an attacker to use the shortest but

498
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,180
for instance does mean what the defender

499
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,590
can also calculate the shortest path and

500
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:57,380
will always be sure to disconnect an S

501
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:00,110
along the apart to prevent you from

502
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,050
getting to the target and that's it so

503
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:06,649
for other strategies so mixing or

504
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:08,899
randomizing will be the optimum policy

505
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,550
and that optimal policy will give the

506
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:18,380
optimum distribution of randomization

507
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:22,580
here and now we still have to deal with

508
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:25,610
a lot of uncertainty and those

509
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,399
uncertainty involve in perfect

510
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:33,350
monitoring and impediment to him because

511
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:36,290
what we cannot are we 100% monitor what

512
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,990
are the step that the attacker is taking

513
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,899
so the approach we take for that will be

514
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,800
partially observable game so we are

515
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,850
working on that

516
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:50,570
in computing formation we do not have

517
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:54,100
the full knowledge and having incomplete

518
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:57,678
information mean a Bayesian game

519
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:00,530
formulation we need also to learn what

520
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,900
is the attackers at a graph because in

521
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,899
the hekimae sales phase the attacker may

522
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,240
not discover the full topology or the

523
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,150
full attack graph so if it has only

524
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,059
partial knowledge how do we come to

525
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,760
learn the prior knowledge that the

526
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,830
attacker have his goal he cognition

527
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,620
already described the limited

528
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:26,360
rationality because in a complicated

529
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:29,689
Network we cannot assume 100% and all

530
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:33,590
the time full rationality so there are

531
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:36,260
model to deal with those limited

532
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:40,040
rationality and collision because it's

533
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:42,800
always easier to deceive a single player

534
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,770
compared to multiple player and at

535
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,919
everyone the mechanism to be distributed

536
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,830
based on local decision and locally

537
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,929
formation at h-naught level because the

538
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:57,100
network itself is a distributed network

539
00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:01,450
those are the challenge that we are

540
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:03,998
facing as of them my future research the

541
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:07,600
heck show that we are actively looking

542
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:10,840
into it and those are the real friends

543
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:28,059
that I mentioned before and this is a

544
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:46,418
good time for your question yes the mic

545
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:48,460
the mic to push the mic yes no it can

546
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,799
change the attack have the tie show is

547
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,330
just like an example you know I'm not

548
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,059
saying that that's the exact at a graph

549
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,490
of the scenario are presented it was

550
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,710
just to illustrate that you know it's

551
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,049
not only one part they can be multiple

552
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:05,529
parts and the attack have done half

553
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:08,470
technically any topology you know any

554
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,570
topology that we have can have depends

555
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,450
on the network that we are studying and

556
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,840
the topology may not even be fixed which

557
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:21,039
mobile network or mobile nodes you see

558
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,019
so node will be entering or exiting the

559
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,470
communication hands of the neighbor and

560
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:30,940
that will change you know the structure

561
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:35,080
of the attack half and this is also

562
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,980
another big challenge to deal with the

563
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,980
node mobility

564
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,089

other quiz Shaw okay there's no other

566
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,610
