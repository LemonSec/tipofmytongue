00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,760
good evening everyone today I am

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,020
extremely glad to her

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,140
with us he is a partner in ice

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,890
litigation group he concentrates his

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,540
practice on insurance coverage disputes

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,670
risk management and commercial

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,590
litigation Nick regularly advises

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,450
clients in insurance coverage matters

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,370
managing claims and advocating policy

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,040
construction that maximizes insurance

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,930
recovery as part of his risk management

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,960
practice Nick also assist clients with

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,700
data protection and privacy matters

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,980
today he will be talking about the role

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,290
of cyber insurance in security and risk

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,790
management thank you so as he mentioned

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,220
I'm an attorney and I'm in the

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,810
litigation group and you know I came up

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,070
as a litigator but I've always kind of

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,259
done insurance law and and when you

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,970
practice in insurance coverage law you

22
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,540
know there's two parts to it you're

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,460
you're handling claims after events

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,290
occur trying to help your clients get

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,199
recovery from their insurance policies

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,030
and they're also helping clients procure

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,459
it insurance and you know that process

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,369
it's it's easy to do the former because

29
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,750
every client wants to get recovery when

30
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,940
they have something that is have

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,740
something happen the former is a little

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,030
trickier because you're asking clients

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,970
to pay for something that they don't

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,539
know they need yet and in this space

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,830
data security privacy information

36
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,910
security has kind of been the exception

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,619
to the rule this is one place where

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,810
clients are really really interested in

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,569
talking about insurance it's kind of

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,369
become this buzzword and it's something

41
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,319
I spend a lot of time talking a lot

42
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,479
about a lot of time thinking about and

43
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,060
frankly a lot of times a lot of time

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,640
working with clients on and and I like

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,179
to think that I make insurance kind of

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,250
fun in that I'm kind of passionate about

47
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:09,660
it and so I love talking about this

48
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,000
stuff and so I'm going to kind of take

49
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,280
you through the world of cyber insurance

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,980
and how it fits into information

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,319
security and and and the risk analysis

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,000
process and really what it looks like

53
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,799
but I'd encourage you know if you have

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
any questions as we're talking about

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,760
this you know don't hesitate I know

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,560
everybody says that but I really mean it

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,000
you know if you see something you got a

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,070
question ask me because like I said

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
I love talking about this stuff and and

60
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,640
and I'm happy to kind of take questions

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,740
as we go as I mentioned a minute ago you

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,899
know it's kind of become this buzzword

63
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,550
cyber insurance it is a big deal for a

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,250
couple of reasons both on the supply

65
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,620
side and on the demand side it's become

66
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,650
this big deal because it's in the news a

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,810
lot you're reading about you know cyber

68
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,370
crime data breaches you know it's

69
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,709
unavoidable i'm sure you guys probably

70
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,080
get tired of hearing about it just as

71
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,750
much as everyone else does but that's

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,840
you know manifests itself in in

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,810
corporate boardrooms and presidents of

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,110
small businesses risk management folks

75
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,120
you know making this a priority and so

76
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,340
you know it's a question they're asked

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,650
constantly by their by their customers

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,709
by their vendors by their employees what

79
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,940
are we doing in this space on the flip

80
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,890
side in the end the kind of what I'll

81
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,350
call the supply side you have the

82
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,029
insurance industry and I I will tell you

83
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,459
that 20 years ago there was no such

84
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,549
thing as cyber insurance it dis just

85
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,580
didn't exist for the obvious reasons and

86
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,650
it kind of had this slow growth it kind

87
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,120
of started to exist and then you know

88
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,160
all of a sudden there was just this

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,070
explosion in the last five to seven

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,630
years she went from a space a market

91
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,180
that didn't exist for insurance

92
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,459
companies to it's going to be few

93
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,040
billion dollars of premiums and in the

94
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,110
next couple of years and so there's been

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,540
kind of this arms race everyone wants

96
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,260
their piece of the pie it's been a long

97
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,810
time since a new category of insurance

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,100
has just appeared out of the aether I

99
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,660
mean you've got you know your

100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,030
traditional lines of insurance that all

101
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,769
you guys have heard of 30 40 years ago

102
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,779
the idea of what was called directors

103
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,310
and officers insurance came up and that

104
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,380
was a big thing and everyone raced to

105
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:28,410
the market and since then this has been

106
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:30,479
the first new big thing you know why is

107
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,130
it a big thing I mean like I said it's

108
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,719
the supply the demand but it's also the

109
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,580
reality and it's kind of what I'm

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,320
showing in this slide here you know I

111
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,240
know it was told this is kind of a

112
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,770
diverse group you know some are you in

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,380
computer science some of you aren't are

114
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,609
not some of you are interested in for me

115
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,940
patient security some of you are just

116
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,200
doing this stuff for fun but the fact of

117
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,960
the matter is there's been this

118
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,719
realization that no matter what you do

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,000
you're still going to have you know with

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,530
this this comic strip calls Dave you're

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,270
going to have human air and there's

122
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:05,359
going to be you know this event you know

123
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,890
and for some businesses companies

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,020
they're going to have events and it's

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,460
going to be you know a hundred thousand

126
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,320
dollars some they're going to have

127
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,520
events and it's going to be a million

128
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,630
dollars and some they're going to have

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,090
events and a put them out of business

130
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,040
but then there's some that have gone

131
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,440
through this process and they've got the

132
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,480
right insurance in place and it will

133
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,940
just be an inconvenience but ultimately

134
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,730
there won't be a huge cost associated

135
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,850
with it and and so to kind of

136
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,560
distinguish you know kind of the the

137
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,960
stuff on the right you know firewalls

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,300
encryptions here and that is is risk

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,580
avoidance what insurance is its risk

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,830
transfer it's saying hey I'm going to do

141
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,260
my best but ultimately I want to

142
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,120
transfer this risk to somebody else and

143
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,460
the reality is that you don't no matter

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,100
how much risk avoidance you do there's

145
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,530
risk left on the table and so this is

146
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,370
the mechanism to transfer it and so it

147
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,559
is part of the information security the

148
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,720
data security conversation from the

149
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,480
small business to the fortune 500

150
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:11,100
company you know you don't have to take

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,930
my word for it really either I like to

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,300
put this up because this is this is SEC

153
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,270
guidance right the SEC doesn't have a

154
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,040
formal regulation with respect to what

155
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,650
I'll call cybersecurity and although I

156
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,660
know that word gets gets overused but

157
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,210
but they use it here so I'll use it here

158
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,460
as well and and the SEC is saying hey

159
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,739
when you're investing in a company we

160
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,260
think that that cybersecurity is now

161
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,330
important enough that companies need to

162
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,550
be telling investors this is what we're

163
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,080
doing about cybersecurity and you'll see

164
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,150
these different things hey we think they

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,669
should disclose a and B and C and D and

166
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,590
the last one on there is is is is the

167
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,020
description of relevant insurance

168
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,400
coverage so even the SEC who has no

169
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,010
stake in this game you know they're not

170
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,469
selling insurance they're saying hey if

171
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,420
you're evaluating the cybersecurity of

172
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,060
the company and we're going to list what

173
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,130
one two three four five things one of

174
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,890
those considerations one part of that

175
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,690
risk analysis is the insurance that

176
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,560
they're carrying so this is an

177
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:13,290
unavoidable part of kind of the total

178
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,710
you know security process the total risk

179
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,540
process and so I guess that begs the

180
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,719
question you know why should you care

181
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,790
and I think you know I don't have a

182
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,260
total sense of how many of you you know

183
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,450
are going to be an information security

184
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,270
as your career or going to be doing

185
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,810
computer science but but i'll tell you a

186
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,820
few things you know there is effective

187
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,680
insurance procurement and there's

188
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,659
ineffective insurance procurement and

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,970
and there's a lot more of the latter

190
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,010
than there is of the former this is

191
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,770
become a check the box exercise

192
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,620
businesses know i have to have this you

193
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,210
know you everyone wants to know do you

194
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,780
have your cyber insurance did you put a

195
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,190
policy in place and so you know they go

196
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,989
talk to broker they say hey I want a

197
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,940
policy they get a policy off the shelf

198
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,770
they pay the premium and they can say to

199
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,900
their board or their investors or their

200
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,330
partners I got it we've got cyber

201
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,099
insurance policy the reality is this is

202
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,599
I think a lot of you probably know

203
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,830
you're getting a handle on your own

204
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,990
network infrastructure your own sense

205
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,390
system infrastructure is incredibly

206
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,850
complicated and then you combine that

207
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,830
with the complexities that are inherent

208
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,500
in in an insurance policy and go read

209
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,740
your auto policy and and you know you'll

210
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,050
see how cryptic insurance policies are

211
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,240
written so you've got one person that

212
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,180
speaks the insurance language and then

213
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,460
you've got you know somebody you know HR

214
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,109
person a general counsel who doesn't

215
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,150
speak the technology language and

216
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,740
they're trying to come up and pick the

217
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,170
right policy and that doesn't work and

218
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,240
so it's people that understand the

219
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,589
technology you know if any of you are

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,910
working in IT is yeah that is somebody

221
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,460
that needs to be part of this

222
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,079
conversation and and so I think it's

223
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,850
important to understand the framework

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,310
understand what this market place looks

225
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,600
like understand what is covered in what

226
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,790
they're trying to achieve and what

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,890
they're not trying to achieve because it

228
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,199
puts you in that unique position to know

229
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,290
hey as a business when we're doing this

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,910
process

231
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,310
this is what we need to be looking for

232
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,410
in insurance policies this is what is

233
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,810
out there because a lot of times that's

234
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,759
the biggest problem is you know you only

235
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,219
have a lens into the insurance world

236
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,139
based on what your business is agent or

237
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,420
broker shares with you or is willing to

238
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,610
tell you and and so I think it's

239
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,479
important in this space to understand

240
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:37,120
you know what this market looks like the

241
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,769
other reason that I think you know folks

242
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,190
in the technology space need to care

243
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,620
about insurance is that piece of pie

244
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,279
that portion of risk it's being left on

245
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,670
the table you know it's it's increasing

246
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:54,910
in size to a certain extent you know for

247
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,170
all the news for all of the of the

248
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,910
attention that this topic gets

249
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,860
businesses are not seeing the collateral

250
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,750
damage that that you know you'd believe

251
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,130
you know there's a punim and institute

252
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,709
study that says when there's a data

253
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,800
breach it costs two hundred dollars per

254
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:14,170
person you know that's pretty much been

255
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,810
debunked and that the reality is that

256
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,310
breaches aren't that expensive and and

257
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,829
for most companies when they have an

258
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,560
event right now it's kind of a bit of

259
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,149
bleep and so it's hard to convince

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,579
businesses to make real investments

261
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,290
beyond a certain point beyond a certain

262
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,569
dollar figure in information security

263
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,939
they'd rather leave some of that risk on

264
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:36,490
the table and then transfer it through

265
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,910
insurance and the byproduct of that is

266
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,730
insurance companies increasingly have a

267
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,230
seat at the table in kind of this larger

268
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,610
discussion of what are the minimum

269
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,949
standards so in what does what what what

270
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,630
are the standard policy and practices

271
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,760
that should be out there and whether you

272
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,610
realize it or not you know insurance

273
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,170
companies are a big driver in in in

274
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,810
setting those standards because

275
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,610
ultimately it's their risk and so they

276
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,550
have they have probably the biggest

277
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,009
vested interest in seeing this through

278
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,529
so again it's I think it's helpful if

279
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:13,839
you're going to work in in that that

280
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:16,120
sector to understand you know what cyber

281
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:21,550
insurance is and kind of how how it

282
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,709
plays a role so anytime you have a

283
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,760
conversation about insurance I think

284
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,900
it's an important

285
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,790
to understand the difference between

286
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,040
first party insurance and third party

287
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,020
insurance and so the easiest example is

288
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,480
to think about your auto insurance the

289
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,340
first party insurance that you have that

290
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,920
is the comprehensive coverage on your

291
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,230
car right that is there was a hailstorm

292
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,900
or some kid was walking down the alley

293
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:48,400
and broke my mirror off I have something

294
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,530
I've incurred lost myself costs myself

295
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,079
and I would like the insurance company

296
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,939
to reimburse me that's first party

297
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,070
insurance so they say on your homeowners

298
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,500
policy it's the part that covers you

299
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,870
know hail damage to your roof third

300
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,000
party insurance it's the idea of

301
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,920
something happened it's my fault

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,800
something happened to somebody else and

303
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,110
that person's making a demand on me that

304
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,020
third party is making a demand of me and

305
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,850
I want the insurance company to pay that

306
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,230
person so that's the liability portion

307
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,030
of your auto policy right that's the guy

308
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,620
you rear-ended that's on your homeowners

309
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,439
policy it's a person that slips and

310
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,000
falls on the lawn and when we talk about

311
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,130
the different types of cyber insurance

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,900
in a minute you'll see they fall into

313
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,570
the same categories you know you'll have

314
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,020
stuff like like network interruptions

315
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,060
there or data restoration costs that

316
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,100
you're incurring yourself that's first

317
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,859
party stuff then you've got you know

318
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,450
events where data breach is a perfect

319
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,070
example you've got sure you got some

320
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,600
first party class but you have someone

321
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,360
suing you for losing their trade secrets

322
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,890
or suing you for losing their social

323
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,540
security number because I can promise

324
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,130
you after every data breach you read

325
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,750
about there are lawyers filing a

326
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,090
class-action suit whether it's winnable

327
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,010
or not and and so that's somebody else

328
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,340
so there's a third party and a

329
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,140
first-party component historically if

330
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,370
you were a business your first party

331
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,439
insurance was covered under something

332
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,240
called the cgl policy and it still is I

333
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,830
mean your third party insurance the cgl

334
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,680
policy commercial general liability

335
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,170
policy that's what covers you know

336
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,300
kroger if you fall inside the kroger or

337
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:23,260
it's covered to provides products

338
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,290
liability coverage for a while there

339
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,270
were some inroads on the cgl and folks

340
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,180
tried to put technology related

341
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:34,300
liabilities into the cgl policy because

342
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,790
it wasn't really written with you know

343
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,750
this stuff in mind there's a store

344
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,520
ganization called the iso and in

345
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,100
my world is o stands for insurance

346
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,840
services organization I realize you know

347
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,740
there's another ayah so that you guys

348
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,320
maybe deal with more often but the ISO

349
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,770
drafted the current version of the cgl

350
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,530
in the 60s and it gets tweaked every

351
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,569
four five six years but it's a word hear

352
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,550
a word there otherwise it's just this

353
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,320
same policy and so there were some

354
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,359
inroads we're insured started getting

355
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,550
coverage out of their cgl policy and

356
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,010
then eventually the insurer said enough

357
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,260
and in 2014 that was revised to make

358
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,180
abundantly clear that these kinds of

359
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,319
technology related losses that we're

360
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,329
going to talk about is being covered

361
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,430
under cyber policies they're out the

362
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,980
door same they're not they're not part

363
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,290
of the policy there's the unimpeachable

364
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,880
language now included in the cgl policy

365
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,140
same thing on the first party side it

366
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,420
was traditionally covered under what was

367
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,130
called a property policy of business

368
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,920
property policy commercial property

369
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,140
policy same thing standard form for a

370
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,699
while you know there was kind of these

371
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,400
tortured attempts to bring technology

372
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,900
events within the property policy but

373
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,000
the thing is it always required a

374
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,400
physical loss so there's kind of these

375
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,890
funny court opinions from the the late

376
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,199
90s where judges are trying to talk

377
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,210
about electrons moving to try and imply

378
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,580
that there's been some some physical

379
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,500
loss you know like a hurricane but but

380
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,240
it wasn't and so eventually same thing

381
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,300
they wrote it out of the property policy

382
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,860
and and and so you write it out you know

383
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,050
they say they were just trying to live

384
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,580
up to expectations but you know what do

385
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,990
you know they created this multi-billion

386
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,850
dollar market because once it was

387
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,160
written out and the answer was specialty

388
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,110
insurance and specialty insurance is

389
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,240
once you get away from those those

390
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,670
things you know you know your auto the

391
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,640
cgl the property this is this is for a

392
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,530
very specialized risk that other stuff

393
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,270
is written on kind of an all risk basis

394
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,209
it says we'll cover you for anything

395
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,220
that causes bodily injury well this is

396
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,370
specialty insurance it's written for a

397
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,020
very specific purpose and what happened

398
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,910
is that ayah so that organization that I

399
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,670
mentioned a minute ago they started out

400
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,699
they tried to draft their own kind of

401
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,390
cyber security policy and nobody liked

402
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,800
it it was it was a little too too basic

403
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,310
and you didn't have the 50 60 years of

404
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,319
expectations that have been

405
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,569
rated say like under a cgl policy

406
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,180
because one thing about using the same

407
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,640
policy for 50 or 60 years every word in

408
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,680
that policy has been defined by 10

409
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,750
different courts has been the subject of

410
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,430
disputes I mean you could tell me about

411
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,320
any kind of loss and I could tell you

412
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,729
without looking at a business's policy

413
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,250
whether it's going to be covered or not

414
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:16,070
because I know what a cgl policy looks

415
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,960
like here once the ISO policy got kind

416
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,360
of tossed out the door every insurer

417
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,570
started writing their own policy and so

418
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,029
you kind of had this huge smattering of

419
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,830
insurance policies if you go to a aiji's

420
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,570
website right now you go to their

421
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,120
technology page you'll see they're

422
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,380
offering four different policies that

423
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,260
it's hard to tell the difference even

424
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,550
between their own for policies and then

425
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,589
you take that across the entire

426
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,300
insurance market and add in the fact

427
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,730
that everyone's competing for this pie

428
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,939
this huge new pie and you just have

429
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,700
policy after policy being cranked out

430
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,160
you combine that with the difficulty in

431
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,250
technique and in terminology everyone

432
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,410
knows what a bodily injury is and you

433
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,040
know and we can define it and insurers

434
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,449
can define it but there's no uniform

435
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,119
terminology I mean there are in certain

436
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,910
instances but you know it's a much more

437
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,119
difficult to write in succinct languages

438
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,400
and describe the type of events that are

439
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,819
going to lead to technology related

440
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,679
losses to lead to cyber losses you know

441
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,750
and so what you end up with is the cyber

442
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,310
policies and the ensuring agreement that

443
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,140
the the part that says this is what

444
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,958
we're going to cover it'll be a sentence

445
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,750
and it'll just say we provide coverage

446
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,790
for loss arising from a security event

447
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,260
when security event will be in bold

448
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,780
which means it's defined elsewhere in

449
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,010
the policy so you turn 17 pages into the

450
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,139
policy you find the definition of

451
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,450
security event it'll be two sentences

452
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,830
but then it'll have nine bolded words in

453
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,480
it and so then you go find the

454
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,928
definition of those nine bolded words

455
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,130
and pretty soon it's it's it's like a

456
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:51,550
computer program I mean you're doing all

457
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,780
these substitutions and replacements to

458
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,870
figure out what that first sentence

459
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,020
meant and you know you try and do that

460
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,330
across 12 14 20 policies it starts to

461
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,400
get really hard to compare this stuff so

462
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,679
you end up with kind of this this wild

463
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,540
wild west

464
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,870
and that goes back to that point I

465
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,970
raised at the beginning of you know

466
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,129
people in that are there are computer

467
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,570
programs their information security they

468
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,330
have to be part of this conversation

469
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,179
once you're in the private sector your

470
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,040
university wherever because you're the

471
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,290
ones that can say all right what they're

472
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,960
describing their as a security event

473
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,850
once we take it down to the nubs and see

474
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,610
what they're talking about that's not

475
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,439
our risk our risk is this and that's

476
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,969
described in that third policy you

477
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,170
showed me not the first one not the

478
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,700
second one so there's kind of this

479
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,760
there's both opportunity and risk

480
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,200
because of this this smattering of

481
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,670
policies the risk is you're going to buy

482
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,960
a policy and is not going to cover any

483
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,360
of the risks that your organization

484
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,760
actually has on the flip side there's

485
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,080
this opportunity where if you know your

486
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,420
risks and know how to read these

487
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,250
policies and you take the time to read

488
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,380
them and analyze them a lot of times you

489
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,580
can get coverage for risks that the

490
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,470
insurance company isn't really even

491
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,300
charging a premium for because there's

492
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,590
this this asymmetry of information and

493
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,360
we'll talk about that in a minute as

494
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,000
being one of the underwriting problems

495
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,490
you know you know your system it's

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,920
really hard for an insurance company to

497
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,840
come in and wrap their heads around your

498
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,130
infrastructure I mean they can do it but

499
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,600
are they going to put the man hours in a

500
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,600
certain point it's not worth the premium

501
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,570
dollars for them to come in and sit next

502
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,490
to your your C so and and say show me

503
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,110
this now show me that and so there's

504
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,820
this information asymmetry that can be

505
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,120
good it can be bad but it's something

506
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,560
that if the people in this room for

507
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,979
instance are involved the process it's

508
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,050
an advantage actually two organizations

509
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,090
so this little chart here I use this as

510
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,600
kind of the layout of what the market

511
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,100
place looks like here and you know I I

512
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,899
want to kind of talk through these

513
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,199
different categories you get an idea of

514
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,780
what's being covered in and how it's

515
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,790
being covered and again you know like i

516
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,410
said this isn't uniform so i like to

517
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,570
make them spin just to kind of

518
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,770
illustrate the point that every policy

519
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,659
is going to be organized this way

520
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,760
sometimes you have to buy a first-party

521
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,560
policy in a third party policy sometimes

522
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,030
it's one policy combining all of these

523
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,370
coverages sometimes this is eight

524
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,860
different policies you know a couple

525
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,489
slides ago that little check box there

526
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,678
that's from

527
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,750
an actual insurance application and they

528
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,179
want you to check those boxes and then

529
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,679
the policies like 600 pages long and you

530
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,080
have to go back to that first page and

531
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,120
you have to go and match up the coverage

532
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,800
parts with the boxes that are checked so

533
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,080
it's you know it's kind of this Chinese

534
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,850
food menu approach and and so you know

535
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,280
but still when you get down to the core

536
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,090
they're all selling versions of the same

537
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,070
basic coverages so third-party coverages

538
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,840
you know you kind of see tech Eno

539
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,730
network security and data breach and

540
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,199
data breach I kind of have straddling

541
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,780
the tomb we'll talk about that in just a

542
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,720
second there's overlap here when we talk

543
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,990
about technology Eno and I won't belabor

544
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,880
you know any of these too long because

545
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,110
that can get a little boring but

546
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,120
technology you know the you know as

547
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,240
errors and omissions so technology you

548
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,340
know that is the your techno techno

549
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,550
technological products your

550
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,590
technological services so if you're in

551
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,139
the business of writing software and

552
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,899
your software malfunctions and it causes

553
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,320
a customer or your customers customer a

554
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,360
loss that's technology Eno you made an

555
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,909
errand omission in the actual services

556
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,309
you were providing as a provider of

557
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,380
technology services that caused a loss

558
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:39,410
to a third party because again this is a

559
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,410
third-party coverage and and so you know

560
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,910
yeah it's obvious that you know somebody

561
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,160
that actually provides hardware and

562
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,080
software is going to have this but you

563
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,559
know increasingly every business has

564
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,120
some technology facing portion of their

565
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,639
business whether it's something as

566
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,010
simple as a website or an app so

567
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,190
everybody carries or should carry some

568
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,840
form of Technology you know for that

569
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,010
portion of their business because I can

570
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,629
tell you that's not going to be covered

571
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,420
under their other errors and omissions

572
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,040
or liability type insurance on the other

573
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,440
side will skip network security for a

574
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,540
minute you've got data breach and so

575
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,309
again this is there's been some breach

576
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,440
you've lost socials you lost medical

577
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,660
records you've lost trade secrets

578
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,580
sometimes it's it's it's even more

579
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,130
innocuous it's not something that is

580
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,750
independently confidential but you have

581
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,580
an agreement with a customer that you're

582
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,419
going to hold their information

583
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,668
confidential it can be you know just

584
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,369
customer

585
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:37,499
it can be you know sales data stuff that

586
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,539
has a a value in the economic

587
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:41,820
marketplace but wouldn't be considered

588
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:44,749
traditionally confidential you know it's

589
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,749
not a social yeah go ahead

590
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,389
insurance policy but then separately how

591
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,919
does that work with SEC filings because

592
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,919
you know if you're saying I have damages

593
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,380
because I'm getting sued you have to

594
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,559
also then file if your home accompanied

595
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,140
saying you know we've lost this much you

596
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,000
get into two companies get in your

597
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,330
position sorry you know there's always

598
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,950
attention when these on only because you

599
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,360
know you have to make a determination as

600
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,149
to whether ongoing litigation is

601
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,199
material and but here when you're

602
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,330
talking about a data breach there's

603
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,549
actually two cost components you have

604
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,289
the potentiality of a class action

605
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,179
lawsuit which is an actual piece of

606
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,549
litigation and that you're doing this

607
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:51,380
materiality test is this because company

608
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,450
like Sony is being sued at any given

609
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,460
time you know in in multiple iterations

610
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,140
in multiple places so they're always

611
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,149
disclosing hey you know as part of our

612
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,970
business we have litigation that's

613
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:03,080
ongoing if something is going to be huge

614
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,730
something that is going to make a

615
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,760
material impact on their balance sheets

616
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,740
they're going to disclose that the other

617
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,510
cost component that may end up in

618
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,860
something like an SEC filing and

619
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,049
certainly is going to show up in their

620
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,330
company's books is when you have the

621
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:19,070
internal costs for the data breach and

622
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,840
as I said it kind of straddles because

623
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,090
the Third Point costs the person suing

624
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,570
you the first party costs are things

625
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:29,029
like you know the actual cost of

626
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,039
maintaining a call center the cost of

627
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,899
providing all that credit monitoring the

628
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,279
reputational harm believe it or not you

629
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:37,668
can get coverage for reputation I'm

630
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:40,340
hiring PR folks you know complying with

631
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:42,350
regulatory investigations because you

632
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,149
know you're going to have depending on

633
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,980
what kind of entity are you have the FTC

634
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,779
or States Attorney General coming after

635
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,309
you and asking questions so you really

636
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,610
have two different costs to whether it

637
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,980
ends up in an SEC filing yeah that stuff

638
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,439
happens you know it really depends on

639
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,179
how material it is you know you can get

640
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,460
into more complex issues when you're

641
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,380
talking about you know criminal activity

642
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,539
and there's a criminal investigation you

643
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,309
know sometimes even even notifying

644
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,470
customers can be delayed if law

645
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,520
enforcement says look

646
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,950
want you to tell anyone that this is

647
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,809
happening because this this is there's

648
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,520
an ongoing investigation so there's some

649
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:19,629
safe harbors there but it's definitely

650
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,059
something something that can show up you

651
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,980
know and and on the issue of the class

652
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:25,270
action you know what's interesting there

653
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,190
is there's kind of been this changing

654
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,418
landscape at first there was this idea

655
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,760
hey if I lose your social security

656
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,650
number have you really been harmed I

657
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,650
gave you credit monitoring you know what

658
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,230
what he what are your damages and and

659
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,159
courts at first kind of made this

660
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:44,380
analogy to the medical device and and in

661
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,909
pharmaceutical industry law which which

662
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,740
had said for a long time at least in

663
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:49,179
this part of the country that if the

664
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,730
only thing you took a drug and you had

665
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:53,980
no manifesting you know symptoms or

666
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,720
these side effects just kind of being

667
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,610
more aware that you should keep an eye

668
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,409
out for more you really damaged and the

669
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,110
answer was no and so there was kind of

670
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:03,520
this analogy like hey worrying that

671
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,039
you're that your identity might be

672
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,049
stolen that's not a damaged and so

673
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,460
there's no class there's no class action

674
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:11,650
that's a road in the last couple of

675
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,780
years and some lawyers have made some

676
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,809
inroads saying you know what it's just

677
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,030
it's confidential information and it

678
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:21,100
causes people emotional distress to know

679
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,178
that they've been compromised and so

680
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,189
we're going to let some of these class

681
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,600
actions move forward and so I think

682
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,370
we're going to see more and more

683
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,678
companies evaluating those and saying

684
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,510
this is a material event we do have real

685
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
skin in the game this class action can

686
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,120
be very expensive to defend or

687
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,158
ultimately settler or pay a judgment on

688
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,500
the kind of middle one there is is

689
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,010
network security and this kind of it

690
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,260
fits in between because it's it's it's

691
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:50,280
when you have I'll use the term security

692
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,809
event when you have a security event or

693
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,299
but it's not a data breach you didn't

694
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:57,549
lose something nor was it the technology

695
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,500
facing part of your business but there's

696
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:02,080
been some network event some security

697
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,010
event that causes loss to a customer a

698
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,809
vendor you know or sometimes even just a

699
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:10,179
totally anonymous third party this is

700
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,830
folks get sued because they had weak

701
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,570
network security and their system was

702
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,110
used as part of launching a DDoS attack

703
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,059
or folks get sued because you know they

704
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,659
were the part of a compromise that end

705
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,040
up pushing malicious code

706
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,480
other computers are a bunch of their

707
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,250
customers a bunch of their vendors it

708
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,300
wasn't the technology services they were

709
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,610
providing was just part of their

710
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,010
infrastructure but it was a security

711
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,250
event that caused losses to these third

712
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,260
parties and the reality of the idea is

713
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,320
hey you were negligent it was your fault

714
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,660
that my system went down or or I had to

715
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,909
you know spend all this company all this

716
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,740
money on data restoration you know so

717
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,550
that's this idea of network security and

718
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,080
so it kind of fits in between the other

719
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,139
side is the first party coverages and

720
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,480
and we talked about the data breach one

721
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,460
second ago but I like to highlight it

722
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,830
because it's the one that that people

723
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,200
talk about the most we're finding

724
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,330
increasingly it doesn't need to be the

725
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,580
biggest concern because the idea of a

726
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,040
data breach has kind of been

727
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,780
commoditized the response process

728
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,720
everyone has gotten so many data breach

729
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:19,050
notices that the response rate that we

730
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,640
see on on credit monitoring is down to

731
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,800
like five percent you offer somebody

732
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,810
creep free credit monitoring now they've

733
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,940
already got it from so many other places

734
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,100
that they don't even take you up on the

735
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,580
offer anymore so those those costs are

736
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,889
going down you know same thing there's

737
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,270
companies that now all they do is run

738
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,490
call centers they answer questions about

739
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,110
data breaches send out the letters and

740
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,330
so it's been commoditized where it's

741
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,399
getting pretty cheap per person but it's

742
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,040
still something that you did you hear

743
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,860
about a lot and and so you know I put

744
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,110
this up here you know just because this

745
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,850
is the question that I get the most from

746
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,370
clients about their cyber technology

747
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,199
bird liability insurance is what do I

748
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,939
care about on the data breach side and

749
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,860
you'll see these are the things that I'm

750
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,390
that I'm always looking for here you

751
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,699
know one thing that I think you guys

752
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,080
could probably appreciate you know the

753
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,140
second one on their forensic

754
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,480
investigations cost we from that is the

755
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,310
most expensive component of this it's

756
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,470
more expensive than the lawyers it's

757
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,639
more expensive than the actual

758
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,580
notification sometimes you got a breach

759
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,800
and it's going to end up that it was 14

760
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,470
medical records involved but you've paid

761
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,570
somebody a lot of money to figure out

762
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,670
that it was only 14 medical records and

763
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,730
you know that can get into six figures

764
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,170
before you know it and so I that's kind

765
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,070
of priority number one when you're

766
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,539
talking about

767
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,830
for each response it's not the cost to

768
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,139
send out the letters it's not the cost

769
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,840
of lawyers it's the cost to bring in

770
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:45,418
good forensics people that can that can

771
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,908
make this determination was there even

772
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:51,419
really a breach and in how big or how

773
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:52,529
small was it nobody likes to despite

774
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,409
what I'm telling you about the cost

775
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,860
nobody likes to over notice and and so

776
00:29:55,409 --> 00:30:01,769
nobody wants to send something to 6,000

777
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,729
patients if there's only 15 affected PF

778
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:07,440
changs they raced out of the gate they

779
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,659
had a breach of their payment system

780
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,860
they raced out of the gate and they over

781
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:15,450
notified and then it turned out that it

782
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,250
the breach was only about a quarter of

783
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,840
the size that they thought well what

784
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,610
ended up happening well MasterCard and

785
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,899
Visa and the issuing banks they had to

786
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,600
replace all those cards well they said

787
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:26,219
the PF changs we want 50 bucks for every

788
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,469
one of those cards we had to replace and

789
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,110
they didn't replace 60,000 instead of

790
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,850
15,000 so there is this priority of

791
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,309
let's do this right the first time

792
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,928
that's an extreme example but when you

793
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:38,428
start to talk about smaller businesses

794
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,429
just the reputational effect of having

795
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,899
to notify you know 600 customers your

796
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:44,850
small mortgage broker you know what

797
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,979
every customer you ever originated a

798
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,259
mortgage for to know that you know you

799
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,149
had this event and so there's this

800
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,340
there's this idea hey if I've got

801
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:56,100
coverage and I can bring in somebody and

802
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,899
pay them money to figure out what the

803
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,309
real scope of this was because you can

804
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,989
always default to tell everybody that's

805
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,779
ever been in your system but you want

806
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,909
you want the right answer there a couple

807
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,289
other ones that are interesting their

808
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:09,179
data in the in the hands of third

809
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:11,429
parties insurance companies have gotten

810
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,600
better at this it was a time where this

811
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:17,159
was almost had reached a crisis level

812
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,360
because there was so much cloud

813
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:23,220
computing and the continues to be and

814
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,189
the carriers were still defining

815
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,539
computer networks and data stored on

816
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,860
computer networks and that was defined

817
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,169
I'm kind of the stuff in your own

818
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,519
building and that wasn't workable and

819
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,990
they've gotten better at that but it's

820
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,120
it's one of these things you have to

821
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,789
look for in these policies because a lot

822
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,309
of stuff isn't stored in on your own

823
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:43,740
system and and you know ultimately

824
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:45,570
you're legally responsible when you have

825
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,909
a breach that affected data you took in

826
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,870
and so even if it was somebody else's

827
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:51,480
fault it was some

828
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,040
cloud providers some third party and and

829
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,990
there's been this event because they had

830
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,970
an issue you're still responsible so you

831
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,520
want to make sure this coverage extends

832
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,230
that far uh the other one I like to

833
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,850
point out is exclusions and retroactive

834
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,220
dates because this is where the the real

835
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,480
meat is you get into these exclusions in

836
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,890
the back of an insurance policy read

837
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,780
them in your auto or your home owner and

838
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,100
you'll see it's a pretty long list and

839
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,430
these cyber policies are go on for pages

840
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,590
and and and and on the data breach this

841
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:20,309
is one from a policy that that a client

842
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:22,020
showed me a few months ago and it keep

843
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:24,629
in mind this is a data breach policy and

844
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,240
you read the things it says regardless

845
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,340
of other events or cause of contributing

846
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,380
concurrently so if any one of these

847
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,970
things was true they weren't going to

848
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,160
provide you with coverage for your data

849
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,440
breach you look at that though that

850
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,080
stuff it's all ambiguous broad language

851
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,880
it would be hard to come up with a data

852
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,949
breach scenario that wouldn't fall

853
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,380
within one of these exclusions and so

854
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,360
again it's this critical reading of you

855
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,520
know let's not make let's not by Alou

856
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,110
surrey insurance coverage and if you

857
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,030
went and talked the agent that that's

858
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,770
selling this on behalf of I won't tell

859
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,420
what say what I'm sure it is you know

860
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,980
it's oh they don't mean it like that

861
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,350
they're just trying to take some things

862
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,490
off the edges but that's fine to say

863
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,199
that up front but good luck when you

864
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,880
have a claim because the way insurance

865
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,559
works there's underwriting and there's

866
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,940
claims and the people that are writing

867
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,200
and selling the policies are not the

868
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,240
same people that are reading them when

869
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,130
it come times come when it comes time to

870
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,020
actually submit your claim and try and

871
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:19,500
get paid and so again it's just it's

872
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,850
illustrative of kind of the problems in

873
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,860
the in in in terminology I mean you you

874
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,149
saw an insurance policy like this you

875
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,330
would want to run as far away as you

876
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:52,429
could yeah

877
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:54,230
I was just saying that several popular

878
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:56,779
anti viruses they have known

879
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,240
vulnerabilities so if I use those anti

880
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:02,330
viruses in my company infrastructure and

881
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,809
then data is lost and my business is

882
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:09,199
stopped item number 5 says defects of

883
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:12,469
software supplied by a third party look

884
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,189
no coverage and antivirus manufacturer

885
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:19,040
will tell me he read the license it says

886
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,349
like we don't reimburse any damage or

887
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,230
maximum amount to be reimbursed is like

888
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:25,669
a lot $10,000 lot of times are the price

889
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,849
of the product because it will give you

890
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:30,379
one 999 back oh but yeah no I mean like

891
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,179
I said it's hard to come up with if

892
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,399
there hasn't been a defect in some

893
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,230
third-party piece of software or there

894
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,000
wasn't some you weren't using some

895
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:41,089
obsolete you know hardware or software

896
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,469
or you didn't fail to ensure that your

897
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,149
computer system has protected the

898
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:47,569
industry standards whatever that means

899
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:48,980
you know it's not even a defined term if

900
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,210
that none of those were true you

901
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,589
wouldn't have the data breach in the

902
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,500
first place unless you were literally

903
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,599
doing it on purpose and so you know it's

904
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,599
just again it's it's terrible language

905
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,849
but it's a it's it's exhibit number one

906
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,980
as to why you have to read these kind of

907
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:07,880
things and the people that understand

908
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,500
what what the risks are have to read

909
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,050
these things with the folks that are

910
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,460
actually procuring them the first part

911
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:17,349
of coverage is the other the other big

912
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:20,359
category is computer crime and you know

913
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:22,310
we have seen that this has become a

914
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:23,839
bigger deal this is where our clients

915
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,540
are underinsured and this is where they

916
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,359
have huge losses on this on this this

917
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:31,869
first party computer crime stuff and i

918
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,700
think that the ideas there are pretty

919
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:37,250
pretty self-explanatory data restoration

920
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,899
network out interruption and extortion

921
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,990
and there's coverages that are available

922
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,760
just for kind of negligent in verton to

923
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,109
vent and there are coverages that are

924
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,059
available for malicious events were some

925
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:49,980
you know intentionally attacking your

926
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:53,130
network and and interrupting your

927
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,390
business but those are two you know data

928
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,400
restoration Network interruption

929
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,578
depending on the scale and the size your

930
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,890
business can be incredibly complicated

931
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:04,049
incredibly expensive and it's sometimes

932
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,118
very difficult to compensate me you

933
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,670
don't know what you've lost by being

934
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,900
down for three days you don't know what

935
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,519
kind of customers were coming through

936
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,079
and you know you get this business

937
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,089
interruption insurance that's supposed

938
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,920
to compensate that for that but even

939
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:20,940
that sometimes can be insufficient

940
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,420
extortion is a really really interesting

941
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,940
one so we have had this happened to

942
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,809
clients with increasing regularity over

943
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,630
the last nine months and talking to the

944
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:35,369
FBI and in talking to our clients and

945
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,440
the security consultants that we deal

946
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,150
with in the forensics folks it seems

947
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,579
like what's happened is there's become

948
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,549
this efficient market on the dark web

949
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,529
right and so it used to be that when you

950
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:48,390
had an intrusion and people would go

951
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:50,519
after socials they go after financial

952
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,900
records because they had a value and

953
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,359
they knew they could just go sell them

954
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,220
and kind of flip them over well those

955
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,410
values have plummeted because there's so

956
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,058
many socials available there's so many

957
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,129
credit card numbers available for sale

958
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,420
so now what kind of happens is is what

959
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,309
i'll call the interloper he gets into

960
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,200
your system he just takes whatever he

961
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,849
can find because he doesn't know what

962
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,710
it's worth but like i said there's this

963
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:13,109
efficient market on the dark web where

964
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,279
he comes back and he says hey I got

965
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:19,710
these files from a company that

966
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:21,539
manufactures widgets anybody interested

967
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,710
and then people come and it gives them a

968
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,210
little preview and they say you know

969
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,160
what I can do something with that I'll

970
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,589
give you X dollars so he didn't go in

971
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,328
saying this is valuable he took what he

972
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:33,180
could and he puts it on the market and

973
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:35,069
and that's caused big headaches for

974
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,470
folks because all of a sudden you know

975
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:39,180
you've got schematics that are lost like

976
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,488
I said you've got customer lists and and

977
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,739
these folks show up and they and you get

978
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:46,140
an email from you know one of these dark

979
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:48,390
web email servers that says I'm going to

980
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,460
send your customer lists to your biggest

981
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,019
competitor if you don't give me and

982
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,299
they're smart they don't ask me that's

983
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:57,508
not dr. evil they don't ask four billion

984
00:37:54,299 --> 00:38:00,059
dollars they say I want you know 30

985
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:02,789
Bitcoin and so it's a small enough no

986
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,619
her that the business could pay it but

987
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,119
you know or at least there's a

988
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,039
conversation about should we just pay it

989
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,719
but do you trust this guy you know in

990
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,359
conversations with the FBI they'll never

991
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,529
tell you do it or don't do it but you

992
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,930
know if you get them in a weak moment

993
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:17,130
they'll say you know frankly most of

994
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,348
these guys are pretty honorable about

995
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,819
this you pay the money in it and it goes

996
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:22,979
away so it's just a really fascinating

997
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:24,989
area what should the insurance cover

998
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:26,968
should have cover the ransom payment or

999
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:28,650
should it cover the cost to to do the

1000
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:30,299
restoration back to your last restore

1001
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,180
point and try and figure out you know

1002
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:34,859
what's missing it's it's it's it's it's

1003
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,049
a fascinating area and the insurers are

1004
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:39,538
trying to figure out how to cover it as

1005
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:41,579
well especially because it lends itself

1006
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:43,319
to insurance fraud because you've got

1007
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,059
insiders that if they know this coverage

1008
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:46,769
exists and they know that that the

1009
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:48,839
insurer will pay the ransom when

1010
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:53,788
requested then you've got the issue of

1011
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:55,558
kind of insider extortion you know I say

1012
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:58,829
that they're kind of honorable in fact

1013
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:01,920
we had one situation where a client paid

1014
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:04,339
and and then they were kind of put on a

1015
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,469
reference list they got contacted by

1016
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,599
somebody else that said hey we're going

1017
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,489
through this event he said he gave me

1018
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,949
your name and said you'd vouch for the

1019
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:17,309
fact that if I pay the ransom that

1020
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:19,019
nothing bad will happen so you know who

1021
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:22,709
knows who knows you no honor among

1022
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:24,328
thieves I guess you know what I always

1023
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:26,069
like to say about this too is when we're

1024
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,559
talking about these kind of things think

1025
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:30,390
in terms of loss not cause and because

1026
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,459
the losses are obvious you know it's

1027
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,769
it's it's easy to define the loss you

1028
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:37,799
want to cover it it's I want to be

1029
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:40,229
reimbursed for the cost of having to you

1030
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:43,229
know remanufactured this data or the

1031
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:46,169
cost of having to you know re-engineer

1032
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:48,499
my system what's really hard to

1033
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,239
articulate is the cause the cause

1034
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:53,069
changes so quickly that the insurance

1035
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,929
policies can't keep up with them and

1036
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,519
there are policies that speak in terms

1037
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:58,589
of loss and there are policies that

1038
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,098
speak in terms of cause and sometimes

1039
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:04,288
folks get greater kind of a sense of

1040
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,609
peace from the cause based policies they

1041
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,039
say that well this is what I was worried

1042
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:11,160
about this happening this this type of

1043
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,479
intrusion but but but it's the next

1044
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,390
intrusion is the one you don't know

1045
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:15,970
about and

1046
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,370
that really you know ends up being you

1047
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,200
know the risk the business event and so

1048
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,640
instead you want ones that talk in terms

1049
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,390
of loss they say we're going to cover

1050
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,859
these costs in the event that you incur

1051
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,230
them and then there'll be things like

1052
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,820
unless it's intentional you know kind of

1053
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,890
stuff that would would would keep you

1054
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,220
from you know using this to just buy

1055
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,020
yourself a new a new system but but but

1056
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,620
that that's the key in these first party

1057
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,330
coverages you know loss not cause last

1058
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,089
one we'll talk about just because it's

1059
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,340
probably the most common right now you

1060
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,200
don't probably don't see it as much as

1061
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,500
the data breach stuff mostly because

1062
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,450
companies don't like to talk about it

1063
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,670
but we're seeing tons and tons of funds

1064
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,140
transfer fraud this is just for and

1065
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,720
wires going out of corporate bank

1066
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,020
accounts day after day big companies

1067
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,759
small companies as little as five grand

1068
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,450
we've had we've had seven figure ones

1069
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,910
and and this is an example I like to use

1070
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,649
this also as an example because it's

1071
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,509
another place where understanding the

1072
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,030
risks and kind of keeping abreast as to

1073
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,310
what the newest and best is and you know

1074
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,500
what the bad guys are doing can help you

1075
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,870
get a better insurance policy so this is

1076
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,850
what the standard kind of Computer Fraud

1077
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,400
and funds transfer fraud language looks

1078
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,200
like and and I if you look at number two

1079
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,060
there there's something in quotes that

1080
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,609
says fraudulent instruction and the idea

1081
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,529
is if a bank receives a quote fraudulent

1082
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,030
instruction that causes money to go out

1083
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,680
of your account because that's the way

1084
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,600
it used to be it used to be people would

1085
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,799
you know you'd have a bank account where

1086
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,680
you could initiate a wire with

1087
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,290
letterhead or a fake signature or maybe

1088
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,759
just a simple set of credentials and and

1089
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,460
those were compromised and they were

1090
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,470
able to pretend to be you and give a

1091
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,200
fraudulent structure that's pretty rare

1092
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:01,950
now because just the kind of layered

1093
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,509
security programs the banks have and and

1094
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:07,270
multi-factor authentication it's really

1095
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,100
difficult and banks are really dubious

1096
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:12,310
especially once amounts get above say

1097
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,390
ten grand about wire transfers going out

1098
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,790
there they're very careful

1099
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:18,190
authenticating the user so what the new

1100
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,960
game is in funds transfer fraud is its

1101
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:23,410
kind of this business email compromise

1102
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,590
they get into your your email system and

1103
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,160
they end up weeding months and months of

1104
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,040
emails

1105
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,149
until they can craft really really

1106
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,340
convincing an effective impersonation of

1107
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,770
people that are all that that that have

1108
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,540
the authority to say to the CFO to say

1109
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,220
to somebody in finance I need you to

1110
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,480
initiate a wire transfer because they

1111
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,919
can look and they can see what you're

1112
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,370
with your practice and procedures they

1113
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:51,670
can see that Susie in in accounting gets

1114
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:53,620
instructions from Jane the CFO to wire

1115
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,320
money and they can mimic it perfectly

1116
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:59,890
and so there it's no longer fraudulent

1117
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,170
struction because Susie in finance she

1118
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,270
was authorized to make it and she was

1119
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,670
Susie when she did it it's just that she

1120
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,650
was tricked into doing it and so but

1121
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,970
that's not covered by this so so what

1122
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,590
there are is there there's kind of these

1123
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,359
gap fillers they're called endorsements

1124
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,440
and so now this is a perfect example if

1125
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,330
you know the risk you say to your

1126
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,890
insurance committee that's not really

1127
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,600
the type of funds transfer fraud I'm

1128
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,950
worried about so this one for instance I

1129
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,660
think this is from chubb which is a

1130
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,850
insurance company out of California and

1131
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,770
this one is you know they call this

1132
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:30,850
their social engineering endorsement and

1133
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,170
it adds this idea of hey what about when

1134
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,360
it's of it it's an authentic

1135
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,760
construction but it's just been induced

1136
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,710
by by some kind of social engineering

1137
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,150
like these business email compromise

1138
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,640
like I said you don't hear about them a

1139
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,680
lot they're embarrassing so companies

1140
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,670
don't like to talk about them and you

1141
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,799
know of most companies you know you're

1142
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,750
not going to be able to stale 20 million

1143
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,000
dollars because as you get to higher

1144
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,650
numbers that the protocols get get

1145
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,700
higher on and the bank side you know

1146
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,580
they want to talk to somebody on the

1147
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,230
phone that kind of thing but for small

1148
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,330
businesses you know they're they're

1149
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,250
really material and for big businesses

1150
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,569
it might be in seven figures but it's

1151
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,370
not something they're going to publicize

1152
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,800
because frankly it's embarrassing it

1153
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:17,890
looks like they lack their own

1154
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,180
institutional controls so you know now

1155
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,000
that we kind of have that framework

1156
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,089
there and I know I'm running out of time

1157
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,960
here so I'll speed up a little bit and

1158
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,090
just kind of talk through these

1159
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,620
underwriting problems because I think

1160
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,340
this is kind of the bigger picture right

1161
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,290
this is what you know what's the future

1162
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,790
of this market look like there's an

1163
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,380
underwriting problem in that the supply

1164
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,930
side of insurance our insurer to a

1165
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,650
risk-averse they don't want

1166
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,509
too they don't want to find out that

1167
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,670
something you jammed into one of the

1168
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:51,460
coverage that they weren't anticipating

1169
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,410
so they want to know what they're

1170
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,700
covering if they don't know what they're

1171
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,980
covering if they feel like they have

1172
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,740
gaps their solution is to raise premiums

1173
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,420
on the other side you've got the demand

1174
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,770
side which although it's ultimately

1175
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,319
organizations and businesses it goes

1176
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,480
through agents and brokers and the an

1177
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:09,520
agent and broker is also risk averse

1178
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,619
because you know who gets blamed when a

1179
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,300
company has an event and it turns out

1180
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:15,520
there's no insurance for it they go back

1181
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,200
to their agent and they say why didn't

1182
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,270
you tell me I needed that so you've got

1183
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,618
agents who want clients to buy

1184
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,150
everything because it's the only way to

1185
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,130
keep them safe and then you've got

1186
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,809
insurance companies that are jacking up

1187
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,880
premiums because they're so worried they

1188
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,290
don't have actuarial data they don't

1189
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,760
know what the next risk is going to look

1190
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,109
like and what it's going to cost and so

1191
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,260
you've got these skyrocketing premiums

1192
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:37,450
in lowering limits and so there's kind

1193
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,829
of this crisis where everyone knows they

1194
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,750
have to have it but it's becoming

1195
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,339
increasingly expensive to procure and

1196
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,069
it's becoming increasingly difficult to

1197
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:47,230
procure the limits that you need to kind

1198
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:50,049
of be in an effective risk mitigator for

1199
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:51,640
your business part of that I mentioned a

1200
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:55,660
minute ago is this idea of information

1201
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,058
asymmetry you know there is no actuarial

1202
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,730
data at you insurance company tell you

1203
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:02,500
with incredible certainty how likely it

1204
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,720
is that your warehouse is going to burn

1205
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,880
down in the next ten years they they

1206
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,589
study this stuff the actuarial tables

1207
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,210
are incredible they're very good at

1208
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:12,250
doing it and they price their policies

1209
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,410
that way they just don't have the

1210
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:17,619
actuarial data here they just don't know

1211
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:20,440
how to rate you it's again it's easy to

1212
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:23,140
say a pizza parlors more likely to burn

1213
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,630
down than you know some other type of

1214
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,520
business or a rubber factory is going to

1215
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,440
catch fire but you know somebody that

1216
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,990
think of something that isn't flammable

1217
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,339
is isn't and they are able to rate folks

1218
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,319
and say this is their risk and and

1219
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:36,730
they're very good at it how do you rate

1220
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:38,859
people in this I mean are you going to

1221
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,470
go in and are you gonna you know audit

1222
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:43,420
them are you going to just ask a bunch

1223
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,189
of questions on an application how good

1224
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,140
of a picture is that going to be you

1225
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,640
know you'll find that everybody every

1226
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,430
company we've ever dealt with tells us

1227
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,109
they have the best IT guy and the best

1228
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,279
information security guy there is

1229
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:54,880
because they don't know any better

1230
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,680
because

1231
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,329
the person telling them that is the guy

1232
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,308
who with you're holding out is the best

1233
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:01,869
so there's this difficulty in an

1234
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:05,069
asymmetry of information again this

1235
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:07,779
leads to higher premiums lower limits

1236
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:09,460
the third issue that that's causing

1237
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:12,460
problems is the idea of correlated

1238
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,440
losses you know a good example of a

1239
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:18,039
correlated loss is a hurricane you have

1240
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,900
homeowners insurance they know house is

1241
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:21,009
going to burn down you know this house

1242
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,019
is going to get our house is going to

1243
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:24,549
get robbed and that's kind of random and

1244
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:27,609
they're pretty good at that a correlated

1245
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:29,529
loss is a hurricane if you're insuring a

1246
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,839
bunch of people in Miami pretty much

1247
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:33,880
everybody in that market is going to

1248
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,380
have a loss at the same time insurance

1249
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,210
companies don't like that they like to

1250
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,609
spread losses out they like to smooth

1251
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,470
and so they don't like hurricanes and so

1252
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,940
it's an unavoidable but the way they

1253
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:46,328
avoid correlated loss is in the

1254
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,740
homeowners world is if they're selling

1255
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,299
policies that cover that type of awesome

1256
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,950
yourself some in Florida yourself some

1257
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,559
in San Diego I'm going to sell some in

1258
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,430
Maine so that you know one hurricane

1259
00:47:53,559 --> 00:48:00,069
doesn't infect their entire portfolio

1260
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:02,769
that has been is nobody knows what the

1261
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:05,500
kind of cyber hurricane is going to look

1262
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:07,209
like and you know there's concepts that

1263
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,809
you guys understand way better than I do

1264
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:12,759
about connected nodes and you know as

1265
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:14,230
far as i understand it pretty much

1266
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:16,150
everyone's running on Amazon Web

1267
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,460
Services these days you know and so

1268
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,380
there's this idea of is there going to

1269
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,920
be this event that they can't

1270
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:26,710
uncorrelated affects every single in

1271
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,299
short a business interruption that goes

1272
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,880
across their portfolio and that scares

1273
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:33,670
them to death because they don't know

1274
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,940
how to deal with it and so what are the

1275
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:39,279
solutions to that but one is is the

1276
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,480
government solution so tria I don't know

1277
00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:42,940
if any of you guys have ever heard of it

1278
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,250
it's the terrorism risk insurance act

1279
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,289
and this was a result of September 11

1280
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,410
September 11th was a disaster for

1281
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:53,859
insurance companies it was way it was a

1282
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,690
way bigger risk than then they knew they

1283
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:59,288
were undertaking nobody thought that

1284
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:02,829
type of event was possible and there was

1285
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:04,240
a lot of correlated losses and so what

1286
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:06,730
happened in the wake of September 11th

1287
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,270
terrorism was written out of first party

1288
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,280
property policy he just couldn't

1289
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,259
coverage for it and so the government

1290
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,480
stepped in and they started acting as a

1291
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,010
reinsurer they said hey insurance

1292
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,870
companies you know what will reinsure

1293
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:20,600
eighty cents on the dollar if you start

1294
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:22,339
selling terrorism insurance again and so

1295
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,650
that was the solution there and so

1296
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,750
there's a professor at butler who his

1297
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,910
big thing is this is where we have to go

1298
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,280
with with with cyber insurances there's

1299
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:34,460
got to be some government intervention

1300
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,620
to kind of push premiums back down and

1301
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,240
that debt intervention is maybe you know

1302
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,310
offering reinsurance for the

1303
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,839
catastrophic event you know after a

1304
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:46,040
certain threshold at a certain

1305
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,190
percentage the problem with that is the

1306
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,750
lack of uniformity you know even the

1307
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,790
government wants to make sure that it's

1308
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:55,400
reassuring the same thing for AIG that

1309
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,190
it's very ensuring for travelers and so

1310
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,420
there's this push right now between

1311
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:01,970
Insurance Commissioners insurance

1312
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,490
policies insurance companies to kind of

1313
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,980
create some uniformity but it's proving

1314
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:09,890
incredibly difficult because competition

1315
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:12,350
wins out above cooperation and so you

1316
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,120
know the the the Insurance Commissioners

1317
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:16,310
around the country they're trying to get

1318
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,049
carriers to share actuarial data hey

1319
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,490
we'll have a bigger pot of information

1320
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,840
if you tell us what's happening with

1321
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,609
your insurance will tell you what's

1322
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,050
happening with ours but of course it's

1323
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,540
one of these things where nobody wants

1324
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:28,190
to blink first because everyone thinks

1325
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,020
that maybe they've got the secret

1326
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,490
formula and that their next next issue

1327
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,170
into the next round of policies the

1328
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,069
issue is going to solve the problem and

1329
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,260
they're going to be the leader in the

1330
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,400
marketplace so but this is where it's

1331
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,440
going to have to go there's going to

1332
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,780
have to be some uniformity that creates

1333
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,270
expectations and that and that gives

1334
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:47,750
people what really i think everyone

1335
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:50,390
wants which is i want to buy insurance

1336
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,220
for these events that i understand what

1337
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,170
they cover and how they cover it I don't

1338
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,330
want this to be a guessing game I don't

1339
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,730
want this to be an exercise in and where

1340
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,259
a comma is in a sentence I just want I

1341
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:05,270
want to tell you what my expectations

1342
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:06,650
are and I want you to cover it and like

1343
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,060
I said I know I'm running out of time so

1344
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:13,130
I'll stop there but is there any

1345
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:15,529
questions or anybody yeah

1346
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,940
so you say that you know something that

1347
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:19,009
they're actively trying to figure out is

1348
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,660
that are they sitting in a room thinking

1349
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,579
about it looking at historical data or

1350
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,078
is it more of we'll try this see how it

1351
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,730
works out and then pivot from there and

1352
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,980
where's day you mean the insurance

1353
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,750
companies it yeah I mean they've got

1354
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,940
more data now than they did say four

1355
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,980
years ago but it's it's it's it's a work

1356
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,289
in progress I mean they're getting a

1357
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,670
little bit better about rating this what

1358
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:39,920
some insurance companies are actually

1359
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,079
looking at right now is actually kind of

1360
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,819
developing or acquiring their own

1361
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,039
security platform and pushing those two

1362
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:48,650
insured's and giving people discounts

1363
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,809
for hey if you take this company and

1364
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,670
pass you know it's a independent company

1365
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:55,910
that we've acquired we want you to use

1366
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,710
their their security platform then of

1367
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,328
course the insurance company can monitor

1368
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,339
you know that you're actually using it

1369
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:03,910
you know that's one solution but yeah

1370
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:06,740
they're trying everything there's just

1371
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,680
it's it's difficult because it's

1372
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:15,529
difficult to define the next risk and

1373
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:17,419
that's the scary part for them I will

1374
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:20,319
thank you guys and it was a pleasure

1375
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,319
thanks for having me

1376
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,480
