1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,740
good morning everyone my name is by Jan

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,470
young but I had a hard time I just

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,229
started out here in the US without a

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,470
sort of a nickname so people always men

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,509
mitten bunch of mistakes and pronounce

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,920
my name right out my name and I thought

7
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,680
you know what to make everybody's life

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,540
easier just I just come up with say you

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,280
know sort of like a nickname so I go by

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,830
adjusting my students all which is call

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,410
me Justin and i'm going to introduce one

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,199
of the very interesting kind of

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,279
educational piece of a cyber security

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,540
project i'm currently involved with and

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280
that before we talk about that

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,739
particular project called I tree buoy

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,390
site tricep see I want to briefly

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,000
mention some of the challenges we are

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,479
facing I think then one challenge we're

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,810
facing is the shortage of qualified IT

21
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,420
security professionals so the key word

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,720
here is qualified so I think of one

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,890
speaker talked about in the morning

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,170
there's a government agency try to hire

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,000
people but then couldn't feel simply

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,549
fill out of the positions simply because

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,530
the folks we have don't have the right

28
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,390
skills right so this one of the

29
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,920
challenges we are facing and then if

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,350
you're looking at the cyber security by

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,290
yourself it's a multi-disciplinary it's

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,229
very complex and often it's more than

33
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,979
just doing the secure coding and I

34
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:46,789
always have a perspective of users are

35
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,789
the weakest link in this cyber security

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,229
system so users are the ones that often

37
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,270
you know didn't really pay a whole lot

38
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,710
of tension they're the ones to probably

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,140
get the viruses installed on their

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,229
programs so just by doing the

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,210
cybersecurity the secure coding itself

42
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,189
probably cannot fix the problem so

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,770
that's just my perception so we need

44
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,289
more people to wear what's going on we

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,260
want people know what are the what are

46
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:14,239
the real things what's really about

47
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,340
something about for example SSL

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,110
stripping what exactly can does it to

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,420
your computer what is something like

50
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,670
heartbleed attack white cost billions of

51
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,488
dollars for the full industry to fix

52
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,890
that particular incidents so those are

53
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,470
things that's kind of really big all

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,989
there

55
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,760
for people to understand another thing

56
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,670
this is the whole thing is so dynamic

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,440
you probably I mean I'm teaching the

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,149
cybersecurity classes one of the things

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,520
I have loved a trouble to do is just

60
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,800
reuse some of the core materials I

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,140
developed last semester so I designed a

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,090
lab I beautifully demonstrate this can

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,010
be done in my system and next semester

64
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,020
guess what you have to redo everything

65
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,850
because whatever the vulnerability

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,120
you're trying to talk to you student you

67
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,280
simply cannot reuse that symptom again

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,140
because you know your your system is

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,550
different now so it's really hard to

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,000
produce so that's basically the

71
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,220
challenges we're facing right now and

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,920
thanks to the keynote a dr. Greg Shannon

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,750
and he had this a great vision and he

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,000
want to come up with something that can

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,480
accelerate innovation in cyber security

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,090
and privacy where this curated online

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,329
access to high fidelity technical

78
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:29,850
experiences so Greg when he was the

79
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,740
president of the chairperson of the it's

80
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,600
a chairperson or president chair yeah

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,459
well he was a chair of the cyber

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,670
security I to be cyber security

83
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,830
initiative so he realized this is

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,399
something much needed so he came up with

85
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,230
a solution this vision and talk to the

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,260
people in the community and try to come

87
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,190
up with something that can solve some

88
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,489
part of the challenges so the the one of

89
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,930
the biggest problem we have right now is

90
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,390
when we're using the cybersecurity we

91
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,510
have to rely a lot of the technology

92
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,829
extremely hard to produce results and it

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,739
really difficult to run something up

94
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,049
demo and here's the thing you have all

95
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,420
the different tools you can download you

96
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,430
can play with and guess you reality

97
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,680
what's happening you download the tour

98
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,500
number one thing you got realizes oops

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,630
you got a compile compliation there you

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,150
run through the poor one you download a

101
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,700
program because it's more likely to open

102
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,739
source it has runny different kind of

103
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,200
library making different kind of

104
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,300
assumption about your system so number

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,979
one what battle you have to fight is or

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,960
I have to come have to figure out a way

107
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,659
how to make the system really compile I

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,460
have to go 10 to the make file I have to

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,310
update my libraries and all that making

110
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,180
sure i can come

111
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,950
although this file and then you probably

112
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,150
pass this age and then the next thing

113
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,070
you're going to realize it's okay you

114
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,560
still have something wrong with your

115
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,430
system so you still cannot pass it

116
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,680
installation or in some cases you your

117
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,600
installation is really you know you can

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,460
smoothly instead of per one but it

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,460
simply cannot start the process that

120
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,489
happened to many of open source software

121
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,530
i played with it's very specific about

122
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,240
the version of what kind of linux system

123
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,260
you using what kind of unique system

124
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,020
using so e NS you know people are very

125
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,150
patient right we will simply you know

126
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,760
close a web browser if that web page is

127
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,859
not loading in eight seconds okay so

128
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,650
eight seconds we could we can just

129
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,840
simply turn up the browser and fixing

130
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,630
those compliation air probably take you

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,539
no good hours or in some cases a few

132
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,159
days or even weeks okay so we have that

133
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,400
kind of problem so it certainly easier

134
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,680
way to solve this problem so won't

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,539
approach we can we can think about is

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,660
well are there any way we can build this

137
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,150
kind of a web based approach where all

138
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,600
the tools can be accessible from the web

139
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,460
browser and in the back end what we

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,020
trying to come up with is using some

141
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,060
sort of virtualization technology

142
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,640
specifically we're using docker simply

143
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,350
because it's a lightweight so we can

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,800
hook up the web browser with the docker

145
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,630
image and in terms of hardware because

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,670
we're leaving in the age of cloud

147
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,400
computing age so we can simply using the

148
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,200
cloud and specifically in the in this I

149
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,049
to be project we use in the Amazon ec2

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,120
to allow dynamic you know resource

151
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,400
allocations that know that so we with

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,770
that kind of architecture we just

153
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,679
proposed I will just briefly touch on

154
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,020
the design of this project so the users

155
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,490
on the bottom here and the very first

156
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,950
thing is they're going to log on to the

157
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,810
I to be tried a tricep see website by

158
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:46,810
the way the URL is tri-dot on cyber

159
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,380
security I trouble you org so you just

160
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,990
log on to the website and the base on

161
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,289
the the website will give you at the

162
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,879
moment it will give you 11 different you

163
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,909
cases you're going to pick one of them

164
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,149
and based on the scenario you're going

165
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,550
to pick we ate or directed you did two

166
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,949
different scenario once if you're using

167
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,189
some of the coding basic containers and

168
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:13,050
we'll go with Amazon ec2 container

169
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,770
services because it's really easy to

170
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,680
make and it will dynamically allocate

171
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,359
resources very easily however if you

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,699
pick some of the network attack based

173
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,520
scenario it will go to some of the

174
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,860
container we are we created because we

175
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,628
have to build additional bridges to

176
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,059
making sure that one container is not

177
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,830
you know in turf acting with interfere

178
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:39,169
with other containers so going from

179
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:42,479
there it will connect to the backend

180
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:45,109
amazon containers and going from there

181
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,058
it will load the fetch docker image and

182
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,389
then return the container URL back to

183
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:53,610
the the web interface and then the user

184
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,770
can click on that application URL and

185
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,789
begin to play with the tool from the web

186
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,740
browser I believe our design is capable

187
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,719
of working with any of the mobile

188
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,729
devices as long as you have a physical

189
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,248
keyboard it is not working extremely

190
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,830
well with the touch screen at the moment

191
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:12,180
it's something we're working on um but

192
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,219
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure is

193
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,759
working perfectly on most of the

194
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,860
computers so eventually those are the 12

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,379
containers in the first batch the only

196
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,699
thing we're missing here is the RSA this

197
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,199
RSA is some of the cryptography projects

198
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,629
that's already made it's already there

199
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,779
but it's you're still casting so so far

200
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:35,909
we posted 11 on the website layout is

201
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,559
slightly different simply because we

202
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,688
haven't put them into right categories

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,328
yet but eventually we're looking at here

204
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:44,218
we have a three different use cases on

205
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:46,560
the networking attacked kind of

206
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,199
explaining what is arps ARP spoofing

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,750
well how do you do ssl stripping and why

208
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:54,660
ssl stripping are able to get you know

209
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,949
achieve your username and password even

210
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,009
though you're running something like

211
00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:02,430
https so we have those and those are the

212
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,620
network-based the containers is highly

213
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,719
vulnerable so we put a lot of lot of the

214
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,139
security features in the back end making

215
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,179
sure that there's really self-contained

216
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,519
still a date there will be no hun be

217
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,738
able to you know launch ARP spoofing on

218
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,389
the gateway of the back end the server

219
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:20,689
so we did a little bit of security

220
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:23,989
control over there and then we also have

221
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:27,469
a second category go as a secure coding

222
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:30,980
we're security basics so we're looking

223
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,989
at some of the high-profile incidents or

224
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,029
some of the really common mistakes when

225
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:38,569
people trying to write their programs so

226
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:41,089
we have a heart bleed exploit that kind

227
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,219
of container kind of explain exactly

228
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,519
what is happening two years ago about

229
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,829
Harley break ah and we show you the code

230
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,109
that has trouble will also tell you how

231
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,878
people fix the problem and then you know

232
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,319
we give that information to you and I

233
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,179
can tell you this we actually spend

234
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,399
quite a bit time just try to find the

235
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,799
right version simply because you're

236
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,410
currently unix systems / linux system

237
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:07,369
they're smart enough even if you load

238
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,829
older version of the g lipsy a still be

239
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:12,410
able to fix the problem so just simply

240
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:14,569
we produced a problem took our team

241
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,669
quite a time just finding the

242
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:18,618
combination of everything to / send it

243
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:20,779
there so at the moment I think there

244
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,610
there's little bit more I want to work

245
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:26,059
on this a particular instance to make it

246
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,850
more you know interactive but but we are

247
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:31,399
able to reproduce what is going on and

248
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,939
of course old-fashioned sequel injection

249
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,249
it's really easy to understand using a

250
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:39,618
container like a case and the resource

251
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:42,889
authorization we really linked to that

252
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:45,559
whomped i truly white paper on the top

253
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:48,110
10 design flaws and we want to kind of

254
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,329
demonstrate there's something called you

255
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,179
always need to do authentication before

256
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:55,099
you do authorization you should always a

257
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:57,350
force that kind of thing happen so we

258
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,720
come up with a scenario to demonstrate

259
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,309
that particular use case and then the

260
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,399
server category we're really looking at

261
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:06,889
all the interesting research projects

262
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
not all the research projects can be

263
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,929
done in this fashion like the wonderful

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,299
talk you gave about the about a

265
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:16,039
smartphone imaging retrieval and

266
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,369
visualization I think it will be

267
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:21,559
difficult to put out there but there are

268
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,250
a lot of tools can be done using this

269
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,780
kind of fashion

270
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,570
were able to working with some of the

271
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,610
attributes acuity a centipede officers

272
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,180
we communicate with them we're able to

273
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,800
make a few of them possible and this is

274
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,130
fairly interesting and I believe this

275
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,199
should be something up we want to push

276
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,080
really push forward because if you have

277
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,360
some state art research project you want

278
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,790
people to see what is going on you don't

279
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,100
want people to spend hours and days and

280
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,740
even weeks to reproduce your results and

281
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,460
I can tell you just reproduce this work

282
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,920
take our entire team two weeks just to

283
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,980
reduce one simply because there are too

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,420
many issues was the the Linux version

285
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,980
where peg we tried so many different

286
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,349
versions of Linux try to so many

287
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,960
versions of the compilers we just simply

288
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,900
cannot get exactly results the the

289
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,880
author Scott so so just if we can get

290
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,709
everything down we can clear up all the

291
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,060
dependencies make this make sure it's

292
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,220
available on the web interface and

293
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,869
everybody can take a look and then going

294
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,200
from there I think everybody's life it'd

295
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,200
be easier and the force category are

296
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,260
three use cases of developing

297
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,490
cryptography work and we know

298
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,280
cryptography is extremely extremely

299
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,410
important and every tiny implementation

300
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,850
is important so we have a one as a

301
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:44,380
padding Oracle attack and its really

302
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:49,940
leveraging how your browser's or how the

303
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:52,790
the I think it's a CPC box I for how

304
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,790
they react to the padding so they will

305
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,490
give you a error indicating your padding

306
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,260
is now right so so attacker can leverage

307
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,390
in that kind of knowledge and be able to

308
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,490
figure out what might be the cases of

309
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,410
your encrypted code so three outstanding

310
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,350
really well-designed cryptography

311
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,650
projects is actually the sum of the

312
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,470
projects is being done by university of

313
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,910
maryland they're the teaching the

314
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,310
cryptography class those are the three

315
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,160
course project contributed by jonathan

316
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,810
katz from university of maryland so so

317
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,110
those sort of things we have right now

318
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:34,219
of course we can build up this whatever

319
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,750
available pieces and those sort of

320
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,440
things we have and

321
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,200
I have a very short video oops you know

322
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,930
what I have a very short video I I think

323
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:51,950
it might be four minutes just briefly

324
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:53,780
talking about how it's a I can do the

325
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,340
voiceover that so this is an earlier

326
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,800
stage when we made a seven of those

327
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,560
containers and what happened here is you

328
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,680
just pick one of those and then going

329
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,849
from here you're going to read in

330
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,130
description what is the project about

331
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,170
what is a you know how are you going to

332
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,120
do this so it will link to whatever the

333
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:17,900
project you have and then you can click

334
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:20,900
on try it and we used to do Google

335
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,850
gotcha syllabus just making sure that we

336
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,949
don't get the United service attack our

337
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,750
own web server so going from there the

338
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,330
group at you can basically pick on some

339
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,160
of the images go from there and you can

340
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,240
hit the lunch and then you basically

341
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,170
have a few of the system going to be

342
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,750
available so if you click on lunch so in

343
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,459
this particular case we present a two

344
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,560
different things so you're going to

345
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,260
using a one type of server one tab for

346
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,869
client and another tab is just for

347
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,060
instructions so so even though we made

348
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,580
it so that you can do it on I've had it

349
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,459
will be so much easier to do it you know

350
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,860
using multiple monitors on my desktop or

351
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,960
laptop so so those are the instructions

352
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,820
most of these structures are pretty

353
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,530
straightforward it tells you what to do

354
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,930
so you should be able to follow the

355
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,240
instructions be able to achieve most of

356
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,709
it and then towards the end is where we

357
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,420
surround some really challenging

358
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,400
question we ask you to think about

359
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,900
certain things that's a typical design

360
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,360
of the system and if you're and we also

361
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,180
encourages the users to take the survey

362
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,880
it turns out the users are not very you

363
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,849
suz astok about taking out a survey so

364
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,510
we so far away probably have 55 users

365
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,640
gives us of a few out of survey but the

366
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,910
survey responses were pretty positive

367
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,699
and just from the over about what

368
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,870
happened in a little bit for about 45

369
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,310
days and those are the the users that we

370
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,670
have and

371
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,349
as you know the number is now great

372
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,589
simple because not many people are aware

373
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,830
we have this project going and we spend

374
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,450
more time developing the program rather

375
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,370
than making sure that everybody knows

376
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,140
about this project so we're going to

377
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,420
certainly do a lot more promoting at the

378
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,540
program but right now just look at the

379
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,520
map we realize one thing we probably

380
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,319
should have make the project available

381
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,660
in multiple languages rather than just

382
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,029
in English because initially we have a

383
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,600
lot of people from from China from other

384
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,360
countries starting out of using this and

385
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,010
then a day two days three just nobody

386
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,350
coming simply because they couldn't

387
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,890
follow the following structure exactly

388
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,500
the same but anyway those are the basic

389
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,500
data here and break down to different

390
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,140
use cases our current perception was

391
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,740
appears to be anything that addressing

392
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:48,189
the basics attract more users for

393
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,230
example ARP spoofing SSL scraping

394
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:54,800
attract a lot of people and access it

395
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,350
honey pot and the I think there should

396
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,630
be once really high profile a heart

397
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,460
bleed also attract a lot of users so

398
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,780
anything that people take a look it's

399
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,760
not oh this is interesting I want to

400
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,609
take a look at it appears to be very

401
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,740
attractive to the different users but as

402
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,329
you can see we spend a lot of effort

403
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,280
trying to make some something really

404
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,639
interesting available to ever want on

405
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,280
but users we don't have enough user

406
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,560
space to tell us how they feel about it

407
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,629
whether it's really making sense or not

408
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,919
so the good thing is we are going to

409
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,959
make more people to know about this

410
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,020
project I two buoys officially going to

411
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,460
roll out this project a nuisance I think

412
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,790
in news announcements pretty soon and

413
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,760
the thing we learned it from from the

414
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,920
numbers is it turns out of word of mouth

415
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,420
really make a huge difference if you

416
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,820
just simply sending out email you sent

417
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,530
to organization say hey we have this

418
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,510
thing going on chances are you're not

419
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,100
going to track a lot of users okay you

420
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,480
probably really want to talk to your

421
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,610
colleague is telling them hey you know

422
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,470
what I try this is really interesting

423
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,729
maybe you can give it a try as well so

424
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,880
that turns out to be a very successful

425
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,040
recruiting so we realize you to pass

426
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,630
this information and talk to some people

427
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,020
that you know about and we certainly

428
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,890
need

429
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,080
build a much stronger mud a broader

430
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,970
collaborative network making sure that

431
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,980
if you have something wonderful if you

432
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,390
have some tools or some of the research

433
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,570
going on you want to share this with

434
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,460
everybody just please contact us um and

435
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,669
we need to trans translate that one into

436
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,430
multiple languages and in addition to

437
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,400
this I just want to make it clear there

438
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,470
one way you can make this contribution

439
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,570
pretty easily because currently we have

440
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,050
to type of containers one of the docker

441
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,179
containers where is where its hook up to

442
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,909
the web interface those those are the 12

443
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,470
containers I talked about but you can

444
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,930
actually just using whatever your

445
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,510
containers docker containers and we can

446
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,520
add the link on this I tributo tricep

447
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,590
see website so there will be a portal

448
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,540
there will be a link to the container

449
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,790
used to make we don't have to make it

450
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,920
you know using the web interface peoples

451
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,750
can simply download your containers be

452
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,300
able to save your work and go from there

453
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,060
and we do have some of the instructions

454
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,830
for doing this and I just quickly goes

455
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,560
through the process if you're interested

456
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:13,120
in making this happen making sure your

457
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,889
applications are linux and unix are

458
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,719
compatible because ryan out windows is

459
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,580
not supporting it but the good news is

460
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,800
if you're thinking about a windows is

461
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,860
already pushing out a bash shell so

462
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,750
likely windows is going to you know be

463
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,419
able to support donker as well so making

464
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,430
sure it's a supported and you can

465
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,440
develop on your darker file you pick

466
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,630
some of the base images go from there

467
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,660
you start all dependencies in your

468
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,020
applications and we recommend two

469
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,120
different kind of base image once using

470
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,250
something kind of wacky that's for any

471
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,449
of the command why you space the other

472
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:53,360
one is the VNC based image so we already

473
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,410
created to base images depends on

474
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,090
whether you have a graphic user

475
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,950
interface will not don't have a

476
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,540
graphical user interface and go from

477
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,240
there you can just create your app it

478
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,950
should be pretty easy process once it's

479
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,440
being done you just simply build image

480
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,650
and the push image to the dr hopf and go

481
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,040
from there we can pull your image and

482
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:15,140
and get it on the I tribal I chubby

483
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,850
website and as you can see here those

484
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,500
are the darker file looks like

485
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,379
I actually pretty easy for this to the

486
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,960
forward you just just tell a docker

487
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,520
containers the base image one of the

488
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,320
things you need to install what version

489
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,330
of the things you need put in there and

490
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,370
your doc images it's going to show you

491
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,679
all the images you have with all the

492
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,330
different kind of verses and you login

493
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,310
to your doctor and then you can push the

494
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,070
images and you can specify what kind of

495
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,080
version you want so you could try many

496
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,510
different things and this is really a

497
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,689
great tool to you know promote your own

498
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,150
research work or educational work so

499
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,430
what's going to happen next is where we

500
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,290
kind of sealed debating where the things

501
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,910
should be going but we certainly want

502
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,639
more containers with soonly wanted more

503
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,990
users to try out a project but it's in

504
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,930
the discussion we're going to do this

505
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,110
home security challenges and using this

506
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,870
I tribal a tricep see website well in

507
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,419
the long run I think we it is possible

508
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,070
we can build this digital hands-on

509
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,720
library simply because you mean all the

510
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,419
tools that their dependencies no longer

511
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,090
issue and we do see a great value of

512
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,870
doing this and by the way if you read

513
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:27,159
the news lately you know Pentagon is all

514
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:30,350
kind of working in certain way with the

515
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,870
hackers they were going to reward

516
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,429
hackers if they are able to take him

517
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,590
down some of the non crucial websites

518
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,960
for Pentagon I think they get caught

519
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,209
hack hack the Pentagon project so

520
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,910
there's something I mean a long line we

521
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,730
want to give the educator researchers

522
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,680
and users opportunity work on some of

523
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,820
the really challenging security

524
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:57,020
questions and I we don't want to thank
