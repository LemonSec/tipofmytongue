1
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,190
ok so it's like we can start

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,880
hi everyone today I am very glad to

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,260
introduce a Maria interviews from Cisco

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,390
her professional credentials are

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,849
comprised of 20 years of experience in

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,340
engineering department of defense

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,030
solutions for hardware software pki and

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,520
network systems she has multiple patents

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,920
and has co-authored protected documents

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,780
around cyber security and other

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,720
confidential solutions in the security

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:04,849
area today she will be talking about

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:06,740
intelligent cyber security thank you so

14
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,339
too today we're going to discuss

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,460
improving outcomes with services here

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:17,920
with me is a senior here at Purdue Shawn

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,809
gladden and he's one of our top analysts

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,220
so it's going to be exciting to hear him

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,590
speak today as well to the audience here

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:31,610
absolutely so just some quick oversight

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,230
in regards to information security the

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,540
digital evolution where you have the

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,910
digital company and the internet of

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,440
everything is which which is where Cisco

25
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:44,179
solely operates in IOT so the internet

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:51,080
of everything is really the mother of

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:52,580
all markets and transitions moving on in

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,289
the digital evolution we have the

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,660
digital company where you see the mobile

30
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,760
fourteen percent cloud five to ten and

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,440
then you have I OT which is ninety

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,110
percent so what happens when this is all

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,419
out there for everyone access you have

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,908
security challenges you need to change

35
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,399
some business models some dynamic threat

36
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:21,760
landscape and also some complexity and

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,760
fragmentation within those you'll see

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,010
sorry I wanted to walk out to three

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,649
within those you'll see the different

40
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,730
areas and how they rate for each of the

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,730
three areas we spoke about earlier

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,500
most of our threats are hidden in plain

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:46,160
sight the number one biggest threat and

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,640
pretty much any area agency or company

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,870
would probably be the insider threat so

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,119
you have a lot of the companies nowadays

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,390
have you bringing in BYOD ch where you

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,100
stick into your company network but you

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,029
most of them should give you the option

50
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,329
to where they will remove all your data

51
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:10,640
even if it is your own device since it's

52
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:13,030
connected to their network some of the

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,239
security silos complicate protection

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,710
reason being is the way they lay out the

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,050
different various services that can

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,300
actually help them in assisting in

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,300
providing against any types of threats

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,870
so this is our cisco hypothesis where

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,540
you have the digital evolution

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:40,090
operational focus talent shortage and

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,859
they go across all these various

62
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,350
business units visibility threat

63
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:51,890
platform advisory integration and

64
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:54,500
managed these are some examples of where

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,109
our intelligence come from and how much

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,600
we really see so there's daily security

67
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,600
intelligence go ahead

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:21,228
Oh go back there we go you guys see that

69
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:28,240
that's a pretty significant amount of

70
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:30,889
data the security services portfolio

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,470
between advisory integration and managed

72
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:40,789
services shows you the various areas and

73
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:42,620
how each one is unique some of the

74
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,930
security advisories we have risk and

75
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:52,310
compliance ioe security and then we also

76
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:53,690
have threat management our incident

77
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,780
response services we have an amazing

78
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,110
incident response service team as well

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,289
as all the other teams involved they're

80
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,240
the first ones like any emergency

81
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:08,560
essential personnel to triage anything

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:15,380
that comes into the into that we ingest

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:17,889
to verify some of the integrated

84
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,479
security solutions with integration

85
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:27,560
migration and optimization those are

86
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,909
some of the different areas that yeah

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,800
some of the different areas that were

88
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:33,440
able to communicate with depending on

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
the hardware and some of course our

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,620
hardware and the different things that

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,449
we can connect product support hosted

92
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:47,330
security and managed security where you

93
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:51,130
have your advanced threat analytics so

94
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,130
this is the time put your glasses on so

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,139
with a TA we have analytics people

96
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,139
intelligence and technology

97
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,290
ata is a variety of things within the

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,349
ATA that we operate in within the

99
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,840
security operations center we do a

100
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,670
variety of things this shows you how in

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,520
each realm for analytics people

102
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:26,400
technology and intelligence where we may

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:29,909
gather and correlate this information so

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,270
what it enables ATA which is us we

105
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,750
enable speed accuracy and focus so we

106
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,729
give you the ability for rapid threat

107
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,420
detection reduces the mean time to

108
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,460
respond high fidelity cuts down on false

109
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,670
positives and then increase visibility

110
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:54,539
and control illuminates security blind

111
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:58,550
spots within that many of our customers

112
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,730
receive many benefits as some of those

113
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,830
comprehensive coverage strategic focus

114
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:11,310
customer relations risk mitigation and

115
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:14,760
proactive security so some of the

116
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,340
scalable sets that are out there for the

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:22,830
different clients can be an essentials

118
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,450
enhanced in a premier package the

119
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,099
different the different various ones

120
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,650
give you different levels and enhanced

121
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,370
security some edits another step give

122
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,530
you intrusion prevention system some

123
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,060
monitoring your modules adding in

124
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,409
different equipment so it depends on

125
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,960
what you're looking at for your network

126
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,210
and how you want to have a redundant

127
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,030
backup and or some sort of security

128
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:51,150
backup for it let's start with the

129
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:54,390
threat landscape Yeah right I guess it's

130
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,039
my turn so for the threat landscape we

131
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,800
have nineteen point seven billion total

132
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,970
threat blocks daily which is seven point

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,890
two trillion yearly where as you can see

134
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,280
on the graph or on the little pie chart

135
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:11,460
82,000 virus blocks 181 million spyware

136
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,969
blocks 818 million web blocks which

137
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,109
since I'm an analytics i'm a member of

138
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,390
our analytics person

139
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,150
my job is to actually filter through all

140
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,610
this so what we end up doing is on our

141
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,049
system it Flags all these different

142
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,880
threats then it hits the the analysts

143
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,860
excuse me it's the analysts and then

144
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,570
it's up to us in order to filter out

145
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,940
what's a false positive what's a true

146
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,860
positive and then escalated as necessary

147
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,790
that true positive is it something that

148
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,289
got blocked by the customers firewall or

149
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:48,620
was it something that got through the

150
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:52,110
firewall and got onto a system we are

151
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,910
Talos multi-tiered defense Talos is an

152
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,310
organization within Cisco that does a

153
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,910
lot of our security research so they're

154
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,579
on the bleeding edge of what the

155
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:07,760
scariest stuff out there is so you'll

156
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,760
hear a term called zero day which is a

157
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,020
vulnerability that has not been released

158
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,630
especially by the companies that have

159
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,560
them so a zero day and Adobe that's

160
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,470
something that's very common

161
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,329
unfortunately is an Adobe vulnerability

162
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,650
that Adobe doesn't know if it's an

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,200
unaware of Tallus is on the bleeding

164
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,790
edge of figuring those out and they're

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,790
divided into these five departments each

166
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,620
department is integral into what Alice

167
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,850
does so the threat intelligence that's

168
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,410
what I was just talking about where

169
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,020
they're the ones who are actively trying

170
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,510
to figure out these zero days they see

171
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,150
new malware they break it down detection

172
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,210
research there they find what are called

173
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,240
our indicators of compromise so if a

174
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,460
system is infected with something what

175
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,830
about it gives away the infection does

176
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,080
it have a pop-up does it do some

177
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,570
something weird on the network that's an

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,350
indicator of compromise outreach they're

179
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,820
the people who will go out and talk to

180
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,740
the leaders of our organizations tell

181
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,140
them what the newest threat is they'll

182
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,820
go if they find a zero-day they're the

183
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,860
ones who go to Adobe and say hey you

184
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,400
have a zero-day here's what it is here's

185
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,600
how you fix it vulnerability rd they're

186
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,069
just basically wrapped into the threat

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,980
intelligence so they're the ones that

188
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,900
are actively trying to find and create

189
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,420
malware in order to try to block it and

190
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,579
then our engine development so that's

191
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,750
the intelligent systems web anemal Intel

192
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,570
they're the ones who are doing our

193
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,210
sandboxes so a lot of this malware has

194
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,580
gotten very very smart and knows if

195
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,800
we're trying to figure out it's there so

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,630
we create a sandbox basically a fake

197
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,270
computer or if you're familiar with it a

198
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:50,010
virtual machine and we let them out

199
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:52,110
where it do its job and we watch it we

200
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,060
have our intelligence framework so our

201
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,820
intelligence feeds our common things

202
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,640
you've probably heard of whitelist

203
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,940
blacklist known IP addresses and domains

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,160
for malware DNS so the common things

205
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,840
that you would see around

206
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,670
industry-specific that would be partners

207
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,970
and customers so the customers that we

208
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,910
do our work with we work very closely

209
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,650
with in order to make sure hey if you

210
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,930
see something strange you let us know

211
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,880
about it if we find some intelligence

212
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,219
well let you know about it so we work

213
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,100
very very close with the customers open

214
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,840
source virustotal malware calm hyper

215
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,130
analysis these are all websites you can

216
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,230
go to and see hey what are the

217
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,210
indicators compromise for this or I've

218
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,680
got the suspicious file so you throw it

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,130
on there and they do the sandboxing for

220
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:45,719
you cisco unique intelligence our source

221
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:48,480
fire which is our IDs system very good

222
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,730
very very good at catching bad stuff

223
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,020
going through network we have threat

224
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,250
grid which is our proprietary sandbox

225
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,880
Talos which is the organization that I

226
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,980
talked about a few slides ago opendns I

227
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,550
think that was last year or two years

228
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,030
ago we acquired opendns I think so there

229
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,229
is a public version in a private version

230
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,390
the private version costs money the

231
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,000
public version is still open dns free

232
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,010
for everyone to use and then our threat

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,590
information platform so we have our

234
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,180
internal bu data or focused feeds and

235
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,190
intelligence so what we get off of the

236
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,689
customers will do the number crunching

237
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,040
on it and find anything new so tell us

238
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,050
likes to pride themselves and finding a

239
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,089
lot of this ransomware and being able to

240
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,420
mitigate it so a lot of you might have

241
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:40,260
heard of locky or cryptex or a lot of

242
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,760
these bad ransom waves that have been

243
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,889
floating around but basically lock up

244
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,569
your systems and

245
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:49,609
hold them hostage what was the last

246
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:51,790
ransomware anyone heard of that a

247
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:54,049
hospital wasn't involved with ransomware

248
00:12:51,790 --> 00:13:01,309
do you know what the name of that ransom

249
00:12:54,049 --> 00:13:04,220
or was that's okay it's fine probably

250
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:06,589
not a whole lot Sam Sam that was the big

251
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,480
kick the big campaign it was Sam Sam and

252
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,559
then there's actually recently been a

253
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,569
lot another locky campaign so that

254
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,868
vertical the health industry vertical is

255
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:20,618
a very very common big target for

256
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:22,819
ransomware campaigns because has PII

257
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:24,980
exactly personal identifiable

258
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:26,899
information so and the the trick for

259
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,299
ransomware is they don't steal the info

260
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,799
they don't even look at it they just

261
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,980
encrypt it and say give us a million

262
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:36,679
dollars or you don't get it back and the

263
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,029
hospitals are going to pay for two

264
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,529
reasons one they need that information

265
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,359
to operate in two they don't want

266
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:45,649
anybody to know they were compromised so

267
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:48,259
they're going to pay so Talos will go

268
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,179
out and actively try to crack them our

269
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:52,579
so they're going to try to find the

270
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:58,639
decryption keys and try to save these

271
00:13:52,579 --> 00:14:01,040
hospitals money so the back the back

272
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,269
side of our source fireboxes our snort

273
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,089
and snore is a preprocessor that looks

274
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,309
at traffic as it goes through does some

275
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,980
very initial number crunching how many

276
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:15,410
of you familiar with regex or that

277
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,509
concept it's basically a super powerful

278
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,589
version of that so it's doing it on the

279
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:23,869
wire on the fly and we give it rules to

280
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:27,259
recognize certain regex in the packets

281
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:30,610
and the malware writers can get pretty

282
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:33,470
pretty involved in trying to dupe it so

283
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,559
instead of writing a character they'll

284
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,509
write it in hex or they'll write it in

285
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,939
HTML so the snort rules will figure that

286
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,999
out same thing with our clam AV

287
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:46,849
signature family so you can do

288
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:48,739
signature-based so a hash you take the

289
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,019
malware file turn it into a hash that

290
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:54,019
hashes a signature you just do signature

291
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,459
recognition which can be fairly quick

292
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,830
because once you've got the hash it's

293
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,680
just

294
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:03,270
up we have our analysis over you so

295
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,859
architecture we have our full packets

296
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:09,510
and this is part of what makes Cisco's

297
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,650
active threat analytics very very

298
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,930
powerful as we have access to full

299
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,300
packet capture to our premier customers

300
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,750
not all of our customers give it give it

301
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,150
to us but the premier side they do and

302
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,620
that's how we do a lot of our analysis

303
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,040
because once we have full pcap we can do

304
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,700
a lot with it it's a lot of pcap data

305
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,760
yes so one of our customers I think of

306
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,690
full day's worth of pcap is like on the

307
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:42,270
order of 50 to 100 terabytes depending

308
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:44,880
upon the customer sure so a pcap is a

309
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:49,290
paki capture so how many of you are

310
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,020
familiar with what a packet is okay also

311
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,120
fair number of you so what we're doing

312
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,189
is we're watching the wire for these

313
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,190
packets we're actively looking for it

314
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:03,440
and the way that an IDs works

315
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:07,740
achievement IPS is will split off a line

316
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,690
from the customers network and do it in

317
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,850
parallel where one of the line goes to

318
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,730
where it's supposed to go out to the ISP

319
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,800
the branch off the parallel goes into

320
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,670
our IPS and we look at what goes through

321
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,449
it and we'll capture that data and store

322
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,099
it for one of our customer actually for

323
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,350
two of our customers they're short for

324
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,000
an amount of time that's feasible for

325
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,100
that's what I was just about to say is

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,010
we have two clients where we get so much

327
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,240
pcap that we have to dump the data after

328
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:41,850
about a day right other clients have

329
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,010
much less traffic where we can store it

330
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,650
for a few days and that could be

331
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:49,400
something based on what part of the

332
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,400
network we're looking at

333
00:16:51,070 --> 00:17:04,190
absolutely please use your mic please

334
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,709
yes here yeah I want to ask about

335
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,230
anonymous network store so you see the

336
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,920
packet comes from nowhere and a source

337
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,260
IP is masked then so you analyze it so

338
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,530
Tor network nodes are known there's a

339
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:23,060
list of them and we're not ultimately

340
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,040
looking at the not necessarily the

341
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,379
destination but we can flag that it's

342
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,740
from a tor network which on our

343
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,070
customers tour node traffic is anomalous

344
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,050
so we're going to take a look at it if

345
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,689
it's encrypted there's only so much we

346
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,129
can do with it which I think might be

347
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,130
the source of your question is if it's

348
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,590
encrypted traffic yeah there's only so

349
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,860
much we can do with it but there's a lot

350
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,770
of metadata involved with that that

351
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:56,419
could be forensic Lee identified tonight

352
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:58,610
for the need so basically we could fare

353
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,850
it out if it's a tour node within their

354
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,530
network so we see the last node and then

355
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,149
out to the destination is that

356
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:11,360
destination to known bad yes or no or

357
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,660
even more simply are you seeing tour no

358
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,669
traffic on a production network so

359
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:20,390
you've got I'm just using example like

360
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:23,030
caterpillar so if you see toward no

361
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,610
traffic on caterpillar that's not right

362
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,690
that's anomalous so we can flag it and

363
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:32,719
get to the source of it but a lot of the

364
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:36,950
really bad stuff so for example botnets

365
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,740
right we'll use IRC traffic and IRC

366
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,960
traffic is not normally encrypted

367
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,370
additionally if you're on IRC traffic

368
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,730
that's going to be anomalous and we can

369
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,729
fly that

370
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:57,360
any more questions so when do you say

371
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,310
like something anomalous happens what's

372
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,899
the process like that you start looking

373
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,790
into and whether it should be flagged or

374
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,010
not what kind of things excellent

375
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,790
question so going along with this slide

376
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,470
it is based on the telemetry we have in

377
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,389
the customers network and the rules

378
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,030
we've set in place will determine

379
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,590
whether or not traffic is anomalous and

380
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,649
that's based on negotiations with the

381
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,929
customer they'll say this is the network

382
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,120
we have this is what we define as

383
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,180
anomalous and we'll write rules the flag

384
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,439
it and then for example if we have a

385
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,030
customer that's got two separate

386
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,790
networks for example Purdue has a guest

387
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,550
network and a production production

388
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,530
Network the guest network will be looked

389
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,490
at differently than the production

390
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,100
Network and will have different rules

391
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,510
fight against it and certain customers

392
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,830
Willa to make sure you hold your mind

393
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:49,140
got it thank you well also for example

394
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,659
on the guest network the customer might

395
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,430
tell us to use less rules because it's

396
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,380
the guest network their disappearing

397
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,360
certain things that happen on it or to

398
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,820
ignore certain events whereas on a

399
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,899
production at work they're going to say

400
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,560
we don't want to see any traffic to

401
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,210
Facebook that Facebook will be flagged

402
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,570
as anomalous traffic and that's because

403
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,460
the customer wants it flagged as such so

404
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,689
it's ultimately up to the customer

405
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,050
determine what's anomalous and what

406
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,180
isn't aside from the obvious oh this is

407
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,430
bot met traffic or this is ransomware

408
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,620
traffic we do send out reports and let

409
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,110
them know what's out there so they can

410
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,459
be aware but certain networks just don't

411
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,260
block certain things so they have to

412
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,560
have them open mmm no problem any other

413
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,560
questions

414
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,530
so when you say you work to all those

415
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,060
pcap files it it's both motorized

416
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,610
traffic so we may as well as outgoing

417
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,260
right we look at pcap traffic that's not

418
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,159
only inbound and outgoing but also look

419
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,800
at inter network traffic so you'll have

420
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,910
networks within the company that are

421
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,129
communicating with each other and we

422
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,350
also look at that and that's defined as

423
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,410
north-south and east-west traffic north

424
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,679
south is outbound to the internet or

425
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,760
something external to the network

426
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,120
east-west traffic is internal to the

427
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,780
network so we'll watch both north-south

428
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,649
and east-west traffic to see oh this is

429
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,820
going to a weird website or hey this

430
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,230
computer looks like it's trying to

431
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,230
infect another computer on its network

432
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,590
anymore it's good question good question

433
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,120
okay so from the slide you can see are

434
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,220
different methods of telemetry and Intel

435
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,870
which are basically the ones that I went

436
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,040
over earlier so we'll have our ATA

437
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:51,199
sensors are Cisco products the internal

438
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,480
events so things that get flagged by

439
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,140
their firewalls things that get flagged

440
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,540
by the pieces of hardware we install

441
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,090
which is the job of integration they'll

442
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,649
actually go out and stick server units

443
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,610
in the customers network to help guard

444
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:10,610
it and then all this will be ingested

445
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,199
stored searched basically we're parsing

446
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,159
the data in order to make it readable

447
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,020
because if you send terabytes of data at

448
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,440
the analyst they're just going to think

449
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,540
I have no time to do this No so we have

450
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,920
to actually parse it at least somewhat

451
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,420
and we use different tools that will

452
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,450
actually crunch the data and parse into

453
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,310
something readable our favorite tool is

454
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,490
of course Wireshark where I shark is

455
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:41,770
awesome and then our analytic functions

456
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,570
would be hunts deterministic analyses

457
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,920
parson normalize it which is all just

458
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,770
fancy terms to say we have people that

459
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,040
sit there and watch the data

460
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:53,590
once in place so what a hunt and a play

461
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,540
our is completely different for what we

462
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,340
do on a normal day and by normal day I

463
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,690
mean we sit watch traffic so what

464
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,270
normally will happen is something

465
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,920
happens on the customer Network our

466
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,680
devices flag it and send us a ticket and

467
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,530
we'll look at the ticket will parse it

468
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,390
will go through it tell the customer yes

469
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,350
this is bad fix it or no this isn't bad

470
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:17,770
ignore it what a hunt is are things that

471
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,090
we know are either not being caught by

472
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,629
our device something we just learned

473
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,699
from Intel or something that we're

474
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,530
getting kind of sparse readings on and

475
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,510
we'll go and actively look in the

476
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,010
customer Network for it we'll go pull

477
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,379
down their peak apps will go through

478
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,810
their data look for indicators

479
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,180
compromise and we're going out of our

480
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:41,710
way to go and try to find these things

481
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:45,250
for them in a play is for example email

482
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,970
so email campaigns I don't know if you

483
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:51,430
guys are familiar with fishing campaigns

484
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,160
where people try to get in with a fake

485
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:57,450
email or what have you we'll go looking

486
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,150
for those will also get emails where

487
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,010
people in the company have been emailed

488
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,300
bad files their ransom where they've

489
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,730
been emailed them and they get flagged

490
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:15,040
so we'll go through those there's our

491
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:17,350
email place or security operations so it

492
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:21,190
all focuses around our sock which we

493
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,719
have our primary sock is in RTP in North

494
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,290
Carolina we just opened one and crack

495
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,370
out Poland I actually do a one-on-one

496
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:33,040
with our sake and Japan and we had one

497
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,110
in Australia I think that one got shut

498
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,730
down and I believe we're gonna set up

499
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,340
we're gonna set up something in England

500
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:44,430
I know we just we just acquired probably

501
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:46,659
yeah we just acquired poor call us so

502
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:51,490
something is it something is coming for

503
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,860
them yes what is a sock because I don't

504
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,840
think it's a system-on-a-chip correct

505
00:24:53,860 --> 00:25:00,209
our stock is our security operations

506
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,209
center so think of those kind of

507
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:07,939
think of Star Wars and you have the

508
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,860
captain's room right where everyone's on

509
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,169
the bridge on the bridge everyone has

510
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:15,620
their assigned duties captain has what

511
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:17,779
he needs up on the screen and you take

512
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,340
your commands as needed everyone's a

513
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:20,929
colleague of course and everyone talks

514
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,320
to each other but sometimes they come in

515
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,270
and it's like this that this that move

516
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,730
so it's a security operations center and

517
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,289
that's exactly how it operates how how

518
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,450
ours is divided is will have we have

519
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:33,950
three different ranks of people we have

520
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,460
tier 1 analysts to your tune analyst and

521
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,590
investigators each tier being a build

522
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,200
upon the next one so tier 1 is the

523
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,908
baseline that's what I am I'm the first

524
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,730
line of defense i find something

525
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,770
anomalous where I think hey this this is

526
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,279
bad and I think it made on the customer

527
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,559
Network I give it to tier 2 tier 2 guy

528
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,950
gets the file blows it up verifies that

529
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,570
it's bad says okay yeah it's bad and it

530
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,860
got downloaded so he bumps in for the

531
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,080
investigator and investigators the one

532
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,020
who does the reverse engineering the

533
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,460
malware he's the guy who says yes this

534
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,450
is on the customer Network yes it's

535
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,580
dialing out I'm sending them a ticket so

536
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,100
our investigators are basically the

537
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,490
captains of the sock they're the ones

538
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,370
who ultimately hold the power and well

539
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,260
we have at least one per shift and

540
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:27,229
that's part of what makes our security

541
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,230
operations center and by extension ra ta

542
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,210
very very likeable to our customers is

543
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,890
we have 24 hour seven days a week

544
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,399
someone is watching their network

545
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:39,710
absolutely and there's always an

546
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:43,070
investigator on shift so there's always

547
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,830
somebody in the captain's chair I have a

548
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,678
question could you resolve the situation

549
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,678
when the employee leaks some sensitive

550
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,740
corporate data how can you distinguish

551
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,679
does the employees and advertisement

552
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,110
sheet or it's some sensitive spec for

553
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,720
the product to have some machine

554
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,520
learning model maybe are you looking in

555
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,899
regards to protecting someone else's

556
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:12,250
data or internally for example corporate

557
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:12,250
employees since out

558
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:26,059
Mike's so like an accident so like an

559
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,550
accidental release of information there

560
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:34,370
was a more maliciously so either way to

561
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:37,940
see if you can detect it if we consider

562
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:39,830
complicated case it's encrypted so

563
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,050
employee encrypted something you don't

564
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,780
know what is inside and it went to some

565
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,700
unknown email address there are various

566
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,340
ways to detect that type of information

567
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,800
based on each agency and what their

568
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,629
rules and regulations are so for each

569
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,040
event we would have that in a statement

570
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,440
of work and we would have an agreement

571
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,760
to be able to do certain things but

572
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,290
there are various types of tools that

573
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,590
can be utilized to find that information

574
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:07,070
down to a file hash what's also

575
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,750
interesting is where I'm describing to

576
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,730
you our advanced threat analytics for

577
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,350
external customers there's an internal

578
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,270
version to Cisco specifically that is

579
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,830
also watching our traffic correct so

580
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,809
they'll notice oh if we're sending

581
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,370
something encrypted out to something

582
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,510
that probably shouldn't be communicated

583
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:26,899
to they're gonna flag and let our

584
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:29,870
managers now I wonder do you use any

585
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,360
machine learning model because it's hard

586
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,340
to check each email who sent what it's

587
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,399
in the pipeline we are working

588
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,540
proprietary that's that's really all I

589
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:44,240
can say about is that we're working on

590
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:49,070
it any other questions removal good

591
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:53,059
question so our event correlation

592
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:57,790
analysis we identify suspicious patterns

593
00:28:53,059 --> 00:29:00,678
in data flow which could be as much as

594
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,879
someone just says hey this is something

595
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,660
we see often enough let's write

596
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,670
something for it that detects it too hey

597
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,280
this IP address is coming up often

598
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,350
enough let's let's do a hunt to see if

599
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,639
we can find that more and it ends up

600
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,709
being something that's a camp that's

601
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,240
part of a campaign pretty much

602
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,830
everything we just walked through prior

603
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,310
to coming through this with the various

604
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,928
different levels of interaction between

605
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,470
the analysts and and what they're doing

606
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,620
with their work

607
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:32,800
we also will have analysis using our

608
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:37,239
vulnerability correlation so sis logs

609
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:45,250
data logs DNS logs we have lots and lots

610
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:49,270
of logs that we go digging through that

611
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:52,270
backward there we go so we also have our

612
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:56,170
indirect net flow analysis so we will

613
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:58,180
leverage net flow to export excuse me

614
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,530
leverage Cisco's netflow feature

615
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,040
exported by network and security

616
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,960
applications so basically one that some

617
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:09,060
eise's as we're going to look at the

618
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,160
data or just exporting it so

619
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,960
deterministic rules base are the snort

620
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,850
rules I was talking about earlier where

621
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,980
we'll apply a rule on the preprocessor

622
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:21,129
data we'll hit it and it will flag yes

623
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,500
or no did it trip the role our

624
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:27,180
statistical analysis would be do we see

625
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:31,120
anomalous DNS traffic so that could be

626
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,500
traffic to a DNS server that a company

627
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,899
or corporation has never used before and

628
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,050
we'll see that over the course of days

629
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,210
or weeks we'll also have our heuristic

630
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:44,610
analysis so we look at a bunch of data

631
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:49,210
it's a big big data the buzzword it is

632
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:53,050
there's your zero day was on that slide

633
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,450
yep data science analysis same thing big

634
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,470
data and we're basically just crunching

635
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,240
through to see patterns and anomalous

636
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:08,110
indicators compromise that's a very

637
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:09,340
intense analysis there and then there's

638
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,969
your machine learning this is our

639
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,639
machine learning we also use tons of

640
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,050
metadata and for our essentials

641
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,180
customers we actually have no access to

642
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,460
pcap we have none of their packet

643
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,980
captures we only have the metadata and

644
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,960
yet we still have to make calls on it so

645
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,940
getting used to not having the pcap and

646
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,090
just seeing the metadata for example

647
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,600
where was the original where was it

648
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,280
going and is where it's going something

649
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,050
in almost to the customer so is this oh

650
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,020
it's a business part

651
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:44,470
in Europe or is this some weird IP in

652
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:52,360
China so that in automatically you can

653
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:54,010
say hey yeah this is bad so event

654
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,469
correlation yeah so our event

655
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:03,370
correlation inbound SQL slammer which is

656
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:04,960
a variant of an ex boy where well we

657
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,800
have the target IP address the port

658
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,980
source IP address and geolocation so we

659
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,879
know this metadata we can flag it as an

660
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:26,190
ominous that make sense I see I see how

661
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:26,190
you're in the data it's good questions

662
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:39,709
went back with you hi go backwards hmm

663
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:42,529
netflow so our net flow is captured by

664
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,940
devices captured from devices by

665
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,650
centralized network collectors such as

666
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,750
stealthWatch so basically it's

667
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,350
corroborating all the data together in a

668
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:53,990
single packet so we can look at it and

669
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,908
analyze it for anomalies so this could

670
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,580
be getting all the DNS traffic together

671
00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:04,220
in one so we can look at it as a whole

672
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:10,129
versus individual DNS servers syslog

673
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:12,590
message parsing yeah simple enough where

674
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,730
we're given the syslog and we're giving

675
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,299
the messages and we look to see if

676
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:19,850
there's anything in them that are odd

677
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:23,270
how do you deal with the sampling

678
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:25,879
wouldn't that flow data it's not really

679
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,799
a full pack packet capture right its

680
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,799
metadata so we deal with the same way

681
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,080
but it's also same hold true and it

682
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,730
ultimately will end up dealing with how

683
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,100
the customer wants us to handle it a lot

684
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,299
of the customers will like for

685
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,100
essentials we don't get this log data

686
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,750
for the premier we get syslog data and

687
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,820
then based on the syslog data they'll

688
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:47,950
have us do specific things with it so

689
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,950
for example if we know that there is

690
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,879
data to specific like IP address that we

691
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,380
know is bad that's flagged so it'll be

692
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,779
flagged and we can corroborate it with

693
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,860
the syslog data and see oh there are

694
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,110
some machines in our network that are

695
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,029
dialing out to that so what data are you

696
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,029
referring to is there something in

697
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:10,099
addition to well no they I mean that

698
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,260
flows sampled so I mean that's a that's

699
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,320
a pretty basic case okay I have a

700
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,419
malicious IP but you're not really doing

701
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,040
anomalous I mean anomalous detection is

702
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:22,399
very difficult when you're look when you

703
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,080
don't have when it's sampled data right

704
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,409
because you're not really understanding

705
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:31,219
the communication so you can't take like

706
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:34,040
statistical deviations of that like it's

707
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:38,509
sampled so I'm asking how you know you

708
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,699
had a chart that was characterizing you

709
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,950
know this is a particular worm or

710
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,509
whatever but that's all sampled data so

711
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,850
that's the

712
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,649
a lot of context to that it isn't really

713
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,929
I mean that's kind of like fall

714
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:52,000
statistics right there right leak so

715
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,929
think of it more like I've worked with

716
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,889
net flow for a decade so okay so I

717
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,310
personally haven't done any of the net

718
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:02,500
flow stuff the closest thing that I got

719
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,750
to doing with it was working on a

720
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,840
project with DNS data and we took a

721
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,490
year's worth of DNS data from a customer

722
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,710
so terabytes and terabytes of

723
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,660
information and this customer we knew

724
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,450
how to breach so we were trying to

725
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,049
corroborate the data saying oh ok so do

726
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,700
we see some anomalous DNS traffic we did

727
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,190
but the the trouble was getting the data

728
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,020
to sit instead of just having a hunch

729
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,800
where we could just say bye I this is

730
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:34,950
weird trying to actually get the data to

731
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:40,300
prove that's what it was so yes it's

732
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:41,560
totally about context interesting i'd

733
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,640
like to have an offline discussion

734
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,520
that's good yeah we do that machine

735
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:52,000
learning queries which that's definitely

736
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,150
in the work I have not actually gotten

737
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,350
to work with it too much so our

738
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:02,850
proactive customization which we look at

739
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:06,520
all the big security contenders McAfee

740
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:09,069
kaspersky all of them and get together

741
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,410
and buy get together I mean they'll say

742
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,520
what what bad stuff happened at what

743
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:19,180
time and the security community is very

744
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,950
tight-knit so if Facebook find something

745
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,839
want some anomaly or vulnerability

746
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,279
they're going to share it so we're

747
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,530
watching that if we find something we'll

748
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,870
share it so it's basically updating all

749
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,610
of our tools with whatever everyone else

750
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,859
is found so that you can find all the

751
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,920
newest threats so very quickly we're

752
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,690
going to run through 80 a threat hunting

753
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,320
here's the cyber kill chain it's due to

754
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:44,200
the amount of time that we have 20 years

755
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,940
late and so the cyber kill chain is

756
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,569
basically the steps that malware goes

757
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:52,780
through in order to basically get your

758
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,600
machine and it will be from the

759
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,250
basically all the way from hitting your

760
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:01,630
machine and looking at it too

761
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:03,690
finally exfiltrating data so right here

762
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:07,000
is the cyber kill chain recon lure

763
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,760
redirect the exploit kit dropper files

764
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,380
the call home and finally the data theft

765
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:19,240
which is the exfiltration so we try our

766
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,190
goal is to try to hit this as early in

767
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,720
the chain as we can the earlier in the

768
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,040
chain you can hit it the better off you

769
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:32,379
are absolutely so our management cycle

770
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,330
is reactive in and in my opinion that's

771
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,610
unfortunate but that has to deal with

772
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,000
the nature of the of the business we

773
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:42,010
have to be reactive absolutely so

774
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,350
they're also as proactive as well right

775
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,830
it's just you can get in trouble if you

776
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:50,680
do Proactiv to proactively and it's

777
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:53,020
catered per each client so each Network

778
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,399
each in infrastructure they have their

779
00:37:53,020 --> 00:38:01,090
own types of security policies that they

780
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,010
deal with in different various agencies

781
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,330
that they also get compliance from so

782
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:08,040
they have different things that they do

783
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:11,980
so we have to comply to that for them

784
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,050
some attacks and attend detection so

785
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,210
angler exploit kit how many of you guys

786
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,350
are familiar with well let me ask that

787
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,110
first question how many of you familiar

788
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,480
with an exploit kit all right awesome

789
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,590
that's more than I thought so for those

790
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,900
of you who don't know what an exploit

791
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:30,000
kit is it's basically software that's

792
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,310
tailored to a certain exploit so in

793
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,520
Adobe if there is a certain exploit a

794
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,799
kit will be created to use it and the

795
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,650
purpose of the exploit kit is to use the

796
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,490
exploit to put bed software on whatever

797
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,960
is running it so anglers kind of died

798
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:52,120
out because a lot of the people that

799
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:55,870
wrote it have been caught dire banking

800
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,420
malware so it's basically hooks into the

801
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,850
browser to steal your de steal

802
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,600
credentials so you you're typing to

803
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,980
browser and after gates which is the

804
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,089
scariest kind of malware is the kind of

805
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,020
problem exactly so tell us reverse

806
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,450
engineered it

807
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:21,490
up there is basically its functionality

808
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:23,850
in a flow chart so taluses also created

809
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:27,790
new detection methods to analyze

810
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:37,839
basically the indicators to compromise

811
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:39,490
for it thank you so the different type

812
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,070
of interfaces that are utilized for an

813
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,959
analyst to do their searches and

814
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:47,290
investigations once they start at the

815
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,640
initial triage of an incident here is

816
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,779
the advanced threat analytics threat

817
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:58,600
detection example for dried X shows you

818
00:39:52,780 --> 00:40:00,670
the decap correlation and analysis so

819
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,080
then we also have for examples like

820
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,180
right here it's got our elasticsearch

821
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,120
got our packet capture and our metadata

822
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,759
ground which is through bro and net flow

823
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:15,970
generation so more on the example for

824
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,830
droid x where it's being flagged by the

825
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,689
IP address that's what ultimately gets

826
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:23,680
flagged right and then once the

827
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,180
connection was observed the

828
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,669
investigators search for correlating

829
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,040
events so basically our Tier one says

830
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,170
this is a known bad IP our tier 2 said

831
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,910
this is definitely giving out bad stuff

832
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,620
and our investigator finally says

833
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,240
alright let's go hunting for it on their

834
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,900
network so we were hoping that we could

835
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:43,419
walk you through a different a detailed

836
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,150
investigation with an and analyst and

837
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,550
what they do with a TA on some of the

838
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,930
things that they're analyzing and this

839
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:56,410
is to show you some of the information

840
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:58,480
that they'll see right so the servers

841
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,890
located in Russia generally are two

842
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,420
known Bad's is if we see companies

843
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,890
communicating in Russia or China and

844
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,230
they explicitly you told us we don't

845
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:09,700
deal in China or Russia that's bad

846
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,760
server give a post so we know it's to

847
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,850
live then here we'll have the packet cap

848
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,270
part of the packet capture so they can

849
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:21,460
it was obfuscated it so it makes it very

850
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,040
hard for human eyes to read mine in work

851
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,610
so we try to write programs that'll help

852
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,330
the office

853
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:30,070
the code so Java codes very very common

854
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:37,870
that's the code that was found that was

855
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:42,520
buried and everything this is how we

856
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:45,490
ultimately will sanitize it so to make

857
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,690
sure that insert person from company

858
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,540
here doesn't accidentally click on the

859
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:51,190
bad link and get it will sanitize it

860
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,990
like so take a picture of a picture of

861
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:59,350
another picture and insert it towards

862
00:41:52,990 --> 00:42:02,040
non touchable here's a where it was

863
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:05,799
downloaded so temp directory as this D

864
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:10,000
SHhhh see so we were able to actually

865
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,340
say we're got downloaded and it was

866
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,020
flagged as malware by seven out of 57

867
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,920
programs so we definitely let them know

868
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:20,070
about it so I know we were short on time

869
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,660
and we walked you through some of the

870
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,490
integral steps that are taken when

871
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,040
someone is looking at particular

872
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,419
information for a compromise on anyone's

873
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,000
network especially with any of our

874
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:35,080
clientele does anyone have any questions

875
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,190
thoughts concerns we're going to be here

876
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,270
after so if you have time to stay we can

877
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:47,380
answer questions that weren't answered

878
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:50,190
during broadcast absolutely okay thank

879
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,190
you thank you

880
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,270
you
