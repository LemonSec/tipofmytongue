1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:12,129
how are you all doing so fatigued from

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,679
sitting around for two days probably

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,009
setting in for some of you I know it did

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,220
for me a little bit earlier but we're to

5
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:23,980
the last of the sessions for the 17th

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,640
Syria symposium and we're saving one of

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,369
the best for last year if you were here

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,340
Monday you got to hear a first talk from

9
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:37,540
our next speaker and you may have heard

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:41,650
him at some other venues a very unique

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:46,559
perspective uh Richard George the Dickie

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:50,080
to most people has spent 41 years

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:54,659
working for the National Security Agency

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,199
in a number of roles principally in

15
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,909
areas related to cryptography and

16
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,650
related kinds of things he spent the

17
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:06,729
last eight years of his career there you

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:09,340
retired in with it 2011 so we retired in

19
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:14,310
2011 after 41 years and is finally years

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:18,130
he spent as technical director for the

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:24,760
Internet assurance Directorate I ad

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:26,710
where he had a role to advise a number

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,460
of people within the agency about

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,169
technical issues in for cyber and that

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,750
brought him into contact with a number

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:39,820
of different technologies and people i

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:42,220
met him some time ago and it's it's

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,589
always been entertaining to have

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,100
conversations with him to hear some of

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,070
his stories and we're going to close out

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,429
this series symposium with some

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:58,210
reflections on life as a target by

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,070
Dickey George students who are signed up

34
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,658
for the serious seminar make sure that

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,279
you sign the attendance sheet in the

36
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:09,310
back so that you get credit for this

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,869
lecture thanks very much so all is fun

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,310
to talk about history particularly when

39
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:17,230
you're my age you've got so much to talk

40
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:20,230
about so um back in 2007

41
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,379
it was asked to come and speak on a

42
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,119
panel at Georgia Tech and the panel's

43
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,679
the topic of the panel was emerging

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,599
threats in cyberspace and I was the

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,580
gummy guy so I was the last guy to talk

46
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,929
and they had a bunch of CTOs that were

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,690
talking about all this terrible stuff

48
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,430
that was starting to happen it occurred

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,220
to me that had really been happening for

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,819
about 30 years just not to them been

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,950
happening to us in the government so I

52
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:50,260
figured you know it's worthwhile to go

53
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,440
back and explain to people that they're

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,780
not really emerging threats so much as

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,459
there are emerging targets the target

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,760
space is changing not the threat space

57
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:04,930
so much so that's that's where this

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,780
thing comes from information assurance

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,000
which which we talk about it really

60
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,489
started as commsec communications

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,660
security or 50 infosec information

62
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,950
security when you realized it wasn't the

63
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,959
communications as much as the

64
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,548
information we're worried about then it

65
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,420
became information assurance when we

66
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,950
realize we weren't really getting

67
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,500
security and now it's not it's not the

68
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,730
same kind of information assurance as it

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,440
used to be because you're no longer

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,940
worried just about the information but

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,579
you're worried about what that

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,620
information could do the physical damage

73
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,680
that could because so the game keeps

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,030
changing around us it doesn't mean we

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,190
don't have to address it in the same way

76
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,639
but it but it does mean we have to worry

77
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,829
about different kinds of impacts so I'm

78
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,720
going to start by talking about you know

79
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:54,190
back when I was back when I was really

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:57,400
young I used to go down to the the big

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,790
city near our little town about once a

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,190
week and stand on the top of an office

83
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,798
building and watch for Russian planes

84
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,540
that were coming overhead that was

85
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,260
really boring because we never never

86
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,910
actually saw any then man then I got old

87
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,089
enough that I went to elementary school

88
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,120
and about once a month an alarm would go

89
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,518
off and we would all dive under our

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,500
desks under those wooden desks because

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,330
that was what we would do if the

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,060
Russians were dropping an atomic bomb on

93
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,060
our school now

94
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,599
yeah we all did it and about half of us

95
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,210
when we went home we had bomb shelters

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,930
in the basement in fact we cleaned out

97
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,419
my parents house in about 10 years ago

98
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,490
we found all the stuff that was there

99
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,830
although all the food and the blankets

100
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,050
but that bomb shelter was still a bomb

101
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,310
shelter the food was probably not edible

102
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,470
it's the old but so there's an

103
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,979
interesting thing about that and what's

104
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,849
interesting about that is we understood

105
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,930
what the threat was certainly my parents

106
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,719
did they had made it through World War

107
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,210
two both but the concept of bombing was

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,710
very real to that generation and they

109
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,000
transferred that realization to us so we

110
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,409
understood the threat we understood the

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,509
risk the government provided information

112
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,400
they told us get under the desk they

113
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,050
told us if you build a bomb shelter this

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,698
is the kind of cement you need this is

115
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,570
what you need to store they were

116
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,510
providing real guidance as to how we

117
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,940
should react to that threat and they

118
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,880
were assuring us that they were building

119
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,260
a defense deterrence so that we didn't

120
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,300
really have to worry about this

121
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,120
happening that they were taking steps to

122
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,919
protect us from this event so keep that

123
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,409
in mind because that was the response

124
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,289
that the government was taking they were

125
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:59,680
taking a very very active response both

126
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,659
in preparing us and protecting us that

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,720
was an important thing they did now when

128
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:08,139
you think about the Cold War it was

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,460
really good times the there were only

130
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:16,360
two aspects to the Cold War one was

131
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,979
espionage and one was the technology

132
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,409
race that was kind of split into two

133
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,599
pieces it was nuclear weapons and it was

134
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,490
the race for space I can remember

135
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,800
standing out he was nineteen fifty-seven

136
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,500
standing out in my backyard and watching

137
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,680
spudnick go overhead and that was a

138
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,060
fantastic thing it was really excited to

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,840
see that happen to think that we could

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,099
actually do that pretty cool the world

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,888
has changed there's a lot of junk up

142
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,430
there now nobody nobody bothers to stop

143
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:48,860
and look for it

144
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:53,000
it's just yeah we all know it's there so

145
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:56,150
so keep in mind that's changed now the

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,910
the nice part about the Espionage was it

147
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:02,450
was a really clean game when i started

148
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,100
at NSA my first day at NSA young kid we

149
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:08,000
were sitting in a room about 30 young

150
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,760
kids there was an old guy in the back he

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,630
was probably about 35 but but to us he

152
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,360
was old and the second day he got up to

153
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:21,380
talk at the end of the day he said so I

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,150
want you all to know that you've you've

155
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,080
walked through that door you've got a

156
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,700
badge you're now a target you have to

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,039
assume the Russians know who you are

158
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,039
they have a folder on you they are

159
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,240
looking for you to make a mistake they

160
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,100
will take advantage of that mistake if

161
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,210
you don't make a mistake you're safe but

162
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,220
they're looking for you to take a risk

163
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,549
that they can take advantage of he said

164
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,470
for example if you're in a bar and

165
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,290
there's a good-looking guy good-looking

166
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:56,030
girl walks up to you and seems

167
00:07:51,290 --> 00:08:00,040
interested in you be careful I spent two

168
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,039
days with you and you're not interesting

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,260
now that I didn't like that so I went

170
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,870
home I told my wife just yeah yeah I

171
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:14,210
know your friends he's right they are

172
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:19,430
very patient they will wait for you to

173
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:22,150
make a mistake when you do be ready so

174
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,880
that's that's that's is a very fair game

175
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,219
because I was a player I put on that

176
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,030
badge I walked through that door I knew

177
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:36,650
that I was accepting that and I would be

178
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:38,659
a target that's fine in addition to that

179
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,780
I know as long as I play by the rules

180
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,339
I'm perfectly safe it's not like

181
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,079
someone's going to come knocking on my

182
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,870
door with a gun because that's against

183
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,790
the rules they were waitin waitin for me

184
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,860
to make a mistake so think about your

185
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,240
thread adversary model there are six

186
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,899
pieces to a thread adversary model

187
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,100
and there they pair up a little bit

188
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,370
capabilities and resources those are the

189
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,290
first two what is your adversary capable

190
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,500
of doing and what do they have the

191
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,000
resources to do they might be capable of

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,680
doing all sorts of things but what can

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,990
they afford to do and what's it worth

194
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,550
while to them to do you have to

195
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,649
understand that before you try to any

196
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,810
kind of security you got to realize what

197
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,880
the threat is what you're worried about

198
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,500
protecting yourself against and then

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,649
spend appropriately to protect yourself

200
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,600
so that's really important to understand

201
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:33,779
understand your adversary capabilities

202
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,020
in the resources second pieces intent

203
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,550
and motivations slightly different what

204
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:43,110
do they want to do why do they want to

205
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:46,170
do it so back then it was very simple we

206
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,600
were a target because the Russians were

207
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,270
interested in strategic government

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,760
information really nice really clean

209
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:00,060
very very simple game they wanted to

210
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,140
know what we were thinking the last two

211
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,599
pieces risk aversion how much risk are

212
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,839
they willing to take to get that piece

213
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,399
of information what kind of access do

214
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,010
they have so if you think of those times

215
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,920
that was a really nice way to put it now

216
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:23,250
the access might be a person in a bar

217
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,010
there's there's a lot of risk because if

218
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,950
someone approaches you and you recognize

219
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,410
that you're being approached he's blown

220
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,750
his chance he's probably going to be

221
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,709
thrown out of the country so they have

222
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,660
to be pretty darn careful a lot of risk

223
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:42,469
access is hard it's one-on-one you got

224
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,770
to find that guy take advantage of them

225
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,990
really interesting game so let's think

226
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,579
about what security was like I'm going

227
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,770
to throw out an example of vinson which

228
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,260
I talked about a little bit last time I

229
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,240
talked vinson was a handheld radio

230
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:04,980
pretty cool the crypto was designed in

231
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,720
1957 so we studied it for about 12 years

232
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,930
till we were pretty sure it was pretty

233
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,610
darn good then we started building him

234
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,329
and we worked really hard to build it

235
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:21,190
right we fielded it in 1976 so took 19

236
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:22,450
years so now the neat thing was the game

237
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,930
was still pretty much the same it was

238
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,730
first to market would win but of course

239
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,640
nobody else was in the race so we were

240
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,260
always first to market and we always won

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,120
and in fact that it took 19 years that's

242
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:41,020
okay because we built it really well

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:47,550
still out there no changes that's a long

244
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:50,980
time something like 40 years no changes

245
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,990
how hard do we look at that well when

246
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,790
you're looking at a crypto device

247
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,560
something like that you uh you have to

248
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,800
understand that you don't need to know

249
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,790
what it's supposed to do because if it's

250
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,339
doing what it's supposed to do it's

251
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,140
probably good you need to know what you

252
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,149
can make it do what you can get it to do

253
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,550
that nobody else thinks it's going to do

254
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:12,700
and so when we were looking at that

255
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,439
Vincent I spent six months with the

256
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,190
engineering diagrams of that thing going

257
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,190
through it looking at every line every

258
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,550
every gate every every register stage

259
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,310
trying to figure out what could go wrong

260
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,829
what could I take advantage of yeah I

261
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,819
can still see those those diagrams in my

262
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,709
mind that's that's the kind of analysis

263
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,410
you can do on a simple device like that

264
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:41,619
because we built that thing for one

265
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,990
purpose we defined exactly the

266
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,540
functionality we wanted to have for that

267
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,410
purpose and we built that functionality

268
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,750
in and no other functionality it could

269
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,490
only do what we wanted it to do it's not

270
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,980
like today's world where you get a

271
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,260
general solution with tons of

272
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,000
functionality that you never used every

273
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,100
bit of that additional functionality is

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,940
opportunity for the adversary to exploit

275
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,620
you and the adversary will take

276
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,930
advantage of that if you give them that

277
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,020
opportunity you have to limit the

278
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,760
functionality as much as you can

279
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,430
critical and that that's what we did

280
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,760
back then and I think we did it pretty

281
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,120
well times have changed no longer

282
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,120
competitive

283
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,550
so I talked about Vince a little bit let

284
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,518
me talk about one other thing this is

285
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,079
kind of interesting so I i have a friend

286
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,000
did I get together with about once a

287
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,000
month we yeah we go to a local

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,100
restaurant and have a Maryland crab cake

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,980
we talk about two things we talked about

290
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,160
how good Maryland crab cakes are they

291
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,890
really are good and we and we talked

292
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,410
about how good it was in the old days I

293
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,060
might the friends have it's a victor

294
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,589
shame off I don't know if you've heard

295
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,939
of him or not he was the director of

296
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:03,040
information assurance back in the 70s

297
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,180
back in the good old days he was

298
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,439
director of information assurance for

299
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:16,420
the KGB so so he came over here in 1980

300
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,370
and it's really fun to talk to him and

301
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,360
you know we don't we don't talk business

302
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,490
because neither one really remembers

303
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,769
business but we talk about how fun it

304
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,209
was and how much we talked about how

305
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,990
much we trust each other because he

306
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,579
understood that intent and motivation in

307
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,310
fact one day I'm sitting there chewing

308
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:37,029
tune on a crab cake and Victor's talking

309
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,829
he says I need to talk to you look and I

310
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,120
said there's you know there's only two

311
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:45,520
of us at this table go ahead I'm

312
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,370
listening and he's in dumb I had

313
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,430
relations with China much like you have

314
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:55,000
with the UK we were we were friends we

315
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,399
were partners I had I had a person who

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,120
was working with them and he came to me

317
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:04,839
one day and he said Victor I don't

318
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,910
really understand them but I don't trust

319
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,449
them I don't want you to trust them

320
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,149
either and so he reached over very

321
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,060
seriously took my army said I want you

322
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,860
to understand you can't trust them so

323
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,569
I'm sitting there in a restaurant with

324
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,860
the KGB guy told me I can't trust

325
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,390
Chinese intelligence now I kind of think

326
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,700
I knew that

327
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:34,830
but that's okay it was reassuring to

328
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:37,650
know that I was on the right track it's

329
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,680
a it's an interesting world you know one

330
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:43,590
time we used to have people that would

331
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,939
go to Moscow because you know we NSA we

332
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,790
had things to do over there it was there

333
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,620
were clean things we we went and we

334
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,660
checked out the crypto in the embassy to

335
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,420
make sure was working right things like

336
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,949
that but whenever they went over there

337
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,510
they would go over advertised his NSA

338
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,060
completely aboveboard we knew what they

339
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,830
were doing and the only rooms were

340
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,380
available we're on the seventh floor of

341
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:11,820
one particular hotel so we knew who was

342
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:18,720
on the sixth floor who was on the eighth

343
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:20,940
floor and it was not the UK so one time

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,710
we sent a team over and it was a little

345
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,150
bigger than we usually sent and there

346
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,860
were not enough rooms on the seventh

347
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,640
floor one of the guys got a room on the

348
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,490
fifth floor so what what do you think

349
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,840
that people did they ran down to the

350
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,280
fifth floor to see what the remote like

351
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,800
how different it was from the seventh

352
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,600
floor so they've been talking from

353
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,930
looking it over for about five minutes

354
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
and there was a knock on the door there

355
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,479
was a guy from the front desk at the

356
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,740
hotel he said I brought you a copying

357
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,330
machine case you want to make copies of

358
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:59,160
something he wilted and plugged it in

359
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:01,050
now maybe Russia's different than the US

360
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,359
but I know no one has ever brought me a

361
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,859
copying cheetah my hotel so these guys

362
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,869
were not dumb they were engineers they

363
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,349
knew what to do immediately they

364
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:16,948
unplugged it and they went on talking

365
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:20,369
and about five minutes later there's a

366
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:23,220
knock on the door it's the guy same guy

367
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:26,599
back again he said I brought you a new

368
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,600
copying machine that one's not working

369
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,928
so they they got the hint that they had

370
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,400
broken the rules by meeting in the in

371
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,570
the room on the fifth floor rather the

372
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
seventh floor and they went back up to

373
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,149
the seventh floor and all was good but

374
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,640
it's nice to know that you know it he

375
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,190
didn't yell at them he didn't charge

376
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,630
them extra yeah he just made it

377
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,850
perfectly clear that they were not

378
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:01,480
playing by the rules and they had to

379
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,980
play by the rules and that that's that's

380
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,870
very nice when you have that kind of

381
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,260
understanding with with your friendly

382
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:12,580
adversary that we do have to abide by

383
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:15,100
the rules of the game so if you think

384
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,559
back to that that's PI by splits spy

385
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,990
versus spy world what was espionage like

386
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,370
espionage was hard about once a decade

387
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,280
you have something good that would

388
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,129
happen so you go back and think of some

389
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,330
of them but by the way with Vincent when

390
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,860
we were building Vincent it was built on

391
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,409
special lines that were there were

392
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,809
people US citizens with clearances that

393
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,250
we're building it blinds weren't used

394
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,600
for other things now that doesn't

395
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,340
guarantee we didn't have a problem

396
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,100
didn't doesn't guarantee you don't have

397
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,209
any kind of a supply chain issue at all

398
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:55,330
because how many spies can you all name

399
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,030
so i can name like six maybe it's only

400
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,340
for now I used to be able to name six

401
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,168
but the one thing they all had in common

402
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:08,080
they're all US citizens with top-secret

403
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:09,669
clearances so that that's the with those

404
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,350
are the ones you want to get those the

405
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:18,700
guys you want to get so look at the

406
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:22,689
Espionage examples John Walker do you

407
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,540
remember John Walker so Walker back in

408
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:28,030
the 60s was selling crypto variables he

409
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,000
wasn't he was in the Navy he was a guy

410
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:35,200
he needed money he bought a bar the bar

411
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,270
was not making money so he kind of

412
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,980
walked into the Russian embassy and said

413
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,460
I have this stuff would you like to buy

414
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,630
it someone decided that was good stuff

415
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,630
so they bought it

416
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,340
he was selling stuff feels it's a neat

417
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,530
story if you want to read about it the

418
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:58,090
wiki page is pretty good but that was a

419
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:00,310
guy who had money problems made himself

420
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,990
available they immediately took

421
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,389
advantage of it that's the kind of thing

422
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,940
that happens so that so that's one

423
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,370
gunman are you familiar with project

424
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,230
gunman if you're not you can read about

425
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,080
that that's it's been released it's

426
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,940
pretty neat the way the way the embassy

427
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,320
worked we had a we had a vault where we

428
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,660
had crypto stuff down in the basement

429
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,830
and the information would be typed and

430
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,450
sent over and it was all good

431
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,159
everything's wonderful they also had

432
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,550
typewriters upstairs where they type the

433
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,860
stuff out before it went down there

434
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:32,770
those typewriters were somehow they just

435
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,570
had problems and of course the that

436
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,340
floor is the floor that the Russians had

437
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,230
access to like they cleaned it and stuff

438
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,929
like that and the typewriters would

439
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,520
break occasionally they would go out and

440
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,370
come back repaired and they worked fine

441
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,070
after repair there's a triangular

442
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,389
stability bar under the keyboard and

443
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,300
when they repaired them they replaced

444
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,970
that with a similar-looking triangular

445
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,919
bar with a recorder and a transmitter in

446
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:02,710
it so it would record what was being

447
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:05,410
typed and sent it out at night so that

448
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:10,120
was very successful it was it was really

449
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:11,920
really good technology so that's that's

450
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,350
the kind of thing that you have to worry

451
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,210
about that's a supply chain I don't want

452
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,709
people to think of supply chain is you

453
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,660
bought something with something in it

454
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,450
you have to it's a life cycle problem

455
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,090
design implementation maintenance even

456
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,610
destruction you've got to follow it

457
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,860
throughout the life and maintenance is a

458
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,439
very nice way to get in maintenance and

459
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,969
delivery you know see if something

460
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,820
sitting on our loading dock for three

461
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:41,980
weeks that's an opportunity for somebody

462
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:45,189
to visit it so that's the life you live

463
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:48,940
there was there was one not too long ago

464
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,710
where they they found a listening device

465
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,180
in a piece of chair rail in a state

466
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,090
department to conference room you're

467
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,580
familiar with that so there was about an

468
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,090
18 inch piece of chair rail that was

469
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,949
replay

470
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,049
with a similar looking piece of chair

471
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,779
rail had a recorder and transmitter in

472
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:07,150
it and they actually they actually found

473
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:09,450
that because there was a DC policemen

474
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,700
who saw the Russians doing something

475
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,520
very strange down on the street near the

476
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,010
State Department building and so he

477
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,289
called the FBI it turns out there was

478
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,879
there was a Russian there and he was

479
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:25,960
putting coins in the parking meter the

480
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,809
Russians don't do that they have

481
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,090
diplomatic immunity there's uh there's

482
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:32,649
one guy who has 3,000 parking tickets I

483
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,230
don't know how you get 3,000 parking

484
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:37,149
tickets he must spend his tuesdays

485
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,460
driving around looking for a policeman

486
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,289
who can give him a ticket but what they

487
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,760
saw this guy putting those in and he

488
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:44,110
called the FBI and they watched him

489
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,240
every once while the guy would turn

490
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:50,229
around it and slightly adjust a box of

491
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,880
Kleenex in the back of the car this

492
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,559
didn't seem to make much sense so they

493
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,690
went over and they found her a recording

494
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,570
device in that in that box clinics they

495
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:02,470
were they were listening in that kind of

496
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,240
stuff happens but look at you have that

497
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,100
you have the great seal remember when

498
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,340
they gave the president a seal that have

499
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,289
been carved by 3rd graders generous see

500
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,120
that thing that it's really nicely

501
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:16,510
carved it was not third graders who

502
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,639
carved that thing but it did come with

503
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,169
an additional there was there was

504
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,059
something in it that was a weight that

505
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:25,059
they had added to make it hang just

506
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:30,010
right the weight had special properties

507
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:32,889
so if you want it we have a replica of

508
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,658
it in the museum back back near the Ford

509
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:39,340
if you want to see it it's really pretty

510
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:41,500
cool very very nice so those are the

511
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,320
kind of things that happen that that's

512
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,220
what life was like back then it was hard

513
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,950
you had to be patient he had to do

514
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,750
really clever things to take advantage

515
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,409
of the world today's today's was

516
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,510
completely different it really is the

517
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:05,710
difference is started in 72 with DES

518
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:07,270
because back prior to that all of the

519
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,740
purity equipment was God's equipment

520
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,590
there were some commercial stuff like

521
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,809
Hagelin but there wasn't much and it was

522
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:18,610
really the u.s. building stuff for us in

523
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:22,629
72 when des came out that that changed

524
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,469
the game because NSA had a big lead on

525
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:29,860
the commercial world for one reason we

526
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,090
had the best problems to work on second

527
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,070
reason was we had a critical mass of

528
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,959
people working on the problems but the

529
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:39,668
key thing is to have the best problems

530
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,789
and we had we had us Krypto designs to

531
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:44,140
work on that nobody else got to see we

532
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,440
could take advantage of that and our

533
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,690
work you know we got to look at that you

534
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,179
can develop a lot of a lot of knowledge

535
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,610
of a lot of techniques by looking at

536
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:57,669
good problems that's how you develop

537
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,889
that's how you learn things we had that

538
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,659
advantage when we put des out there it

539
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,330
gave the world a good problem to look at

540
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,640
and then you know funny things happen

541
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,939
the internet happened ARPANET happened

542
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,880
first gave it gave the world of virtual

543
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,130
critical mass of people to look at that

544
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,710
problem at your information hey I

545
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:22,630
remember sitting at the dinner without a

546
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,390
schmear one time maybe 20 2011 2010

547
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,220
somewhere in their age he pulls out his

548
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,990
laptop and start showing me all the

549
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,520
correspondence from the 70s and 80s

550
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:34,529
where he was talking to people around

551
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:38,889
the world about des so he wasn't working

552
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:40,179
just just with you I his compatriot over

553
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,520
there he was he was working with people

554
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,590
around the world on these ideas and that

555
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,408
critical mass is really important now in

556
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,270
retrospect the world it really benefits

557
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,370
by having all these smart people looking

558
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:57,490
at crypto we learn a lot so this is a

559
00:25:51,370 --> 00:26:00,250
great thing life goes on it also means

560
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,100
that we get to use commercial products

561
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,110
in fact Suite B now which has you know

562
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:09,340
symmetric encryption a symmetric key

563
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:12,610
exchange signatures hashes it it is as

564
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,918
good as any sweet that anyone has

565
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,918
anywhere as far as I know

566
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,659
you can use that and you're good you're

567
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,039
good it's really good and you can use it

568
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,490
cheaply because it's sitting and

569
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:30,070
everybody's computer that that's the way

570
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,990
the world works now NSA goes out and buy

571
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,220
stuff but it's such a huge change you

572
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,410
get all that functionality all that

573
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,929
opportunity if you go back and look at

574
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:42,309
Vincent Vincent Vincent was a handheld

575
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:44,410
radio it digitized the speech and then

576
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,629
it encrypted it and send it out you talk

577
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,750
about adversaries getting into a system

578
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,770
now how do you get into a radio there's

579
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,900
nothing to get into you go in you can't

580
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:59,590
do anything its hardware it's funny

581
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,620
effect up in 73 I was sitting at my desk

582
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,480
and the director of information

583
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,350
assurance at the time stopped by instead

584
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,030
what are you working on I told him I was

585
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:14,080
working on a computer cryptographic

586
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,789
algorithm civil what's what's that so

587
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,320
well it's you know it's it's a

588
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,330
cryptographic algorithm a cryptographic

589
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,289
design that's intended to be used in

590
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,970
software he said okay I don't want you

591
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:28,900
spending more than ten percent of your

592
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:31,559
time on that because we will never trust

593
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:40,570
a computer and will never trust

594
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:42,549
cryptography and software so it took a

595
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,129
small amount of time before we did start

596
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:48,820
trusting it but it happened it was

597
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,500
inevitable but there's a big difference

598
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,289
between having a hardware radio and

599
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,900
having a software system ditcher

600
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,700
counting on you had to go through crypto

601
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,990
back in the old days you don't have to

602
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,460
anymore you go around it and those

603
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,190
opportunities of going around it that

604
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,140
really changes the game significantly if

605
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,250
you think about us in the Russians back

606
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,409
in the capabilities and resources days

607
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,240
we were the only ones back in the back

608
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,520
in the 60s and 70s we were the only ones

609
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,700
that had the resources to fire a nuclear

610
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,230
weapon at the other we were the only

611
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,370
ones that really could play the

612
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,620
Espionage game so that meant that meant

613
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,209
if something happened you knew who the

614
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,969
you could attribute it to the other

615
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,380
side that's a big difference I remember

616
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,270
I was talking to a senior guy down to

617
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:43,240
the down Tod one time and he said you

618
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:47,620
know we have nuclear weapons I said yes

619
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,299
sir he said if I see one of those cyber

620
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,250
attacks coming I may have to respond

621
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,110
with a nuclear weapon now I'm thinking

622
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,580
this guy is still thinking that cyber

623
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,899
attack is like a missile he's going to

624
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,330
see ones and zeros coming through the

625
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:03,100
air gonna follow on that came from there

626
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,379
he's gonna nail that guy so I said well

627
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,260
sir uh what do you do when it looks like

628
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:12,340
it's coming from Ohio we started looking

629
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:17,830
up I'm thinking hmm he's he wondering

630
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:20,168
why is Ohio attack in the Pentagon is he

631
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:26,529
thinking if I knew kohai out sends a

632
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:30,700
message or is he just thinking crap I

633
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:33,340
hadn't thought of that but you know we

634
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,370
thinking back on that I think it was

635
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,699
really really important the point that

636
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,678
he made that at some point in time we

637
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,130
are going to have to realize that we may

638
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:51,820
have to respond to cyber incidents with

639
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:53,380
a physical response that it was when we

640
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,029
were dealing with the Russians it was a

641
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,399
very symmetric world now aren't our

642
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,409
adversary model was really bad yeah we

643
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,989
reviewed the Russians as having the same

644
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:07,570
capabilities that we had and they didn't

645
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,090
it when I want you is it was stupid when

646
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,039
i looked around my office you know we

647
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,199
had we had 30 people and they all had

648
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:17,169
different capabilities why would I think

649
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,789
the Russian looked like me yeah so they

650
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:20,500
might have had different interests than

651
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:22,840
we had but that was the best model we

652
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,120
had in today's world nobody thinks that

653
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,209
anybody else looks like us they were all

654
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,949
different the Russians they had a

655
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,960
critical infrastructure much like ours

656
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,230
they had they had industry much like

657
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,419
ours they had the same goals they

658
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,250
weren't trying to steal our commercial

659
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:44,460
IP because they had their own they

660
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:47,769
didn't meet ours very different worlds

661
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,620
today's world some of the people that

662
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:53,200
would want to harm us don't have the

663
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,139
same kind of targets that we could

664
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,970
strike back at right we have a critical

665
00:30:56,139 --> 00:31:00,459
infrastructure a terrorist doesn't have

666
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:04,149
a critical infrastructure you can't

667
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,549
respond that way that's extremely

668
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:09,129
difficult for us to handle back in fact

669
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:10,990
back in the good old days when Victor

670
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,260
was playing defense I was playing

671
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:19,149
defense we were playing the same game

672
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:21,399
and we were very happy with that game we

673
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:25,360
understood it it was symmetric in every

674
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:27,459
sense offense was hard and it was

675
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,908
expensive defense was hard and it was

676
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,510
expensive in today's world defense is

677
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:36,760
hard and very expensive offense is easy

678
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,669
and cheap yeah we were talking earlier

679
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,710
if you capabilities and resources if you

680
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,960
aren't capable of attacking someone you

681
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,360
can rent it on the internet we were

682
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,980
talking at lunch so you can see it

683
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,229
advertising you want access to this

684
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,149
email account I'll get access for you

685
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,799
for fifty dollars that's oh that's a

686
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:56,168
little task i only charge fifty dollars

687
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,610
from little tasks medium tasks if you

688
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:00,840
want to destroy someone's life that's a

689
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,949
medium test that's two hundred dollars

690
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,678
my life is worth more than two hundred

691
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,649
dollars I don't community is at least I

692
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,159
don't want it destroyed but that's

693
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:13,539
that's the world we live in and yeah you

694
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,380
know why nobody's going after credit

695
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:19,929
cards these days markets flooded credit

696
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,669
card numbers are like a dollar and and

697
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:26,470
we're we're numb to that threat who here

698
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,240
hasn't had to change their credit card

699
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,760
number because somebody stole it yeah I

700
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,889
don't see any hint yeah it's just a way

701
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,539
of life so now they're going after

702
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:39,279
health information that's lousy because

703
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,899
it's really hard to change your health

704
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,870
you can't just order a new blood type

705
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:47,469
over the Internet stuck with what you

706
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:49,840
got and that that can be that can be bad

707
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,909
news just ransomware stuff really lousy

708
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,678
now ransom where's interesting it's a

709
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:56,490
really great example of the threat

710
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,600
adversary model because

711
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,720
adversaries will have different intent

712
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,149
and motivation yeah you know somebody

713
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,450
might go in and they might they might

714
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,299
access a hospital system because they

715
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,740
want they want to charge for ransomware

716
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,450
might be a criminal you might have a

717
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,360
disgruntled employee who just wants to

718
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,850
go in and create a problem you might

719
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,590
have a foreign nation state that wants

720
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,928
to win and plant something that doesn't

721
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,360
do anything until they tell it to and

722
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:28,630
then it happens all over the nation and

723
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,879
you've got a crisis so you have to worry

724
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,020
about the same attack having all sorts

725
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,020
of different intents and motivations

726
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:41,919
hard to defend really hard to defend

727
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,780
particularly given the discussion

728
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,730
earlier if you look at software the

729
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:53,168
industry standard is is 2250 defects per

730
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:57,549
thousand lines of code defects don't

731
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:59,710
always result in attacks but you don't

732
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:02,080
know which ones will a lot of them will

733
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,820
and you won't know until you see what

734
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,809
else is running how it's running how

735
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:10,418
it's being used it's a problem and for

736
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:13,119
big systems there's a lot of thousand

737
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,980
lines of code you might have 50 million

738
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,119
lines of code ins open it's a lot of

739
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:22,210
defects and we aren't going to find them

740
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,980
worse is discussed today earlier all the

741
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,139
commercial tools find the same families

742
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,260
of defects there are a lot of defects

743
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:31,389
that are just too complicated for

744
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,980
commercial tools to understand they may

745
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,080
even label it is there might be

746
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,730
something here but I don't know really

747
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:43,449
hard it takes people to do that and

748
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,760
that's a that's a lot of work we aren't

749
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:49,000
going to find all those defects so we're

750
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,310
going to have to live with it supply

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,290
chain some of the defects are

752
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,299
intentional those are really hard to

753
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:58,900
find when you do find him they don't

754
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:03,010
look intentional they look like so

755
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,599
somebody was was a sloppy coder if he's

756
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:09,160
really good it looks like a sloppy coder

757
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,440
and that's life that's where we are

758
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,910
now every chain every change that we

759
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,150
have these days makes life easier for us

760
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,828
and for the adversary it's really

761
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:26,530
interesting if you think about it if you

762
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:28,089
think about what was the most the the

763
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,119
biggest target the biggest the

764
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:36,578
wealthiest company in the country back

765
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:39,539
in the 50s it was General Motors what

766
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:47,339
was their their value in it was in

767
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:50,640
inventory metal machinery and plants

768
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:54,069
those are hard things to steal in bulk

769
00:35:50,640 --> 00:36:00,670
really are look at a company like Google

770
00:35:54,069 --> 00:36:04,180
today their value is in bits it's a lot

771
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:06,190
easier to steal bits that's the world we

772
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:12,399
live in where somebody can can run off

773
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:14,980
with bits and bleed you dry the value of

774
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,260
this nation is in the fact that we are

775
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:26,710
innovative creative if we lose that the

776
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:29,020
edge the IP our value is gone it's it's

777
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:32,140
a significant problem listen look look

778
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,880
it up remember we had about every every

779
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,799
decade we had an attack or so on the

780
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,970
government let's look at the 2011 and

781
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:41,309
see what kind of attacks there might

782
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:44,140
have been a US government suffered

783
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:46,089
41,000 real attacks these are not pings

784
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,700
we get 38 millions of pings a day where

785
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:51,220
people are looking but these are 41,000

786
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,279
real attacks it's a lot it's a lot of

787
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,819
real attacks not just the government RSA

788
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:59,140
RSA got hit so what were they looking

789
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:01,180
for there they were they were looking

790
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,368
for that access they were trying you

791
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,740
trying to use our essay to get access to

792
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:10,740
other people's systems they're going

793
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:13,479
after the tokens Lockheed Martin

794
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,160
Lockheed Martin they got they got hit

795
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,990
and they took a lot of information about

796
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,990
stuff they were doing for DoD

797
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,970
not just them Nasdaq what were they

798
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,560
looking at for nasdaq they were looking

799
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,620
for timing information they wanted to

800
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,060
make a lot of money on trades that they

801
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,160
were able to do before everybody else

802
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,299
was getting the information you know if

803
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,920
you can they're doing nanoseconds but if

804
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,840
you can get information out an hour

805
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,380
ahead of time on the stock market even

806
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,760
guy like me could make money so that

807
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,850
that's a game that's what you'd like to

808
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,390
do mitsubishi remember when mitsubishi

809
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:54,630
got hit more information they built

810
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:58,799
submarines not for us but other people

811
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:01,260
have submarines to DigiNotar you all

812
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,450
heard of DigiNotar that's because

813
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,090
they're no longer in business they were

814
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:09,439
a big certificate place when they got

815
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,810
hit the bad guy started issuing

816
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,360
DigiNotar certificates on whatever

817
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:18,150
whatever updates they wanted to hand out

818
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:21,780
to to fix software and they were fixing

819
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,600
it in interesting ways so if you deal in

820
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,000
certificates and you don't have people

821
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:32,069
don't trust you anymore guess what you

822
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,610
got nothing left so they're gone credit

823
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:38,880
card tax every day if you look at the

824
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:42,000
stats of what's going on mcafee so they

825
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,530
they say they get about last I heard was

826
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,790
about two hundred thousand pieces of

827
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:50,400
unique malware per day they define

828
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:54,900
unique as doesn't match a signature

829
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,660
they've got really easy to flip in fact

830
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,270
i was i was reading that last year in

831
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,270
the commercial world about eighty

832
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:06,780
percent of the attacks were targeted so

833
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:09,180
that if your adversary is is a and he's

834
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,490
attacking seven places with the same

835
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,220
attack he modifies the code so that the

836
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,450
signatures are all different timing some

837
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,209
little different behaviors a little

838
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:20,790
different so sharing that information

839
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:24,300
from from the first doesn't do the other

840
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,800
six any good makes it really hard now

841
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,000
not that we're really good at sharing

842
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:33,020
information but as we get better the

843
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,070
adversary is ready for us to get better

844
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,660
that's that's a hard problem health

845
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,160
stuff stuff that was that was the

846
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,359
biggest target last year health

847
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,180
information sorry I so uninteresting

848
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,240
stack I sit on panels occasionally there

849
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,890
theros fun I was with two professors one

850
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,020
time they were talking about the

851
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,580
importance of education educating the

852
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,840
end user I used to do that all the time

853
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,080
used to say we gotta educate the end

854
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,610
user and i have a friend Scott Charney

855
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,819
works for Microsoft runs they're

856
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,960
involved and Billy area smart guy we

857
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,240
used to talk about that all the time how

858
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,470
we just had to educate the end user so

859
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,410
last time I talked to him when I was at

860
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:20,240
NSA he said yeah we're really i said

861
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:23,509
yeah we were he said what we didn't

862
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,729
understand was in this world it's not

863
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,590
it's not the risk management decision

864
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,480
you make for yourself it's the risk

865
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,930
management decision your friend makes

866
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,550
for you we're all sharing risk and that

867
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:39,020
shared risk is so critical in this world

868
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,700
he said he said let me describe my home

869
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,280
situation we talked about educating the

870
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,390
end-user tonight he said I have a

871
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,300
four-year-old son he loves to look at

872
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:53,480
videos of animals on the computer he'll

873
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:55,520
do that for hours and everyone he looks

874
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,770
at there's a link that he can click to

875
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,920
get another one and he can pick it out

876
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,060
because his different color quick

877
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:08,120
everyone so long when these little boxes

878
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:10,610
pops up he can't read but he knows if he

879
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:15,799
clicks that button he gets to see

880
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:19,310
another video so it clicks said the same

881
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,750
time my mother lives with us she's a

882
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:24,920
retired biology professor smart lady

883
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,650
that's I watched her one day she does a

884
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,840
lot of traveling all over the place she

885
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,040
likes to look at entertainment that's

886
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,680
going to be their shops that are going

887
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,610
to be there what am I going to do and

888
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,460
every once a while one of these little

889
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,590
windows pops up said so he watched her

890
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,140
when one popped up and she SAT there she

891
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,530
said she kept moving closer to the

892
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,670
screen like if she got close

893
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,970
not the words were going to make sense

894
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:52,950
to her said she did that for three

895
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:56,080
minutes and she backed up and hit ok

896
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,379
cousin ever didn't make sense we're

897
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,600
never going to get that four year old or

898
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:06,760
my mother to a point where they're smart

899
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:11,200
enough to outwit a Russian hacker you're

900
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,670
just not going to do it yeah i tell my

901
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,189
wife all the time don't click on

902
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,330
anything buddy let me click from work

903
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:21,580
and that way if something goes bad it's

904
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:23,590
not my assistant but serious so you see

905
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,230
this stuff yeah I try to get try to get

906
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,630
to her mail first cuz it my brother

907
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,210
travels a lot every time he travels he

908
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,790
gets hacked so I always go in whenever

909
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,960
he's on anywhere I try to get to her

910
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,710
account before she does because I know

911
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:42,130
whatever he said she's got to click on I

912
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:43,810
delete it before she can get to it but

913
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,600
the other day we got one from a from a

914
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:49,540
friend of mine and now are our email

915
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,360
countess is Lissa and deke her name's

916
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:55,060
Alyssa Alyssa and icky no spaces know

917
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,280
anything so we get this email from a

918
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,140
friend of mine dear Lissa and deke well

919
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,280
guess what none of my friends say dear

920
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:05,850
Lissa and deke with no spaces so she

921
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,850
clicked on it

922
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:12,579
and I said why would you do that and

923
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:23,200
then she looks and said what was your

924
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:25,089
friend I said no it wasn't so that

925
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,549
educating the injured it's critical we

926
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:29,140
have to educate the end user but we

927
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:32,829
can't think that that's going to win the

928
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,900
game for us it's like a car industry you

929
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:36,130
know when they put seat belts in cars a

930
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,849
lot of you probably don't remember that

931
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:41,349
cars didn't used to have seatbelts when

932
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:43,720
they put that in it was not well

933
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:48,880
received by the public or the car

934
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,919
manufacturer nowadays it's at least

935
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,390
somewhat recognized and you can even see

936
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,579
cars your advertising these safety

937
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,140
features I'm going to break when you

938
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,400
don't see the car in front of you I'm

939
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,660
going to warn you if something's

940
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,579
happening you know all these things

941
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:06,399
that'll make it safer oui oui us

942
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:08,890
particularly particularly students we've

943
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,500
got to build computers that will protect

944
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:15,759
the user not count on the user to

945
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,470
protect the computer i take this

946
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,359
training all the time this training it

947
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,220
just drives me nuts they give you a

948
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,859
three-line URL and say is this good or

949
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,480
bad then they say to see these six

950
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:27,040
characters that was active code here in

951
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,970
the middle I say yeah I got a snowball's

952
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,500
chance of finding that maybe the

953
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,779
computer could tell me if there's some

954
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,549
active code in there that would be good

955
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,579
then they tell you this was this one I

956
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:41,950
really love they say don't open it

957
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:44,290
attachment if you don't trust it yeah

958
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:48,609
it's like saying don't eat meat if you

959
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:50,049
think it's spoiled who opens an

960
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:55,720
attachment that they don't trust the

961
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:58,030
whole point is to make you trust it so

962
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,348
we we've got to educate people hey I'm

963
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,049
sitting with these professors they're

964
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:05,710
saying yo we did this training for this

965
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:07,660
company we yeah we ran six months we

966
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:09,819
trained their people when we started

967
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,490
only thirty percent of them recognized

968
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:14,259
phishing emails after six months sixty

969
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,169
percent of them recognized phishing

970
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,720
emails you're thinking wow we're wasted

971
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,270
six months

972
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,520
if you know you don't need a hundred

973
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:26,580
percent of the people to click on it

974
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,530
it's it's a shared risk your sharing

975
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,710
this stuff that's the whole point and

976
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,990
these if you if you look at that Vincent

977
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:37,940
that guy in the front line he had six

978
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:40,470
people in his net every decision he made

979
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,820
he had two things he had to stay alive

980
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,799
and complete the mission everything else

981
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,570
was his risk management decision and he

982
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,570
shared that risk with five other guys

983
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,550
but they all had basically the same

984
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:55,619
threat profile it was fair in today's

985
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,690
world he doesn't have a Vincent he's got

986
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,970
a laptop and is connected to the base

987
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:02,880
and that's connected to the Pentagon and

988
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,230
the threat model is not the same for

989
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,080
that forward observer as it is for the

990
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:10,970
Pentagon and when he makes a risk

991
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:14,190
management decision he shares that risk

992
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:18,509
with the whole Pentagon it's not five

993
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:25,020
guys it's five million guys it's a whole

994
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:27,930
different game we've got to take it we

995
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,849
got to take that risk away we've got to

996
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:34,379
build stuff that will protect us it's

997
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:36,869
important to leave that that weapons

998
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,450
threat on the table whenever I ran war

999
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:41,640
games i did that i made sure we had a

1000
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,810
nuclear threat on the table because i

1001
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,060
figured the adversaries we're going to

1002
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:46,859
get access to our game at some point

1003
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,119
time and I wanted them to see it was

1004
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:53,660
there I didn't expect we ever use it

1005
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:56,310
that's pretty safe to say we never will

1006
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,890
but they don't have to know that you've

1007
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:02,040
got hope you got to leave it in play you

1008
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:06,569
know it comes down to people everywhere

1009
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,670
its people people write the code it's

1010
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:12,810
got holes in it people build the stuff

1011
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:17,369
do they do they build bad stuff in and

1012
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:18,869
people make decisions chair that risk so

1013
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,119
I'm going to tell you once one story

1014
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:24,589
about risk sharing then I'll leave a

1015
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:30,810
little bit of time for questions so um

1016
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:32,020
back in 2004 the director of NSA walked

1017
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:34,960
into my office

1018
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:37,000
so I've decided we want to be more

1019
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,210
public with stuff we need to be out

1020
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,760
there I'm going to give the lunchtime

1021
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,250
keynote at black hat there's a way to

1022
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,860
open it up I said wow really you're

1023
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,140
because because we we were not used to

1024
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:53,530
being out there we were kind of hidden

1025
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:56,710
he said yep and you're going to give me

1026
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:59,320
the story that i'm going to tell so I

1027
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,340
said okay so I wrote out I wasn't

1028
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,370
writing a speech because he had good

1029
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:07,330
speech writers but I did give him a

1030
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:09,069
storyline about the government doesn't

1031
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:12,190
stand for the government the government

1032
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,840
stands for the people we need to protect

1033
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,730
the people and the best way we can do

1034
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,820
that is by building security that they

1035
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,590
can use we got a partner with academia

1036
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,600
we've got a partner with industry the

1037
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,430
government can't stand on its own it's

1038
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,110
got to be a partner that means has gotta

1039
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:29,950
share technology sheer understanding

1040
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,850
share knowledge share everything and it

1041
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:36,189
was it was a pretty good story so I

1042
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,660
liked it I liked the story line about a

1043
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:40,990
week later I got a speech from his

1044
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,879
speech writers it was great they did a

1045
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:47,549
really good job of writing that speech

1046
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,550
so I thought this is going to be a hit

1047
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:53,350
and a week before black hat I got a call

1048
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,790
from his exec saying the directors

1049
00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:00,580
decided if you'd like you to give the

1050
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:02,200
speech in his place at black hat and I

1051
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,310
said really because I think the people

1052
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,779
black had her going to be a little

1053
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,290
disappointed when they're expecting a

1054
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,390
general to come out and they get me and

1055
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:12,580
she said no he's already told them and

1056
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,230
they're expecting you so at this point

1057
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:17,490
in time it doesn't look like it's a he'd

1058
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,490
ask if you'd like to do that

1059
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:26,490
looks like I'm on my way so I said okay

1060
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,380
why cuz this is a good speech and he's

1061
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,118
gonna be a hit and it's important that I

1062
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,920
mean if he wants NSA to be out there

1063
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,300
he's got to be the guy takes us out

1064
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:39,570
there she said he will but not this time

1065
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,700
it's okay how come and see why you have

1066
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:43,950
to talk to Bob Jones not the real name

1067
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,009
but he gave me the name it's a guy I

1068
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:50,009
knew yeah it's good guy works in

1069
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:53,850
security so i called him i said it's at

1070
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:57,450
the bob the directors got this really

1071
00:49:53,850 --> 00:50:00,569
good speech for black hat he's going to

1072
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:06,330
be a hit now he wants me to do it

1073
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:08,460
instead how come Bob said well we've got

1074
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,600
some information that if the director

1075
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:17,190
shows up there's going to be an

1076
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:20,430
assassination attempt so we got together

1077
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:22,109
we talked about it yesterday and we

1078
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:30,868
decided that you're not that good at

1079
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:32,100
target so we'll take the risk now that's

1080
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:35,820
a discussion i would have liked have

1081
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,259
been involved in because my view of

1082
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:42,930
acceptable risk might have been

1083
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:46,170
different than theirs needless to say I

1084
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,490
was not shot at but I tell you I never

1085
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,430
scanned an audience the way I did that

1086
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:52,109
day 3,500 people out there eating lunch

1087
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:57,180
if one of them in reach for napkin I was

1088
00:50:52,109 --> 00:51:00,410
going to be on the ground that shared

1089
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:04,919
risk that will kill you and don't forget

1090
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,990
every time you open that laptop you're

1091
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,619
accepting all the risk that everybody

1092
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:13,529
else this university is decided to share

1093
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:17,460
with you so if they've gone to a really

1094
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:23,180
interesting website overseas you may get

1095
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,180
a present some night I'll take questions

1096
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:30,308
no questions cool we have time for a few

1097
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:40,390
questions please use the mic there in

1098
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:41,920
the aisle if you would like ask any well

1099
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,288
I'll just make the observation here you

1100
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,650
mentioned mentioned museum the National

1101
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:50,200
Cryptologic Museum is just off the

1102
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:52,839
grounds of Fort Meade in Maryland it is

1103
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,058
free and open to the public you can all

1104
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,400
visit and to the best of my knowledge

1105
00:51:55,059 --> 00:51:58,839
they don't they don't snoop on your

1106
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,670
phone or your name or anything when you

1107
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:03,099
go in but they have some wonderful

1108
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:06,130
exhibits on the history of cryptography

1109
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:08,529
it's a really great place to visit I

1110
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:13,420
want to put a plug in there that's a

1111
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:17,079
great place any questions well in that

1112
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:30,130
case let's share the risk by giving a

1113
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:33,119
pause to our speaker I think that's a

1114
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:37,000
fantastic way to close out the 17th

1115
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:39,359
annual serious security symposium I

1116
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,670
would like to thank you all for coming

1117
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,710
participating listening contributing and

1118
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:47,859
supporting all the work that we have

1119
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:50,589
been doing here over the years we have

1120
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:54,460
already blocked out some dates a year

1121
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:57,009
from now this week next year we will do

1122
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,410
this again with a slightly different

1123
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:01,180
cast of characters but nonetheless we

1124
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,759
certainly invite you to participate and

1125
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:06,730

1126
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:08,500
year to come so thank you all have a

1127
