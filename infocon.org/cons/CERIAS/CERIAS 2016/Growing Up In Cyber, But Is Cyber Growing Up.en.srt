1
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,400
good afternoon and welcome to another

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,590
one of our cybersecurity seminars for

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,229
those of you who are in the room or who

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,289
are watching this in near real time this

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,170
is the first seminar of national

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,489
cybersecurity month october is been

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,980
designated as national cybersecurity

8
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,750
month in the US and there are various

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,730
kinds of events and recognitions

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:45,019
occurring around the country about that

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:48,029
and what we're doing here today is

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,370
having a talk by someone who has been

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,170
involved in cybersecurity longer than I

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,629
have and there aren't a lot of people

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,070
who have that distinction although there

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,340
are a number of distinguished

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,129
individuals including our speaker Tony

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:08,399
Sager has been involved in cybersecurity

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,960
for about four decades and and and has

20
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,360
been very productive in a number of

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,360
different pursuits there he will tell us

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,760
some about that and provide this very

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,220
long baseline view of the cybersecurity

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,580
arena some of his thoughts on it and

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,479
about whether or not it's maturing he is

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,179
currently a senior VP and strategist at

27
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,010
the Center for Internet at security a

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,890
nonprofit that he'll tell you a little

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:39,090
bit about and please join me in

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,650
welcoming Tony Sager thank you very much

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,369
staff and thank you all for joining this

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,810
afternoon yeah as a staff said well

33
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,369
we've been trying to schedule this for

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,930
at least a couple of years I retired

35
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,329
from the National Security Agency in

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,189
2012 and we go back quite a few years

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,689
and we talked about this several times

38
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,369
and we finally be able to pull off the

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,339
schedule so I'm glad it worked out and

40
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,380
thank you for joining us well said I and

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,780
I woke up one day and I realize I might

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,839
be one of the longest tenured longest

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,640
continuing continuously serving cyber

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,860
defenders in the entire business and

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,319
completely by accident I wish I could

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,450
tell you I had some great vision and

47
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,189
wisdom as to where the field was going

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,290
and what would be important someday and

49
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:20,730
I planned my career according

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,739
but of course that's not what happened i

51
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,250
just stumbled into this so in the

52
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,980
mid-70s I wound up by accident applying

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,689
for work at the National Security Agency

54
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,480
my real dream was to be an operations

55
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,920
research type mathematician at aberdeen

56
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,149
proving ground where my dad had been in

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,869
the army and i remember i wound up in

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,450
the math faculty area one day and a

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,859
recent alumnus had walked in and it

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,828
turned out if you can kind of picture

61
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:51,450
the world of the mid-70s this person who

62
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,150
had never met before but was a graduate

63
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,030
of the same program was the perfect NSA

64
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,329
employee of his day advanced degree in

65
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,090
math native Russian speaker that was

66
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,909
like instant job security in the 70s

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,230
right so he was a somehow he had wounded

68
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,790
up with the National Security Agency so

69
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,959
he said what are you gonna do after you

70
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,120
graduate I said I hadn't really thought

71
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,040
about it but here everyone thinking and

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,530
he said well what about NSA have you

73
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,409
ever considered that and I said NSA with

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,239
the rockets and stuff fight and he said

75
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,798
no no when I say he wound up but he had

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,659
a little brochure which I still have to

77
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,370
this day with a phone number in it

78
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,560
called the phone number wound up at

79
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,389
college park maryland taking the hardest

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,780
math test I've ever taken in my life and

81
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,370
got a call some ten months later we'd

82
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,650
like to have you join us if you can

83
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,150
report in two weeks so that was the

84
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,729
nature of bureaucracy back then so I

85
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,889
stumbled into the NSA working and spent

86
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,840
thirty four and a half years all of it

87
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,579
working in the defensive mission at NSA

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,349
so I'll give you a quick little bit of

89
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:54,840
history because I as I as my career

90
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:57,569
evolved I realized I was kind of

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,609
stumbling along as part of the evolution

92
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,768
of the field that we now call

93
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,970
cybersecurity right and again i wish i

94
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,109
could tell you i was really thinking big

95
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,760
thoughts and knew what was going to

96
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,669
happen but that's not what happened at

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,989
all so so my my career history wound up

98
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,180
interwoven with the world that were in

99
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,569
today and so i'm going to offer some

100
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,120
observations sort of a you know recap

101
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,978
some of the big themes that have emerged

102
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,860
over time you know I've had enough

103
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,810
experience learned a lot of lessons I

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,360
often joke that the business of

105
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,000
cybersecurity is the failure business

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,720
right now we learn more from mistakes so

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,370
there's this famous quote from will

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,890
you know we good judgment comes from

109
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,260
experience experience comes from bad

110
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,219
judgment ie making mistakes I've been in

111
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,980
the room for some of the most amazing

112
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,750
mistakes you could ever imagine and so

113
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,970
some of them I made myself as a matter

114
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,950
of fact but the idea was you learn a lot

115
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,680
in this business from failure right from

116
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,090
seeing how things break from incidents

117
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,920
being reported right from breeches and

118
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,510
all that kind of stuff and it's

119
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,340
unfortunate that we have to learn so

120
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,620
much negatively but that really seems to

121
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,630
be a you know an inherent part of the

122
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,400
business here so if you're old enough in

123
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,810
computer security you have some kind of

124
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,429
equation like this running through your

125
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,740
head and they're all they're all

126
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,900
slightly different but it doesn't really

127
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,580
matter but let me explain to your mind

128
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,020
that normally I'm talking to math phobe

129
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,300
audiences I don't think that's going to

130
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,950
be the case here so but so I normally

131
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,910
read them this equation in English so

132
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,340
I'm going to read it too but it's not

133
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,330
because you don't understand the math so

134
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,159
I often say we're not really in the

135
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,349
cyber business or whatever we're in the

136
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
risk business right where risk is a

137
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,380
function of three primary variables

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,359
vulnerability threat consequence and

139
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,550
there's a fourth variable the one we get

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,770
to manipulate directly right controls is

141
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,050
the all-purpose word for defensive

142
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,060
things I can do right actions i can take

143
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:49,030
technology i can buy training i can

144
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,800
deliver and normally i apply controls so

145
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,359
i can change the value of the other

146
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,640
three variables right so I'd like to

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,830
drive my vulnerability lower and I do

148
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,860
that by some technology some training

149
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,479
the way I develop software etc I'd like

150
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,830
to know more about threats so I can make

151
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,419
good decisions right so I can spend

152
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,729
money to learn about thread I can

153
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,370
subscribe to threat feeds I can get

154
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,250
reporting you know I can deploy my own

155
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,540
people like an x sensors all those kinds

156
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,570
of things allow me to learn more about

157
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,729
threat and then consequences is really a

158
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,500
function of the business model the the

159
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,300
agency's mission or whatever the real

160
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,340
desired outcome of the businesses right

161
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,320
I can do things to help me manage

162
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,840
consequence you know like the big buzz

163
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,080
over lost laptops and taxis that's a big

164
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,119
thing in the areas that I work and of

165
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,590
course you know you could encrypt the

166
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,660
data right so it's at rest on these

167
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,820
laptops well that's a technical control

168
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,810
but there why are you doing it what

169
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,940
you're doing it really to manage the

170
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,800
consequence right so if the laptop gets

171
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,629
lost it's a lost piece of technology

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,520
the data is inaccessible so the

173
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,139
consequence to the business as much as

174
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,090
well managed in the case like that if

175
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,919
you do it well anyway so there's these

176
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,840
these variables are always kind of

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,128
running in your head so my career it can

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,650
actually be summarized in this equation

179
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,490
right I was hired to be a vulnerability

180
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:07,508
analyst so on behalf of the fence hired

181
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,970
to pretend to attack us systems us

182
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,470
cryptography initially so that we would

183
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,970
understand what was wrong right so we

184
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,599
could understand our vulnerability and

185
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,860
do something about it now those are

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,830
historically the time seemed pretty

187
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,169
quaint compared to the day back then 10

188
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,969
to 15 years to build a new radio for the

189
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,889
US Army right long development programs

190
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:33,009
gigantic budgets relative relatively

191
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,780
speaking you know the other thing that

192
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,250
we had back then and believe me we were

193
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,409
working really hard again it doesn't

194
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,020
seem like it by today's standards but we

195
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:43,210
had the luxury of lots of time right the

196
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,830
long development times we had a

197
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,500
relatively large amount of money to

198
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,150
invest to improve security but most

199
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,759
importantly we had control of the

200
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,349
environment hey we could decide you

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,150
participated you either have a security

202
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,440
clearance or you don't your trusted

203
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,000
company to the US government or you're

204
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,580
not right it was a kind of a binary

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,050
decision you're in you were out and

206
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,758
think of that as control of the

207
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,990
environment and in today's world of

208
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,789
course you have essentially none of

209
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,529
those right you don't have much time to

210
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,818
make security decisions you don't have

211
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,770
an infinite budget and you certainly

212
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,330
don't have control of the environment so

213
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,359
we go from a world where the government

214
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,340
sort of runs this activity is in control

215
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,270
of it to one where it doesn't I'll talk

216
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,250
a little bit about what all that means

217
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,340
so another way to look at my career I

218
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,110
tried to diagram all the jobs I had in

219
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,460
organizations I was a part of or I

220
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,069
managed during my time so look at the

221
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,919
lower left I was hired as a calm sec

222
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,709
analyst communication security right so

223
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,468
looking at the cryptography primarily of

224
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,018
us systems us randomization key

225
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,300
management and things like that and

226
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,430
playing the role of bad guy right now

227
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,620
why would you do that remember the prior

228
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,890
equation right function of vulnerability

229
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,649
and threat so remember in those days

230
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:56,380
historically at a national level we

231
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:58,060
thought of having one enemy right it

232
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,499
wasn't that this sort of wide open world

233
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,238
there was

234
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:03,179
sort of one nation that was a threat to

235
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:05,009
our existence and how much did we know

236
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,829
about this threat to our existence how

237
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:09,389
much threat intelligence did we have

238
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,679
well even as a person who had lots of

239
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,509
security clearances I can tell you we

240
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,339
didn't really know very much right there

241
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,129
was no market place of threat feeds

242
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,229
there wasn't this wide open reporting of

243
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:22,229
attackers and successes and their

244
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:24,719
failures so we we believed we were

245
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,689
vulnerable right we believe there was an

246
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:29,189
existential threat so what do you do if

247
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:31,169
you're a risk decision maker and you're

248
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:34,259
faced with this really heavy threat and

249
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:36,149
you don't understand it well you by

250
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,999
nature I the rational person then says

251
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,769
I'm going to think about all the bad

252
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:42,359
things that could happen I'm going to

253
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,569
plan for the worst designed for the

254
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:47,369
worst and build for the worst and one

255
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,779
way I do that is I hire a bunch of geeky

256
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,519
people to be in the back room to pretend

257
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,019
to be the bad guy right we call that

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,199
penetration testing red teaming black

259
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,819
hatting vulnerability analysis so that

260
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,519
was really the role that folks like me

261
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:01,289
played right we were there to help

262
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,559
understand the threat so that we could

263
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,779
make good design decisions now again you

264
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,728
do that because you have the luxury of

265
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,439
lots of time money and control of the

266
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:13,470
environment right none of which we have

267
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:15,478
in any great supply today so so lower

268
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,549
left CommSec and then all these other

269
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:19,169
threads and you know spath has a role

270
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,639
coming into computer security and all

271
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,669
these different things so there were

272
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,589
many organizations threads and you can

273
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,139
see okay so communication security was

274
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,079
aimed at what what question primarily in

275
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,409
security confidentiality right and if

276
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,149
you can narrow your security concern to

277
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,829
confidentiality you're actually in

278
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,869
pretty good shape at least by today's

279
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,909
standards right because what do you do

280
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:44,779
with confidentiality you equate the

281
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:48,659
difficulty of protecting communications

282
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:50,669
with a really hard well known to be hard

283
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,409
mathematical problem right that's why

284
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:54,779
mathematics was the primary discipline

285
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,479
of those days so you say if I can equate

286
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,309
the difficulty of reading my mail to a

287
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:02,369
known hard enough medical problem what

288
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:04,679
do I get for free centuries of research

289
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:07,019
and mathematics right like factoring and

290
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,848
problems like that so that's why you do

291
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,529
that that's why at the heart of it

292
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:11,240
cryptography is really a mathematicians

293
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:14,060
game

294
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,089
and so that was the way we thought of

295
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,189
the security problem to be solved

296
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,680
therefore the primary career field was

297
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,839
around CommSec mathematical crypt

298
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,430
analysis and so forth but of course you

299
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
know and those days are kind of quaint

300
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,760
by today's complex standards right so we

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,890
start tapped we have to worry about them

302
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,350
as information becomes more fluid it

303
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,060
moves more it's in more places lots more

304
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,470
people have to see it you have to worry

305
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,540
about the technology that handles it

306
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,260
moves it etc right so computer security

307
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,790
and they have to worry about the as

308
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,290
information takes more form the security

309
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,630
of the information itself becomes the

310
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,939
driver not the cryptography not the

311
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,310
computing device so you have information

312
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,350
security system security all these

313
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,060
things start to become the way you have

314
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,610
to think about this problem the

315
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,680
all-purpose term that emerged quite some

316
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,589
time ago still the name of the mission

317
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,699
at NSA's information assurance that was

318
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,130
actually kind of a breakthrough in

319
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,480
security right there was a bit of nuance

320
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,670
they're not everyone understood it but

321
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,130
information assurance was meant to imply

322
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,110
there is no golden state known as

323
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,870
security right there's no there's no

324
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,510
done there's no end state here assurance

325
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,430
is about confidence right measuring

326
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,380
confidence or making an assessment of

327
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,180
confidence which changes constantly

328
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,160
because you get constant new information

329
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,370
right so your world gets more complex

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,689
you learn more about bad guys the

331
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,250
business makes more demands upon

332
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,829
information technology so you have this

333
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,100
complex changing environment and so

334
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,899
assurance was meant to imply this you

335
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,029
know sort of never-ending struggle to

336
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,529
both learn what I should worry about and

337
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,570
then take action upon it so that's still

338
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,120
historically around eventually and you

339
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,300
can see as these names go on right they

340
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,740
they are broader and broader in scope

341
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,099
bigger in their thinking about the

342
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,020
problem and had sort of more generic or

343
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,220
more general and we today and there's

344
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,779
all these different pieces down there

345
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,700
that it turns out almost all these

346
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,100
correspond to organizations I was a part

347
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,279
of for eighty percent of them I never

348
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,279
actually changed desks right it wasn't

349
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:16,550
me following the evolving cyber mission

350
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,400
it was the organization the institution

351
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,529
evolving to deal with a growing

352
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,360
awareness of the problem and it's what

353
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,040
should we do about it so we we think

354
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,259
ourselves revamp army

355
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,939
rename ourselves and grows and grows

356
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,100
until you come to the all-purpose word

357
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,360
cyber and I don't know what you what

358
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,089
your culture is here but anyone who says

359
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,990
cyber with nothing after it my probably

360
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,790
doesn't know what they're talking about

361
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,949
right there are more cyber warriors

362
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,259
walking around the DoD right now who

363
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:44,149
couldn't spell IT if you get spotted in

364
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,740
the eye I mean it's because it's trendy

365
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,050
right it's the hot thing you can get

366
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,730
more money and authority and power so

367
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,439
that's the nature bureaucracy so another

368
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,990
parallel reason for these renaming Zyzz

369
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,690
because I call it the salute to fly or a

370
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,790
taller flag theory of organizational

371
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,199
design whatever it is you're working on

372
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,639
Jane is real that's really nice but I'm

373
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,099
working on something grander and the

374
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,019
flag is taller and we salute even more

375
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,699
so i'm going to rename myself to have a

376
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,920
grander name than yours you know so it's

377
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,779
a bit of a chase for authority and so

378
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,550
forth and i'm not a cynical bureaucrat

379
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:17,420
but that's been the way i've observed it

380
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,550
over these years so complex lots of

381
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,680
changes but i think of it as the you

382
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,660
know as our understanding of the problem

383
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,910
grows as the complexity of the problem

384
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,490
itself gross or all this you know this

385
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,110
world of we I never thought that I said

386
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,850
how did I miss the meeting where we

387
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,790
thought it would be a good idea to share

388
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,690
our network with the bad guys right you

389
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,790
know when you're old enough you think

390
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,260
well we had if it was sensitive we had

391
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,750
our own networks write our own leased

392
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,389
lines at parallel communications pass

393
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,120
you know we controlled the environment

394
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:50,540
right and then this internet thing is

395
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,970
and you know it's a great thing that I

396
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,040
did but the complexity of the security

397
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,839
problem just exploded right we have our

398
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,300
economy our national treasure our

399
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,790
personal wealth everything about our

400
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,189
health is essentially floating around in

401
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,689
the public and so again it wasn't a

402
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,579
conscious choice to operate like this

403
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,850
but that's that's the natural natural

404
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:12,859
evolution of this so if i could i call

405
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,439
these the seismic shifts so that's kind

406
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,579
of big movements in the business so most

407
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:21,009
of them i've talked to you about already

408
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:24,019
this this focus the singular focus on

409
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:25,459
confidentiality cryptography right what

410
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,949
we called comp communications here your

411
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,109
comm sec back then much more broadly now

412
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:32,120
focused and if you think of cyber as the

413
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,389
all-purpose were then it encompasses all

414
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,800
of that right from confidentiality by

415
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,510
the integrity of information

416
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,050
availability the economic issues

417
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,180
underlying

418
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,420
the primary discipline goes from

419
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,459
mathematics mathematics is you know when

420
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,140
your mathematician math is the center of

421
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:50,510
the universe you know that's that's it

422
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,000
talk to you in the in your introductory

423
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,370
classes but there are all these other

424
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,779
fields that have dramatic impact on

425
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,010
security right from computer science

426
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:03,680
engineering networking operations so I

427
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,930
shifted my career early i started i

428
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,180
mentioned as a mathematician working on

429
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,729
cryptography of us systems my life was

430
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,410
changed forever around nineteen eighty

431
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,750
or so with the personal computer

432
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,029
revolution and I switched my career

433
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,269
field from math to scienter puter

434
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,439
science for one reason I figured out the

435
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,940
government would buy me an apple two

436
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,279
plus two have on my desk if I switched

437
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,470
my career field and I thought that was a

438
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,050
coolest thing ever right because I grew

439
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,880
up with mainframes punch cards anyone

440
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,229
old enough like punch cards you have to

441
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,820
be really nice to the guy behind the

442
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,100
counter so you can get more than one run

443
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,329
done during the day oh my gosh that's

444
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,089
like Stone Age I thought that was the

445
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:45,469
most tedious you know unpleasant way to

446
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,480
spend my analytic time so this idea of

447
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,459
having computing power on your desk

448
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,899
under your control that one human being

449
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,729
could understand it was really

450
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,649
extraordinary to me so why would the

451
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,079
government bhaiyya know a nice young

452
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,089
person like me an Apple 2 plus it was

453
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,920
because they wanted to support my

454
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,890
hobbies and my personal interests not at

455
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,349
all because we were moving to a world

456
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,790
where this commodity computing right

457
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,520
driven by what we used to call before

458
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,188
that the microprocessor revolution was

459
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,639
changing everything see I started in the

460
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,110
organization's i started in don't laugh

461
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,530
software was considered too unreliable

462
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:24,109
too flaky to do anything important in

463
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,209
security all cryptography was built in

464
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,069
custom hardware all nuclear weapons

465
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,679
control systems were in custom hardware

466
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,120
right because we could control it we

467
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,100
could design it we could test it we

468
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,909
could model it we could model what

469
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,490
happened conceptually at every gate and

470
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,440
transistor and pretend it failed and see

471
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,000
if that had an outcome we didn't like if

472
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,110
so i'm going to put an alarm on there or

473
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,470
I'm going to duplicate it right now

474
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,668
going to put some selectra circuitry

475
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,280
hardware was reliable hardware could be

476
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:57,110
trusted software way too flaky

477
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:59,000
right but economics always wins so these

478
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,250
little micro processors and personal

479
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,570
computers start to sneak in as the front

480
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,730
panel display for the hardware

481
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,350
cryptography the interface box the

482
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,900
communications controller right the

483
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,310
panel the display panels it was

484
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:17,270
inevitable you know very inexpensive

485
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:19,700
very cheap very easy to reuse integrated

486
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,860
circuitry allowed us to have these kinds

487
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,680
of functions at incredible cost right

488
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,060
incredibly low costs at the cost of the

489
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,800
loss of control right you're buying

490
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,330
things really off the marketplace so a

491
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,620
lot of designs came in about that time

492
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,629
to take advantage of this commodity

493
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,270
hardware but then to try the duplicate

494
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,380
triplicate workaround build alarms and

495
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,510
all kinds of workarounds to try to

496
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,980
actually make this this useful so you

497
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,960
move from Matthew move to all these

498
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,480
other disciplines when I switched though

499
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,660
from math to computer science people at

500
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,360
ennis I thought I just committed career

501
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,190
suicide right because the computer

502
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,350
science people at that time oh that's

503
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,710
I've heard this many times that's just

504
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,689
the implementation of security math is

505
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,250
where the action is and then that

506
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,050
software that you know that actually

507
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,150
controls whether the cryptography works

508
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,300
or not that's mere implementation

509
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,560
details okay I didn't mind because I was

510
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,960
having so much fun I thought was so

511
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,330
interesting so that we we then

512
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,070
shift other another big shift this focus

513
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,189
from the technology itself right the

514
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,720
math how good is the hardware to how

515
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,010
does it get used because we all know

516
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,180
this is one of the lessons of modern

517
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,540
life right no matter how good your

518
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,550
security in about how good your product

519
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,310
users are incredibly creative at undoing

520
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:34,850
security right that's just our nature

521
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:38,179
and so operations has started to

522
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,980
dominate the cyber business right the

523
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,050
attackers the game us versus them

524
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,270
incident management or instant response

525
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,100
all these things have taken over and you

526
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,230
move to this sort of quasi war fighting

527
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,260
you know heroic battling back and forth

528
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,000
and so these other disciplines start to

529
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,860
really come in as important in this and

530
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,210
we move from well we got this we got the

531
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,939
technology right and too bad they

532
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,080
couldn't use it well right two people in

533
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,450
the security business are active

534
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,129
participants right we're in the fight so

535
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,380
we cover the range now from the ideas

536
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,000
the research the basic technology

537
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,820
the mathematics up to and including the

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,070
operational use of things there's a talk

539
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,010
I used to give and the title is I'm a

540
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,200
reformed monopolist okay me that world

541
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,330
of the 70s I told you about right that

542
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,830
was a government monopoly yeah but it's

543
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,050
not a bad thing that's just where we

544
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,340
were if you cared about security you

545
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,680
were somehow associated with the US

546
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,389
government because we treated it

547
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,880
rightfully like a national security

548
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,310
problem we don't all build our own

549
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,950
armies here in town right we pay our

550
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,230
taxes the national government protects

551
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:43,430
us against enemies out there beyond our

552
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,540
borders in physical space we don't even

553
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,400
think differently about it and that's

554
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,430
kind of the nature of the way we thought

555
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,070
of this game in the 70s and 80s there

556
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,140
were enemies and their friends and we

557
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,540
could decide who they were we knew who

558
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,190
they were but now the world is much more

559
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,659
complicated right so we move from the

560
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,030
government will tell you when technology

561
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,620
is safe enough that was one of the jobs

562
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,460
i played right test something to make

563
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,500
sure it's acceptable to an open market

564
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,640
so we go from 10 years to develop a

565
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,920
radio and the government will tell you

566
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,360
when it's good enough to my gosh where's

567
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,430
my new iphone they haven't come out with

568
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,550
anything in a year you know and whatever

569
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,230
it is I need it now I didn't know I

570
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,909
needed a month ago but I need it now and

571
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,800
that puts a lot of pressure on the

572
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,810
security business right there's no 10

573
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,790
years to make a security decision there

574
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,919
is no room full of analysts at least in

575
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,960
the government sense that gets to study

576
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,020
this commercial technology before it

577
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,550
comes out right so it puts tons of

578
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,830
pressure on our ability to make good to

579
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,570
security decisions and then the last one

580
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,530
is really the driver and I'm going to

581
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,689
leave you with this and this sort of

582
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,970
seismic shifts I talked about the way we

583
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,360
thought of cyber as a national security

584
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,600
problem right and it is but that was the

585
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,040
entire focus of the 70s or so but today

586
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,780
what's driving the business i'll give

587
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,629
you some examples a bit it's really

588
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,850
about economic and social risk that's

589
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,010
what's really driving us today the most

590
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,050
and i do a lot of public speaking the

591
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,330
most frequent requests i'm getting for

592
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,889
the last year or so are not from

593
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,879
technologists not from security people i

594
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,450
know if you're tired of hearing for me

595
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,960
or not but you who asked to understand

596
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,779
about this problem insurance companies

597
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,609
auditors law firms

598
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,629
there's not a law firm certainly in the

599
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,249
DC area that doesn't have a

600
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:26,349
cybersecurity Institute now with a

601
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,759
certification right every insurance

602
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:30,580
company is in this business every

603
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,710
auditing firm has a some sort of a cyber

604
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,408
auditing you know division associated

605
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,269
with them they're all coming now it's

606
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:38,529
technologists you know that makes us

607
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,210
uncomfortable oh my gosh the lawyers

608
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,759
will ruin this well you know but this is

609
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,539
the way social creatures we organize

610
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,729
ourselves right this is what happens

611
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:51,789
it's not about technology it's about how

612
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:53,259
human beings citizens institutions make

613
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,039
decisions which are driven by things

614
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:58,809
like economics and social ideas right

615
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,190
perceptions of risk so there's a term

616
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,989
i'm using i'll try it on please don't

617
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,080
take it personally we might have hit

618
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:08,080
peak geek here in cyber security right

619
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,759
this idea of this is driven by geeks and

620
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,049
you know don't be worried there's plenty

621
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,389
of great work out there for all of us

622
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:16,539
that's not the issue but when we think

623
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:20,379
of it as a wizard and geek driven

624
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:22,989
business then we take one perspective in

625
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:26,439
terms of its impact on society but

626
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:28,359
rightfully in terms of how decisions get

627
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,639
made at grand scale and the role of

628
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:32,830
citizens and companies it's really

629
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,908
driven by the last line up here so so

630
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,599
think about that event I think the way

631
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:38,979
some other examples here's all the sort

632
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,749
of a lessons learn now those were the

633
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:42,309
big big themes from my perspective but

634
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:44,229
lessons learned so anyone remember the

635
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,969
movie Independence Day not the not the

636
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:48,700
recent remake know the real independence

637
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:51,399
a movie right so often say cybersecurity

638
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,009
is not like Independence Day what do I

639
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:55,748
mean Independence Day the movie the

640
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,909
aliens are coming right big mothership

641
00:23:55,749 --> 00:24:01,330
and all that kind of stuff we know who

642
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:04,029
the enemy is there their heroic

643
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,978
brilliant people on our side take the

644
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,749
alien technology turn it around against

645
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:09,789
them come up with a clever virus they

646
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:13,539
fly up to the mothership deliver the

647
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:16,539
virus boom battle is done we all get to

648
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:17,830
cheer it's over we win that's not

649
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,169
cybersecurity if you work in

650
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,489
cybersecurity as a practitioner it's

651
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,159
much more like the movie Groundhog Day

652
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:26,769
it's the same thing over and over it and

653
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,570
you can get it right 50 days in a row

654
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,979
guess how many parades there are for

655
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,009
cyber security practitioners and

656
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,880
defenders not that many rights back not

657
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,830
many parade

658
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,110
for us who are slogging through it's a

659
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,760
great day when nothing happens and very

660
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,830
few people are wise enough to thank you

661
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,670
for it but you certainly get their

662
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,179
attention when something bad happens

663
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,520
right CISOs are hired to be fired and so

664
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,770
there's you know it's a it can be a

665
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,900
thankless business and yet it's

666
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,490
incredibly satisfying I mean I chose to

667
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,590
spend my 35 years doing this stuff

668
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,360
because I think the challenge of defense

669
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,060
is so much more interesting and

670
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,550
satisfying and my friends who work off

671
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,530
and say oh you got to do is find one

672
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,540
thing and exploited big deal right well

673
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,670
they're a lot better than that but still

674
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,139
you know their challenges are really

675
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,940
different but at least they get victory

676
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,370
every once in a while right at least

677
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,410
they get to take care of a bad guy steal

678
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,300
the information inform the US government

679
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,000
whatever it happens to be they get more

680
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,020
victories they get more parades get used

681
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,870
to it that's the nature of the business

682
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:30,010
right it's okay defense is amazing in

683
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,590
its own right another lesson for me so I

684
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,370
mentioned that that equation right my

685
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,439
life was in vulnerability so one of the

686
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,570
reasons I spend time putting these ideas

687
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,510
together and talk to you people by

688
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,850
nature of the work that I've done I

689
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,490
think I've seen as many things break as

690
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,780
may be anybody in the business so I

691
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,480
spent the first third of my life

692
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,889
professional life learning the craft of

693
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,350
finding vulnerabilities right initially

694
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,510
in mathematics right and it says an

695
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,550
amazing institution with a in-house body

696
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,490
of knowledge and a great system to bring

697
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,500
people up in that in that technical

698
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,110
discipline switch to computer security

699
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,760
spent my lot of my technical time is

700
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,530
what was called a software vulnerability

701
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,150
analyst think of it as finding zero days

702
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,930
and i called it reading other people's

703
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:19,540
software for the 411 and then scaling

704
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:22,450
that up to look at systems networks and

705
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,430
up to operational testing so red teams

706
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,500
in sa red team was one of my groups blue

707
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,570
team and when nations fight against

708
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,400
nations right this is not a packet to

709
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,070
packet fight this is a thick of it as a

710
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,110
full dimensional fight everything from

711
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,360
the software to the hardware to the bugs

712
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,669
and the walls and implants and you know

713
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,949
signal theory and signal stealing and

714
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,910
you know all cameras in hidden in a

715
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,220
little bit all that stuff you've seen

716
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,830
the movies it's not quite that good

717
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,830
it's pretty close okay so that's how

718
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,590
nations compete so at the peak job I had

719
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:56,980
we're at 750 people whose sole purpose

720
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,590
was to find flaws so I got to see a lot

721
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,780
of these both directly is created by my

722
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,799
groups but also in my work with the rest

723
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,379
of the Defense Department the

724
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,929
intelligence community huge hunks of the

725
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,980
industry I've worked a lot with on these

726
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:13,750
so got to observe over and over again

727
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,809
problems right try to understand root

728
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,640
cause see how what red team's find see

729
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,070
problems found in the sort of core

730
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,169
mathematics in the way a product is

731
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,629
built in the way it gets applied it's

732
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:27,820
emergent security properties in a system

733
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,950
context and then in real life how bad

734
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,340
things can be can be made to happen and

735
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,840
it was startling right so I worked as a

736
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,250
technical person primarily worked as a

737
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,049
manager for a third and then spent the

738
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,940
last third of my career both as a

739
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:41,168
manager but also looking at all this in

740
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,690
the one what in the world is going on

741
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:44,770
here why are we seeing the same things

742
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,070
over and over again that's what kept

743
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,690
striking me so and we did the good

744
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,100
things right the red team we found a

745
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,110
problem we told them we gave them power

746
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,820
point we told them exactly what we

747
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,250
exploited we gave them the Microsoft

748
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:01,360
patch number to fix those problems

749
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,740
almost never got fixed and you could

750
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,178
draw a quick conclusion right and some

751
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,520
military senior people I doubt what did

752
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:09,850
o our defenders are lazy they don't care

753
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,860
for untrained and I my response was you

754
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,110
know any Enterprise of any size like the

755
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,209
Defense Department that puts their fate

756
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,189
into the hands of 20 year old tech

757
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,950
school graduates is guilty of bad

758
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,450
strategy right so you know I've been

759
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,919
meetings for the general wants to fire

760
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,299
the private who failed to put in the

761
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,190
patch that was exploited blah blah blah

762
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,929
I said that's the same by the way

763
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,299
general that's the same private that

764
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,980
suppose you'd ask you for two hours of

765
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,900
downtime so he could update the mail

766
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,789
server I can't do that that's mission

767
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,340
essential we must have the menu so we're

768
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:41,890
taking our lowest paid youngest least

769
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,530
loves right most under-equipped part of

770
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,200
the workforce giving them conflicting

771
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:50,918
requirements and expecting them to save

772
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,260
us running incredibly complex incredibly

773
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,909
fragile technology that was never

774
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,809
designed for the kind of things that we

775
00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:00,220
put it through that's bad strategy and

776
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,678
you know it's not the way to really

777
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,990
think about this problem so knowing

778
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,539
about the flaws themselves is not enough

779
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,850
to get them fixed right and yet most of

780
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,220
our business is geared to this this sort

781
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:15,428
of breathless drama of revealing the red

782
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,460
team result of exposing the zero day

783
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:21,669
right of this sort of publicity

784
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:24,730
generating you know heroic cleverness to

785
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:27,519
find flaws and yet history tells us that

786
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,559
doesn't get them fixed by itself and why

787
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,970
is that what's because that's not why

788
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,740
people make those decisions right

789
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,470
sometimes you can embarrass people into

790
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,710
fixing things but if you want to get to

791
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,210
the real root cause then you have to

792
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,950
think more strategically about these

793
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,899
problems so people would say hey the red

794
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,700
team told them what to do they're good

795
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:47,469
people they even told them the Microsoft

796
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,809
patch number to put in place to stop

797
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,539
them right but anyone who thought about

798
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,100
this and I know you all have fixing that

799
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:55,749
patch what happens the next time the red

800
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,509
team comes they just come somewhere else

801
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:00,249
or someone undoes that patch because

802
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:03,970
they couldn't install some application

803
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:07,929
right so the notion was the thing that

804
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:11,200
got exploited doesn't get fixed at its

805
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:13,690
root right fundamentally except at a

806
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,440
different place in a different point in

807
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:20,379
the life cycle that is if you can't

808
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,080
manage configuration changes at scale

809
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:25,119
across a complex enterprise then it

810
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,889
doesn't matter if you fix the one patch

811
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,889
the one hole the one configuration

812
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:31,389
change because it'll get undone or lost

813
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:34,600
in the noise of all these other changes

814
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:36,850
and yet and here's a fact of all the red

815
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,189
teamers that work for us in NSA that

816
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,899
group is 150 people by the way right not

817
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,269
a one of them that I ever met had ever

818
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:45,758
run a network bigger than would fit in a

819
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,200
couple of desks right that's not why we

820
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,360
hired them that's not why we train them

821
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,240
they didn't speak the language of system

822
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,100
administration so they didn't know how

823
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,659
to convey what they learned right what

824
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,908
they pointed out what they discovered

825
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:59,919
they didn't know how to translated into

826
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:02,019
the language of better system

827
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,360
administration it's not their fault and

828
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:06,639
yet we treated that information so

829
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,758
closely that people that did understand

830
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,019
it weren't authorized to hear the story

831
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,850
now the blue team work for me right and

832
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,260
the red team would find these problems

833
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,669
team would be tasked to go fix them

834
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,620
working for me but they weren't

835
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:20,590
authorized to hear what the red team had

836
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,050
found is that sound ridiculous yeah

837
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,980
that's right it was true and I said one

838
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,810
day they're both going to work for me

839
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,190
and I'm gonna fix that problem I me put

840
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,870
the same manager in charge of them and

841
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,820
will hold them accountable to see the

842
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,469
problems get fixed because pointing them

843
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,780
out is just part of the life cycle right

844
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,940
at the end of day we need to fix things

845
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,290
but that was one of the great lessons

846
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,540
for me that information cyber defense is

847
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,310
really an information management game

848
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,440
it's not a technology game it's about

849
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,020
buying the best box it's about moving

850
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,730
information from where it's created to

851
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,920
where it's needed and in a form in which

852
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,660
it's needed so that example I gave you

853
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,190
of the red team finds it right it

854
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,370
creates information that finds an

855
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:03,190
exploitation the challenge was to move

856
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,590
it to the place where it's needed ie the

857
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,180
system administrators in the form and a

858
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,040
language in which it's needed the

859
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,150
language of configuration control and

860
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,879
management across the complex

861
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,890
distributed enterprise and what I did I

862
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,230
did a quick study fifty percent of what

863
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,710
the red team's would find could not be

864
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:24,190
fixed by the system owner to ask them to

865
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,960
come in fifty percent why well because

866
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,520
they would you and say well we we walked

867
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,660
right through your perimeter mr. system

868
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,310
owner and they go thank you your guys

869
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,190
are really clever it was it was wide

870
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:35,500
open why because we would work on this

871
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,150
DoD network but the premise router is

872
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,590
the big routers at the edge we're not

873
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,480
actually run by them I was run by DISA

874
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:43,240
right so it's a the equivalent of their

875
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,580
internet service provider and guess what

876
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,530
this is criteria was I want to cut the

877
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,600
number of human beings i have to pay so

878
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,330
the routers are all wide open okay

879
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,429
that's very cheap to run it's not very

880
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,080
good security though so you can tell

881
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,300
this or you can tell the system owner

882
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,610
this is your problem but they can't do

883
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,960
anything about it in fact if they're

884
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,189
really clever and most of them were they

885
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,020
had already told this at please don't

886
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,180
run my premise routers wide open right

887
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,129
you're leaving the exposed all right so

888
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,480
so you couldn't fix it a number of

889
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,250
problems that they found we're really a

890
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,050
function of DoD policy they had to do it

891
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,610
that way because of the policy so if you

892
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,260
didn't tell the policy Baker they had

893
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,760
made a mistake right you couldn't tell

894
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,710
the system owner you had until somebody

895
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,110
else and then a quarter of the problems

896
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,480
were only fixable really by the vendor

897
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,290
if you didn't tell the vendor you could

898
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,750
never solve

899
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,760
problem at the root cause level so this

900
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,910
information management then is really

901
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,950
the nature of successful cyber defense

902
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,440
not technology and it's not about

903
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,170
information sharing right the only thing

904
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,030
that legislators can agree upon in

905
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,770
Washington a is threat sharing right

906
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,480
we're the press legislation to encourage

907
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,670
threat sharing and protect a profession

908
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,130
you know why they agree to that because

909
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,390
it's viewed as harmless right it's like

910
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,100
motherhood and apple pie right sharing

911
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,920
is good therefore we should share more

912
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,870
threats you know when I talk to public

913
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,860
audiences ninety-nine point nine percent

914
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,750
of what you need to know to defend

915
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,939
yourself you already have in the public

916
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,070
you don't need any other threat feeds

917
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,540
frankly you don't need any double top

918
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,009
secret information from the US

919
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,639
government believe me I live in that

920
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:14,980
stuff it's in the public already right

921
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,100
the challenge is not getting more stuff

922
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,560
into your inbox the verb to remember is

923
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,830
translate how do you translate millions

924
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,929
of data points into a small number of

925
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,870
positive constructive things you can do

926
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,250
that's the real fundamental challenge of

927
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,690
cybersecurity rights an information

928
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,969
management problem a translation problem

929
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,950
so whenever people say threat sharing I

930
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,049
always say no translation is the problem

931
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:40,270
not the sharing itself yeah sharing is

932
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,190
good we all salute it's lovely we want

933
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,168
to share we want to learn but for the

934
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,780
vast majority of consumers adopters

935
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:49,150
enterprises translation is the problem

936
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,940
and here's an observation most federal

937
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,490
agencies can't do that most enterprises

938
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,679
can't do that take smart people access

939
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,629
to information a lot of scale a lot of

940
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,920
time translation into action so we'll

941
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,750
talk about what we're doing about that

942
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,970
next thing remember is the bad guy

943
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,560
doesn't perform magic all right a lot

944
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,720
there's still a sort of a romance to

945
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,400
this business you know this is about

946
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,959
wizards and the scruffy looking person

947
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,970
in the room I won't name any names here

948
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,530
must be the smartest person so we have

949
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,649
to hire them and if you treat this as

950
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:20,190
wizardry what's your only defense hire

951
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,030
young Wizards right you have no choice

952
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,620
bad guys are good at what they do

953
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,720
believe me like I'm one of the few

954
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,960
defenders that lived in an offense

955
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,910
organization for 35 years right so

956
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,440
defender who gets to live and breathe

957
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,480
and tranq cross train people and move

958
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,220
them back and forth across the biggest

959
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,860
attack machine you know really in the

960
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,839
world and so

961
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,280
you learn a lot from that you learned

962
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,900
that they are good but they don't do

963
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,610
magic they have a boss they have a

964
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,680
budget right they don't like to take

965
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,780
risks they like to be pretty certain

966
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,990
that what they do is going to work so

967
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,640
they can be very cautious so let me

968
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,509
offer you a little free content here if

969
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,790
you have a good next time you go to

970
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:01,720
youtube look at look for these search

971
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:06,700
terms a guy named Rob Joyce our OB Jo

972
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,470
yce with this acronym t a o de tailored

973
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,720
access operations Rob Joyce ta oh

974
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,459
there's a 40 minute video on there was

975
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,339
of the Rob delivered that's Rob's a

976
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,480
friend of mine still at NSA it's 40

977
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,480
minute video given it the Enigma

978
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,220
conference I think a year or so ago it's

979
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,950
the most underappreciated video in the

980
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,509
business right now I think Rob is the

981
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,509
director of tailored access operations

982
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,130
think of them I offer no official

983
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,020
verification of anything as the

984
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,570
organization outer outed by Edward

985
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,830
Snowden this is the attack machine of

986
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:40,360
the US government right at NSA and

987
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:43,840
basically the theme of his talk is how

988
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,240
to stop his teams and you will not hear

989
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,910
magic you won't hear you know this is he

990
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,100
didn't hold much back Franklin what you

991
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,370
will hear is professionalism patients

992
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,290
willingness to build infrastructure

993
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,600
willingness to wait for and a person on

994
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,130
the network to make a mistake

995
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:04,650
willingness to look for your weak points

996
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:08,590
or your week connections right no magic

997
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:11,440
skill professionalism patients yes no

998
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,630
magic if you could do what he recommends

999
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,100
that you do you're protected against the

1000
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,800
vast majority of attacks today without

1001
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,660
question okay and the things that Rob or

1002
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,340
telling you they're exactly what my

1003
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,810
nonprofit is telling you and I'll show

1004
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,580
you in a minute it's exactly the

1005
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,770
positive unclassified guidance coming

1006
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,180
out of NSA it's exactly the positive

1007
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,310
guidance coming out of the Australian

1008
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,470
ASD and lots of other places right

1009
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,029
there's no mystery to that we and by the

1010
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,799
way we all talk we all talk to each

1011
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,520
other raw friends swapping notes

1012
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,080
thinking about how to solve this problem

1013
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,370
so we don't do magic from the bad guy

1014
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,770
side we don't have to do it from the

1015
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,600
good guy side and then the last of the

1016
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,700
Pareto principle 8020 rule it really

1017
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,650
does apply in this space that is most of

1018
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,140
the you can get most of your value from

1019
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,120
a relatively small number of things

1020
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,980
not to solve the problem but to make

1021
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,509
most of your progress so the rule is

1022
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,010
basically eighty percent of your value

1023
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,220
comes from twenty percent of your inputs

1024
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,570
or your variables or whatever and so the

1025
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,430
key is though can you figure out what

1026
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,680
that that twenty percent is that's what

1027
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,649
you need to think about so the term I

1028
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,629
use for this so here's the irony of the

1029
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:16,230
business right i started in those

1030
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:20,010
monopoly days no market plays monopoly

1031
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,860
provider from the US government at this

1032
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,830
moment we have more tools training right

1033
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,600
technology things to help us as

1034
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:30,960
defenders than we've ever had in our

1035
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,180
history and yet we seem to be getting

1036
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,500
worse not better actually technically

1037
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,440
we're getting better but not nearly as

1038
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,780
fast as bad guys are getting better so

1039
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,550
what's going on here so we go from this

1040
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,720
monopoly situation that we talked about

1041
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,900
an i was trying to come up with some way

1042
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,600
to convey the complexity and the term i

1043
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,330
came up with was the fog of more okay

1044
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,640
what paralyzes people today or confuses

1045
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:58,440
them or miss directs them is too many

1046
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,359
choices right too many advice givers too

1047
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,560
many magical marketing claims from

1048
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,450
vendors too many conflicting overseers

1049
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,799
regulators you know people that want to

1050
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,000
know what you're doing expect you to

1051
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,480
prove that you've done the right thing

1052
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,420
in security it's overwhelming to figure

1053
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,640
out what to do that's what's paralyzing

1054
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,650
people today right it's a confusing time

1055
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,540
you don't know how to trust there's too

1056
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,900
many options too many vendors too many

1057
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,610
claims there's no way to sort this out

1058
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,130
on your own for the vast majority of

1059
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,990
enterprises so it's the difference here

1060
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,910
and the fog of more is actually a pun on

1061
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,439
the book the fog of war if any of you

1062
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,120
remember that we were all required to

1063
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,630
read that at one point in my NSA career

1064
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,069
it was talking about the impact on

1065
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,840
high-risk decision-making especially

1066
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,730
that's specifically war fighting right

1067
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,410
with the emergence of the information

1068
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:51,810
age so you're making decisions with

1069
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,970
amazingly dire consequences life and

1070
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:57,029
death consequences and you're doing it

1071
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:59,279
with rapidly changing information of

1072
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,380
uncertain that quality and confidence

1073
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,690
and you but you still have to make a

1074
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,519
decision right so how do you manage that

1075
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,140
really complex environment so

1076
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,658
term the author came up with the fog of

1077
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,759
war and I used more as a as a way to

1078
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,069
capture this this is the topic of my RSA

1079
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:16,049
talk in 2014 but for a lot of people

1080
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:17,669
helps capture for them why they are

1081
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:20,538
confused right they just don't quite get

1082
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:23,999
this so how do we get through all this I

1083
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:25,829
call this the the defenders dilemma the

1084
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:27,299
three-part challenge in front of you you

1085
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,429
have to figure out the right thing to do

1086
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,869
right I talked about that and how much

1087
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:33,569
to do because you don't have infinite

1088
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:37,019
resources everything in cyber security

1089
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:38,249
defense is about prioritization it

1090
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,379
doesn't matter how much money you have

1091
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:41,399
or how little it's all about

1092
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,319
prioritization of your actions of your

1093
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,819
funding and then you have to actually do

1094
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:47,189
it and by that I mean convince the boss

1095
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:48,509
get a budget pick the right to a lot of

1096
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:50,819
the marketplace implement it

1097
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:52,649
operationalize it do all that but the

1098
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:55,079
most insidious most challenging of all

1099
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:56,219
is number three you have to prove to

1100
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,659
others that you've done the right thing

1101
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,130
and you're going to have to do this over

1102
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:01,289
and over and over again I mentioned

1103
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,380
auditors insurance companies right

1104
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,509
regulators folks like that they think of

1105
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,029
them as enforcers right their job is to

1106
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:12,359
verify or validate what you have done

1107
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:14,579
but this is more pervasive than that we

1108
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,619
are all every institution is now part of

1109
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,599
a complex supply chain right from a

1110
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,239
Walmart to an automotive manufacturer

1111
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,569
they have thousands of supply chain

1112
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,399
partners integrated into their supply

1113
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:28,979
chain their development cycle their

1114
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:31,169
production line etc to make that work

1115
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:34,529
you have to have IT that integrates all

1116
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:39,419
this together ie you have to share data

1117
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:42,209
and control paths right in a really

1118
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:43,739
complex way oh and by the way if you're

1119
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:46,319
a supplier to walmart for example and

1120
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:48,269
you know the notion is you have access

1121
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,880
to certain data because no one wants to

1122
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:53,848
store stuff in a warehouse too expensive

1123
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,369
wasteful so therefore the agreement is

1124
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:57,829
on the walmart stores when the the

1125
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:59,789
inventory gets below a certain level

1126
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:01,169
just ship it directly from the

1127
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:03,689
manufacturer don't stick we're not

1128
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:04,919
sticking on a warehouse and moving it we

1129
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:07,019
want to come directly from the

1130
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:09,808
manufacturer so the contract is so that

1131
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:11,848
you know on your own when the inventory

1132
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:13,589
gets too low that triggers a message

1133
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:16,439
right which triggers then action to

1134
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:19,480
bring information highly efficient very

1135
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:22,210
cost effective but now you're sharing IT

1136
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,810
at some level so you have to have some

1137
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:28,780
measure of trust right I have to develop

1138
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,490
trust around that purpose I have to I

1139
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,590
don't know what I have to identify what

1140
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,660
data is needed what control pads and

1141
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:37,060
then how do I make that work in a way

1142
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,009
that doesn't undo my business model

1143
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,509
right think of some of the big hacks

1144
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,220
that have happened like target by H you

1145
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,050
know you've got your bringing suppliers

1146
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,520
where you don't know much about their

1147
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,840
security or the way they protect

1148
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,140
information or the way they deal with

1149
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:53,410
their credentials into your environment

1150
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,270
so a subcontractor should have might

1151
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,950
need access to certain parts of your

1152
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,390
environment does that mean they need

1153
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,089
access to your point-of-sale terminals

1154
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:03,490
not likely or to your back room

1155
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,920
accounting not likely right so you have

1156
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,049
to as an IT person figure out how to

1157
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,940
make this work and then protect against

1158
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,100
it so that how do I demonstrate to

1159
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,080
others I've done the right thing so this

1160
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,200
is going to happen over and over and

1161
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,670
over again at every scale so this is

1162
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,700
what really drives the business now in

1163
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,530
the future and I call this trust is gone

1164
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,868
from a binary condition remember where I

1165
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,250
grew up right cleared or not trusted by

1166
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:29,530
the US government or you're not you're

1167
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:33,160
my Ally or you're not to this world

1168
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:36,010
where trust is dynamically renegotiated

1169
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,080
over and over again around very specific

1170
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,150
purposes okay for in the business

1171
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,400
context i can actually came up with this

1172
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,590
in war fighting I call the tonys three

1173
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,090
rules of war as you'll forget me then

1174
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:49,330
you'll you'll immediately know why I was

1175
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,980
I should never have been in uniform Tony

1176
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,080
three rolls of war number one we never

1177
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,440
go to war without our friends okay

1178
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,520
that's that's us doctrine right think of

1179
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,600
coalition we're fighting in the Middle

1180
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,090
East not kind of stuff I'm never going

1181
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,259
to war without reference number two we

1182
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,600
don't know who our friends are until the

1183
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,970
day before we go to war right if you

1184
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,609
ever watch those politically you know

1185
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,919
politics watcher this is not the happy

1186
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,750
kumbaya Coalition of the Willing moving

1187
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,300
forward right this there's a mix of

1188
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:20,350
arm-twisting and bribery and cajoling

1189
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,480
and convincing to get all this to come

1190
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,069
together at the last minute often and

1191
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,600
that was literally happened in some of

1192
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,010
the conflicts the Middle East so you

1193
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,029
never know who you're young you don't go

1194
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,810
to war without your friends you don't

1195
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,560
know who they are until the day before

1196
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:34,240
and the third is after your friend

1197
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,660
can't stand each other and they

1198
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,680
certainly don't trust you okay so these

1199
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:43,660
are complex coalition's brought together

1200
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,200
to do some of the most dangerous work on

1201
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,120
earth right fight wars which means you

1202
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,310
can think of the IT challenge now how do

1203
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,930
you do that successfully well if all

1204
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,730
these nations can't tell who the good

1205
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,129
guys are from the bad guys you got

1206
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,200
problems okay because your bomb in the

1207
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:02,010
wrong people and so you're trying to

1208
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,330
combine these forces in a logical way

1209
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,160
that you achieve an objective and yet

1210
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,420
keep everybody safe that's the war

1211
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,190
fighting equivalent of the business

1212
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,890
challenge right so we trust each other

1213
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,380
but only for that purpose only for a

1214
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,210
given amount of time only for the data

1215
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,680
and control that we have agreed upon in

1216
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,470
order for us to execute that purpose

1217
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,430
that's the nature of this business now

1218
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:26,220
is how do we establish that kind of

1219
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:29,830
environment where that can be done

1220
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,819
quickly efficiently cheaply so I'm

1221
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,650
working with the number of vendors like

1222
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,630
Walmart and others who are trying to

1223
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:40,810
figure out how do I assess the security

1224
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:42,610
of several thousand sub suppliers right

1225
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,190
as cheaply and as quickly as possible

1226
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,420
and if one of them can't meet my cost I

1227
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,480
kick them out and I bring the next one

1228
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,970
in and so I could do the same for them

1229
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,980
very dynamic and very challenging so uh

1230
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,850
in the interest of time I'm going to

1231
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:00,160
skip over a couple of things so you'll

1232
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,420
but I will say this you can't survive as

1233
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,629
long as I have in this business without

1234
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,420
being one of two personality types

1235
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:09,220
complete cynic hopeless optimist right

1236
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,630
and the cynic has something to pick on

1237
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,399
every day in this business right some

1238
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,690
bad thing had happened it's great if you

1239
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,010
like because I know people in SA have

1240
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,600
made their entire careers around being

1241
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:20,740
cynical you've met many of them about

1242
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,910
nothing no names and that's good we need

1243
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,979
people who you know sort of

1244
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,270
truth-tellers and you know coyote people

1245
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,850
if you know that lower and all that kind

1246
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:29,200
of stuff but if we're gonna make real

1247
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,089
progress we need lots of hopeless

1248
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,160
optimist to belief that we can change

1249
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,450
things so things are changing i

1250
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,819
mentioned most of this already right I

1251
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,069
mean number of us grew up in the days

1252
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,300
where we had to actually G only we care

1253
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,950
about security how come no one else

1254
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,170
cares about it well now everybody cares

1255
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,660
about right it's popular magazine fodder

1256
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:49,020
it's headlines so you can't help

1257
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,980
but at least be aware at some level

1258
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,930
institutions are motivated i remember

1259
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,460
you know i mentioned to you the who

1260
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,790
wants to hear from me now is all these

1261
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,110
really social institutions all these

1262
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,820
things are starting to go into motion

1263
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,440
resources there's talent there's great

1264
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,210
centers like this i mean it's when the

1265
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,560
pioneering educational centers and there

1266
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,150
is better technology I don't want to

1267
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,950
tell you there's a rosy future ahead but

1268
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,660
there is now there's some reasons for

1269
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,060
optimism here so here's what I'm doing

1270
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,799
about it enough I'll finish up here so

1271
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,410
all these observations over all this

1272
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,970
time you know I've retired four years

1273
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:24,520
ago on a lark frankly it one afternoon

1274
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:28,290
the most frequent question I was getting

1275
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,870
in the mid-2000s was what do i do first

1276
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:32,920
okay that's one of the fog questions

1277
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,330
there's a thousand things out there the

1278
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,010
security guidance said by the way NSA

1279
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:38,650
started releasing security guidance to

1280
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,840
the public in 2001 and I was the manager

1281
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,800
who did led that campaign right I didn't

1282
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,530
do it because we're just nice people

1283
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,270
that we are nice people at NSA we did it

1284
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,650
because we recognize we're all in this

1285
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,390
together right there's no boundary for

1286
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,400
the DoD anymore no one gets moved or

1287
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,620
paid or uniformed without commercial

1288
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,210
friends so we have to get help everyone

1289
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,029
get better but in 2008 the question was

1290
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,530
what do i do first and I would say oh

1291
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,850
there's the NSA security guidance and

1292
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,320
the NIST has some good stuff and you can

1293
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,420
go ahead no no no got it that's

1294
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,220
thousands and thousands of pages and all

1295
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,620
this technical gobbledygook what do i do

1296
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,359
first what do i convince my boss up

1297
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,529
first where's my first dollar best spent

1298
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,600
whether we focus on for the first

1299
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,310
quarter and I just said gosh I never

1300
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,140
thought of it that's starkly before but

1301
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,910
that's that's reality for a lot of

1302
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,560
decision-makers right or a lot of

1303
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,870
security professionals trying to

1304
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,640
convince decision-makers you can't sell

1305
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,190
them on a 10 year program without some

1306
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,420
results you've got to bring focus and

1307
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,580
you can only keep so much of the bosses

1308
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,320
attention so what do i do first I

1309
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,490
gathered five friends in a room and

1310
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,370
these are not ordinary friends these are

1311
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:44,259
extraordinary friends representing the

1312
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:45,730
full range of knowledge at an NSA I said

1313
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,710
no one leaves the room till a small till

1314
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:51,100
we agree on a small number of things all

1315
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:53,140
of our friends should do not to solve

1316
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,100
world hunger not to create peace in our

1317
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,350
time because if you get enough security

1318
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,509
pros in the room what happens you will

1319
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,040
get an infinite to-do list right in

1320
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,930
incident list of problems and

1321
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,820
list of things to do that's not very

1322
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:08,560
helpful that's the best of fog problem

1323
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:10,480
ice it's a small means five to seven all

1324
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,850
of our friends should do these not to

1325
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,130
solve the problem but to get started to

1326
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,920
sort of lay the foundation for the rest

1327
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:20,170
of and you know you know this business

1328
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,510
nothing personal guys draws really

1329
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,380
bright to really opinionated people

1330
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,960
don't you don't have to look at anybody

1331
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,030
in this room they wouldn't leave the

1332
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,560
room until we agreed to 10 I couldn't

1333
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,500
bring them to five to seven so a list of

1334
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,790
10 on the two pieces on two pieces of

1335
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,310
paper went down to the Pentagon and a

1336
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:38,770
few friends that was it if you don't

1337
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,660
know where to begin start here just

1338
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,520
after noon lark never dreamed of it any

1339
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,560
bigger got a call several months later

1340
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,780
from the SANS Institute hey we have your

1341
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,390
list it's pretty good we'd like to build

1342
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,070
a project around it so they take it from

1343
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,240
five friends to five thousand friends on

1344
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,160
the mailing lists right most of whom

1345
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,410
don't know each other and they partner

1346
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,879
up with a nonprofit called the think

1347
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,950
tank called this Center for Strategic

1348
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,510
and International Studies and they

1349
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,029
create something originally named as the

1350
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:06,160
consensus audit guidelines better known

1351
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,860
as the sands top pointy and the idea was

1352
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,810
a this list of 20 most important things

1353
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,820
you could do based upon what bad guys

1354
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,320
are doing right not speculative but

1355
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,660
based on specific knowledge what bad

1356
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,220
guys are doing today how should I

1357
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,620
prioritize my actions one of the most

1358
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,540
importance of the things to do 2012 i

1359
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,430
wind up retiring from NSA go to the SANS

1360
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,410
Institute to run some special projects

1361
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,940
eventually took this back over spun it

1362
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:29,410
out into a non-profit company with some

1363
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,600
sponsorship from sands and some of the

1364
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,129
other companies in the business and it

1365
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,950
lives today in the center for internet

1366
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,930
security so this so I've chosen to spend

1367
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,819
the second act of my career focused on

1368
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,549
this what i would call operational

1369
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,990
practice you might think of it as what's

1370
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,200
the best we can do with what we've got

1371
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:49,240
available to us today right i'm glad you

1372
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,919
know spass shared some of the research

1373
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,689
summaries here there are people that

1374
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,570
need to solve some of these foundational

1375
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,550
harder problems absolutely but I've

1376
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,230
chose to focus on what can we do with

1377
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,610
what we have available to us today right

1378
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,070
what's on the shelf in the marketplace

1379
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:05,260
we know about because I think that's the

1380
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:08,020
8020 part of this the stuff where we can

1381
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,520
get a lot of return for a relatively

1382
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,230
modest amount of work and I'm not saying

1383
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,390
it's trivial right doesn't make it easy

1384
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,900
but for example the number of the

1385
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,150
official

1386
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,760
from the US cert right the US computer

1387
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:20,349
emergency response team is eighty-five

1388
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,900
percent of the incidents that they

1389
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:24,549
manage right scarce high-priced labor

1390
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,869
for the US government eighty-five

1391
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:28,420
percent of what they manage both by

1392
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:31,119
numbers of my time come down to

1393
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,000
basically hygiene problems failure to

1394
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,520
patch bad configurations terrible lack

1395
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,240
of zero network segmentation and no no

1396
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,059
separation of anything pretty normal

1397
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:44,890
basic good IT operational stuff that's

1398
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,240
their number everybody else who's ever

1399
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:48,460
studied this from the Gartner group

1400
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,930
semantics etc comes up with a number

1401
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,750
between eighty and ninety three percent

1402
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,618
of the problems that they track that

1403
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,599
they manage that they say come down to

1404
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,460
basically washing your hands getting

1405
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:01,930
your shots right not coughing on your

1406
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,329
name or kind of stuff pretty

1407
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,379
straightforward things so that's

1408
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,369
something where we can make a lot of

1409
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,920
progress that's where I've been spending

1410
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:10,180
my time I'll give you a reference as to

1411
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,369
how to find these things this is not a

1412
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,348
commercial you can tell I should my life

1413
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:15,849
in government right we this is all done

1414
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:17,589
with volunteer labor I'm the chief cat

1415
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:20,740
herder organizer community activist for

1416
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:21,970
this and then much to the surprise of

1417
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,879
many of my business friends we give it

1418
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,799
away for free so because it's created

1419
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,630
really through community labor alright

1420
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:30,880
that's the way I like to think of this

1421
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,230
we monetize it through some membership

1422
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,690
models and other things and you know

1423
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:36,039
other services and so forth but you know

1424
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,480
when you're operating in this model

1425
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,770
we're not trying to build a big company

1426
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,690
right we're trying to build a big

1427
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,520
community to pull all these things

1428
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,069
together when the other lessons for me

1429
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,509
is that if you want a good list of

1430
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:48,308
things to do you can go walk on any

1431
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,779
street corner in cyber security right

1432
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:52,270
you can find lots of magazine articles

1433
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:54,579
and go to NIST it again remember the

1434
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:57,190
knowing about a flaw doesn't get to fick

1435
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:59,200
doesn't get it fixed having a good list

1436
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,750
of things to do doesn't make them happen

1437
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,939
right there are great lists out there

1438
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:06,160
there's great information what's been

1439
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,660
missing i think is community building is

1440
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,629
identification of barriers we have in

1441
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,788
common of a non-profit to kind of go

1442
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:15,430
negotiate with the vendors right to help

1443
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:17,559
help them align their products along

1444
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,328
with the most important things to do so

1445
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:21,549
we're putting all that together now from

1446
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:23,020
the center for internet security and

1447
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:26,500
here's some of the things i'll mention

1448
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,730
briefly uh you know this has taken on a

1449
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,369
life of its own in the last

1450
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:32,020
couple three years so the big recent

1451
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:34,450
event for us was the California Attorney

1452
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:37,359
General data breach report came out in

1453
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:39,310
the last winter basically summarized and

1454
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,770
categorized all the data breaches in

1455
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:44,170
california since 2012 and recommendation

1456
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,940
number one was if you want to deal with

1457
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,460
this problem use the Center for net

1458
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,840
security critical controls much to my

1459
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,910
surprise I never met these people before

1460
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,100
they recommended it that caused more

1461
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,649
phone calls to come in to me asking me

1462
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,600
to explain it and me sheepishly saying I

1463
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,100
have no idea I think I better go

1464
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,930
introduce myself to the Attorney General

1465
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,240
California so last week I spend in

1466
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:06,460
California giving workshops there the

1467
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,399
concern of the Attorney General and it's

1468
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:12,609
a legit one in California is how can we

1469
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,859
help really small up to medium

1470
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:17,020
businesses deal with this problem

1471
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:18,880
because they can't deal with it they

1472
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,280
don't have budgets for this they don't

1473
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,270
have security staff for this there's no

1474
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,850
way they're going to do it on their own

1475
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:26,800
so we're retuning a lot of our content

1476
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,049
really to aim for these small businesses

1477
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,970
right rewrite them in plain English lots

1478
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,070
of pointers to free software lots of

1479
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,899
sort of community building to ban people

1480
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,890
together that are similarly situated so

1481
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,840
that they can learn from each other

1482
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:40,900
create use cases that kind of stuff so

1483
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,400
that's the stuff that we're doing we're

1484
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,710
in the NIST cybersecurity framework if

1485
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,850
you look at the tail end or the

1486
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,020
recommendations and the one of the

1487
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:50,140
things I spend a lot of time my time

1488
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,550
doing is talking to the big threat

1489
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,680
intelligence companies what are you guys

1490
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,990
seem right I don't get all their data I

1491
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,419
get summaries of their data and we map

1492
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:00,220
them into our control set to make sure

1493
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,540
that we're picking a good set so you can

1494
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,980
look in the recommendation section of

1495
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,320
the semantic document the verizon

1496
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,960
document HP solution airy Palo Alto a

1497
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,460
bunch of those that's just me and

1498
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,650
volunteers working with the authors of

1499
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,950
their reports to make sure their

1500
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,869
specialty is characterizing the problem

1501
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:19,660
our specialty is the translation right

1502
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:22,480
that problem I can I translate from

1503
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,890
summaries of bad things into a

1504
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,540
relatively small number of positive

1505
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,839
constructive things to do but

1506
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:31,390
importantly the other 3 i'll just point

1507
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:34,060
out a lot of these these are references

1508
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:36,759
or recommendations or folks that use our

1509
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,100
work now the rest of these are really

1510
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,839
not cyber geek institutions right the

1511
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,749
National Governors Association

1512
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:46,089
association of policing Zurich Insurance

1513
00:55:43,749 --> 00:55:48,129
you know other things CPI is a is a

1514
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:49,869
security one that from the UK but most

1515
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:51,670
of these again we're seeing the

1516
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:55,569
emergence of these social institutions

1517
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:56,859
trying to figure out what to do and of

1518
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:58,930
course they don't have security staffs

1519
00:55:56,859 --> 00:56:01,058
right there you know the Red Cross

1520
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:03,129
people like that that's this is not

1521
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:05,469
where they live so the good news is they

1522
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:07,119
look around for something to latch on to

1523
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:09,400
write and whether it's us or NIST or

1524
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,960
whatever that's all fine but that you're

1525
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,690
this is more evidence of the emergence

1526
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,680
of these social forces in motion that

1527
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,079
they're trying to make sense of this

1528
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,819
problem and do something about it so you

1529
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:20,920
know I'm part of the multi-state I sack

1530
00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:23,619
you know our center is actually a about

1531
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,450
a hundred people my part of it is

1532
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:29,140
actually very tiny either there's a tiny

1533
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:31,180
team that runs the critical controls

1534
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,769
project there's a bigger team that runs

1535
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,479
what's called the CIS security

1536
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:36,279
benchmarks which are the detailed

1537
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:38,468
configuration guides for like a Windows

1538
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:40,930
desktop and the patchy server exchange

1539
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:42,430
server that kind of stuff and so we have

1540
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,828
a wider range of things but I'm going to

1541
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,299
leave you with the contact information

1542
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:48,489
where you can get a dress for me

1543
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:50,049
directly or reach me through spam so so

1544
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:52,989
let me just summarize real quick and

1545
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:54,400
then after the recordings are where we

1546
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:57,160
glad to stick around for some time and

1547
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,289
take questions if you have any you know

1548
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,210
this has been the really the story of my

1549
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:03,430
career which has really been riding the

1550
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,170
wave that we now call cyber right so

1551
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,509
seeing it kind of initially as a

1552
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:09,549
technology project seeing at the

1553
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:11,229
national security level watching its

1554
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:14,109
emergence into all these other different

1555
00:57:11,229 --> 00:57:16,328
fields the different sort of us the ways

1556
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:19,239
that we view the security problem and

1557
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,950
then to see it become a basic factor in

1558
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,900
our economic and social health as

1559
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,879
citizens of the country so this is

1560
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,039
really an amazing journey from my

1561
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,170
perspective I feel really richly blessed

1562
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,369
to have been have the opportunity to be

1563
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,650
in the room for lots of the big

1564
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:35,200
decisions a big incidents that happen

1565
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,789
the big changes that occurred and that

1566
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,558
chance to share it back with folks like

1567
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:40,029
you so with that I'm going to wrap up

1568
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,710
and so thank you very much for your time

1569
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:44,309
and patience here late this afternoon

1570
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,309
thank

1571
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:47,400
you

1572
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,930
you
