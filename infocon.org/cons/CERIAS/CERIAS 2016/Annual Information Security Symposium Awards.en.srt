1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,879
so to kick off this morning one of the

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,549
things I really enjoy doing every year

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:18,869
as a as a university organization with

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,590
some history and a lot of moving parts

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:26,590
what we try to do is recognize

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,680
individuals who have contributed to the

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,619
mission of serious to the mission of

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,489
cyber security and privacy here at

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,390
Purdue and who have done things that we

10
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:42,570
would consider to be really outstanding

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,719
the first award that we give every year

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,600
we call the pillar of serious award and

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,390
this is given to an individual who over

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,070
a period of years has provided

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:00,039
outstanding support for our mission in

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,410
one way or another so sometimes this has

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,330
gone to our corporate partners sometimes

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,610
this has gone to faculty sometimes has

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,030
gone to our staff but these are

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,189
individuals who over a period of years

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,710
have continued to support what we do

22
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:17,589
sometimes without recognition and this

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,500
is a way for us to publicly thank them

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,320
and acknowledge what they've done this

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,740
year's award goes to someone who joined

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,309
us about a decade ago and has worked

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,890
tirelessly to help advance the cause of

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,560
not only the education aspects of the

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:40,180
the center but also the outreach and the

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,680
teaching and has pretty much always been

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,930
there whenever we've called and said we

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,460
need somebody can you rearrange your

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,430
schedule and the answer is almost always

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,979
yes and and that's an accomplishment

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,340
when you are a faculty member running

36
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,960
lots of projects and students and during

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,820
the last few years has also been running

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,460
the cyber Center at Discovery Park an

39
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,008
incredible number of achievements and

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,440
one of the most highly cited faculty

41
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,630
members we have in computer science or

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,269
insecurity in general here with the

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,489
university we have been so fortunate and

44
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,739
continue to be so fortunate to have

45
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,910
elisa bertino as a colleague and this

46
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,910
year's pillar of serious

47
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,799
as a spa side I was in Italy and what

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,319
reason I moved the era was because of

49
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,480
serious serious was a very worldwide

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,548
well known and that really was a very

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,578
excited about this opportunity I'm still

52
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,519
very excited today even more serious is

53
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:54,560
a great place to be and we have a lot of

54
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,750
sponsors with whom we do a lot of

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,139
exciting work a lot of students great

56
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,959
leadership so I don't know what I did to

57
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:17,209
deserve this award I'm very happy about

58
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:20,659
it thank you allah a second a word that

59
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:24,970
we give every year is called the diamond

60
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:28,280
award and this goes to a student who has

61
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:33,949
graduated or well will graduate by the

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:38,359
end of the summer session or or who's

63
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:41,620
already graduated basically and we

64
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,389
recognize this person as someone who has

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,750
overcome various kinds of difficulties

66
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:55,579
to succeed in an outstanding manner and

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,430
in studies here at serious and we issued

68
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:01,099
a call for nominations and got an

69
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:05,769
exceedingly long nomination of this

70
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:09,108
individual is a hardware nello here

71
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,549
forward so i'm not going to try and read

72
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,900
this all up and then keep you in

73
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,859
anticipation it because it will be

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,769
obvious but let me know here that says

75
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,289
are before he got here earned two

76
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,570
masters degrees in both robotics and

77
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:26,840
astronautics at the university of rome

78
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,229
and then came here to pursue further

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,810
studies working in astro arrow in the

80
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:36,590
area of systems of systems and

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:40,820
control and has done all of its course

82
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,979
work with the GPA of 40 which is a great

83
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,780
accomplishment for a graduate student

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,720
coming in although we had great great

85
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,599
preparation he's been a key member of

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,150
the research group over in the system of

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,710
systems and part of the challenges for

88
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,320
the work he's done in developing his

89
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,650
software and his algorithms has been the

90
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,780
fact that he doesn't he's not a US

91
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,789
citizen and so in Astro arrow and some

92
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,979
of security we have a set of

93
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,740
restrictions that make it difficult to

94
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,940
gain access to some of the data and

95
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,639
software that would make that possible

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,550
nonetheless his work has found its way

97
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,450
into those environments it has inspired

98
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,490
work he's gotten commendations from

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,880
there's this huge list of organizations

100
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,950
and people who recognized what he's done

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,919
in addition to working on his ph.d and

102
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:36,229
finishing that up he's also earned a

103
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:38,180
third masters in planetary geology and

104
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,180
with an interest I guess in spaceflight

105
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,810
and robotics and who knows where that's

106
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,410
going to take you but it's part of this

107
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,810
overall pattern of achievement he's had

108
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,610
a number of peer-reviewed papers where

109
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,220
he's been first author seven of those at

110
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,870
least for those of you who saw posters

111
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,070
here last year he was one of the poster

112
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,530
winners he's got some journal articles

113
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,860
that have just appeared and and in

114
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,359
general is just an astonishing scholar

115
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,700
one of the kinds of people that we are

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,840
so proud to have here and have as an

117
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,680
alumnus during some of the breaks take

118
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,690
some time say hello to Cesare and

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,639
congratulate him on his achievement

120
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,789
which is this year's serious diamond to

121
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,789
work

122
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:48,880
yeah and that was not by planning but I

123
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,789
guess that goes to show first of all we

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,950
have this very global reach to be able

125
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,920
to bring in students and faculty and and

126
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,840
visitors from all around the world we go

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,290
after the best expertise wherever it

128
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:08,109
resides and what we can't bring in we

129
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:11,080
produce so the third set of awards that

130
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,840
we give each year are based on the

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,090
poster session so any of you were here

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,690
last night had a chance to go through

133
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,419
and we had I think was 56 posters 57

134
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,660
posters of current research projects and

135
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,750
those those aren't all of our research

136
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,690
projects we probably have at least half

137
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,920
again as many that are active those are

138
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,140
the ones where the students were able to

139
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,970
take time out and produce posters to

140
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,469
describe what they're doing that we're

141
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,550
in a position where we could share with

142
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:47,260
all of you some of what's going on we

143
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,660
had a set of secret judges eyes are

144
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,940
still so secret can I ask them to to

145
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,170
stand up and identify themselves because

146
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,060
it was a lot of work we'd like to

147
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,930
acknowledge our judges so judges if

148
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,730
you're in the room stand up and thank

149
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,730
you we had four judges there two of them

150
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,220
and what they did is they went around

151
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,880
they identified those posters that look

152
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,220
to be particularly well-suited for

153
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,860
recognition evaluated them listen to the

154
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,310
students asked questions rank them and

155
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,190
then we came up with a set of awards

156
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,680
based on the posters and the students

157
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,390
presentation of those posters and what

158
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,930
we do is we present those students with

159
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,000
a certificate and there will be a small

160
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,390
cash prize that's provided by our

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,390
partners the certificate I'll give today

162
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,169
is is a placeholder we'll have the

163
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,240
actual one to give out probably next

164
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,210
week

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,810
let me also preface this by saying the

166
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,960
fact that I am also a faculty advisor to

167
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,030
