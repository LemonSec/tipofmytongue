1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:10,580
you won't hear anything okay let us know

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:13,400
when we're on standby and go ahead

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:17,990
please welcome to the serious security

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,080
seminar for March 30th 2016 today I'm

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,599
honored to introduce professor Chris can

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,000
ensue comes to us from the University of

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,859
Illinois at Chicago where he does work

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,019
in techno social aspects of security and

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,379
privacy he is trained as a computer

10
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:39,858
scientist but looks a lot at where

11
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:41,949
security and privacy issues go beyond

12
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:46,670
what we can simply address using

13
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:49,218
technical means he got his PhD at the

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,780
University of California San Diego where

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:55,850
he worked with Professor Stephan savage

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:01:02,440
recent recipient of the ACM Infosys

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:05,840
award and however before he went to UCSD

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,579
Chris was an undergraduate here at

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,430
Purdue so for any of you who are

20
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,770
undergraduates you know you do really

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,159
well studying well in security and look

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,460
where you can end up so with that Chris

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,990
yeah thanks very much Chris yeah if you

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,669
do all of those things as Chris

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,890
mentioned you could very happily come

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,250
back to purdue I'm very very happy to be

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,609
back here today to give you this talk

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:37,189
that I've entitled bottom line security

29
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:39,140
so as Chris mentioned i'm here from

30
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,990
beautiful chicago just a couple hours

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,409
away where I've been osmaston professors

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,669
since 2012 and this talk is really about

33
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,280
we're going to leave the bottom line

34
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,719
that's involved in security like what's

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,819
really going to be the most meaningful

36
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,829
thing that we can look at a socio

37
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,679
technical level just zoom out as far as

38
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,029
we possibly can from the things that

39
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:02,569
we're focusing on at a technical level

40
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:06,249
and really see those impacts at a at a

41
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:09,619
broader level so one really really quick

42
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:12,859
fun exercise that I like to do when you

43
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,720
do intro to computing type classes is if

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,170
somebody if an attacker if I

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,450
if a clever attacker sees this door with

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,399
all of these really really nasty laksana

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,810
what is the clever attacker going to do

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:31,610
when they are faced with this type of

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:33,520
defense anybody what's that break the

50
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,930
door break the door is definitely one

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,920
easy thing to say instead of looking at

52
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,050
those locks we're just gonna go after

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,850
that hinge right the clever attacker is

54
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,520
not going to worry about your defense

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,950
because their goal is not like oh I'd

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,200
really really want to be the first guy

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,700
to break this amazing pin padlock they

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,530
want to get to what's behind that door

59
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,299
so they can attack the hinge on that

60
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,400
door they don't even have to attack the

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:00,110
door itself they really just want to get

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,330
into that system and so this is one

63
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,790
point that I like to try to drive home

64
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,280
where defense is harder than offense we

65
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,769
need to place a perimeter around what

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
we're looking at and say what is it that

67
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,610
we really want to protect because we put

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,160
these mechanisms up but it's not the

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,180
security mechanism itself that the

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,230
attacker is interested in they're

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,170
interested in the thing that you're

72
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,359
actually trying to protect so a little

73
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,850
bit of what I've done in the past while

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,489
I was a PhD student at UC San Diego was

75
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,160
look at what these attackers are

76
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,540
actually trying to get and 11 easy thing

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,120
that we can say there's a lot of

78
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,890
attackers nowadays on the internet are

79
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,910
looking to make money they're looking to

80
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,649
turn some technical insight that they

81
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,200
have some hard work some intelligence

82
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,040
they have into an attack that can make

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,018
them money and one you know postulate

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,390
you could make is say listen in order to

85
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,489
create better security I'm going to find

86
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,130
out what attackers want and I'm going to

87
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,560
try to prevent them from getting to what

88
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,989
they want right if an attacker wants

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,690
money and they're going to use spam to

90
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,400
do it we can either filter the spam and

91
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,170
say oh you know there's a billions and

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,459
billions of messages we can do our best

93
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,260
to make sure those messages don't get

94
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,940
through or we can say well we're going

95
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,820
to make it harder for people that are

96
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,600
sending spam to take credit card

97
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,329
transactions and that is going to be

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,370
just as or possibly more effective than

99
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,870
doing something that a purely technical

100
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,610
level trying to prevent that spam

101
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,500
because it's not that the spammers want

102
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,400
to subvert your filter they just want to

103
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,699
make

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,590
make a dollar so this is a matter of

105
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,690
minimizing the upside to the attacker

106
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,369
that's one way that we can affect our

107
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:42,710
bottom-line security but there's so much

108
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,250
more going on than just span there's so

109
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,469
much more going on than just these

110
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,240
specific types of attacks there's so

111
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,180
much it's not just a matter oh there's a

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,490
door or a lock or hinge or a window when

113
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,550
you see the interconnectedness that we

114
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,320
have online today the UC ridiculous

115
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,180
numbers you see that facebook analyzes

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,099
graphs that have a trillion different

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,510
edges in them and that sounds really

118
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,460
really cool it's really great to be able

119
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,360
to do this data mining at that level but

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,039
when you start thinking with this

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,960
adversarial mindset you start thinking

122
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,870
about the security aspects of this you

123
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,909
say oh oh like there are billions of

124
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,130
different vectors that I need to be able

125
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,360
to defend against and try to sell is

126
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,560
there a way for them to make money this

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,510
way is there a way for them to gain an

128
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,860
advantage that way it becomes really

129
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:33,020
really tricky so the attacker ends up at

130
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,639
a advantage in this situation where they

131
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,310
are just going to be in a much better

132
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,020
situation than we are as the defenders

133
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,229
there's more of them than there are of

134
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,030
us and this becomes a resource

135
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,030
constraint a hard resource constraint we

136
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,849
as researchers as people who are trying

137
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,820
to do cybersecurity can only devote so

138
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,229
much time to preventing this attack or

139
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,919
preventing that attacker preventing the

140
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,840
next one we're fundamentally limited in

141
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,969
this way so what we've done in the past

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,770
and what we do a lot is we say okay

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,030
these are the attacks that an attacker

144
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,130
is going to try to do they're going to

145
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,289
try to infect a machine they're going to

146
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,690
try to exploit a vulnerability they're

147
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,570
going to try to knock a machine offline

148
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,729
via a DDoS attack and we can understand

149
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,300
a lot about how they do that why they do

150
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:25,310
that and minimize how much they how much

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,440
success that they're going to get but

152
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,320
what I posit is that the objective

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,789
function that we really care about oh

154
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm looking at right so the objective

155
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,570
function that we really care about is

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,330
that we want to actually minimize how

157
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,760
much harm comes to the defenders how

158
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,960
much harm comes to us and if we if we

159
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,190
look at our objective

160
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,750
function that way and say this is what

161
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,180
we're going to minimize we're going to

162
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,130
minimize the harm that comes to the good

163
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,080
guys not necessarily at a purely

164
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,599
technical level but at this larger socio

165
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,198
technical level then you're going to end

166
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,909
up with better bottom line security so

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,020
I'm going to go over a few projects that

168
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,080
we've done over the past couple of years

169
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,840
that start trying to take take a crack

170
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,729
at understanding how much of that harm

171
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,159
is coming to users so that we can use

172
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:13,940
that to build effective defenses that

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,800
give us a the right inputs to our

174
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,639
objective function so the first thing

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,070
we're going to look at here is

176
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,349
quantifying the harm that comes to our

177
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:28,880
users again we're looking at things in

178
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:31,280
terms of dollars lost days time that's

179
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,370
lost and data that is lost this one

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,080
we're going to look primarily at time

181
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,990
but we're also going to be able to turn

182
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,840
time into money with a couple you know

183
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,659
back of the envelope style calculation

184
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,539
so we're going to look at a crime a

185
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,360
relatively benign relatively like

186
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,159
marginal but still nonetheless tangible

187
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,050
and substantial and definitely in terms

188
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,210
of quantity cybercrime called typo

189
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,090
squatting so typo squatting is when you

190
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,638
know I decide like oh I want a lot of

191
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,679
people to visit my website and I don't

192
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,840
really care if they want to get to me I

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,250
just know that people are fallible and

194
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,989
if somebody decides they want to go to

195
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,680
Facebook they might instead type in FA

196
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,599
ECB oh okay instead of fh c eb o ok so i

197
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
know that as the cybercriminal i know

198
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,830
that that could possibly happen and i'm

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,710
going to take advantage of that to say

200
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,930
serve malware to serve a bunch of ads

201
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,340
that that person doesn't want to see and

202
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,530
there's been a lot of research China's

203
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,468
okay we need to detect this we need to

204
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:36,169
prevent this we need to make sure that

205
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:39,349
people are not the victims of this type

206
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,848
o squatting attack so what I would I

207
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,979
want to look at what my research group

208
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,430
has looked at on this is okay well how

209
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,350
can we model this as a harmful event and

210
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,229
how can we get a better understanding of

211
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,230
how much of that harm comes to the users

212
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,140
who are the victims of this cyber crime

213
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,010
and there's one way that you can look at

214
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,990
this is the harm that comes to the the

215
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,670
provider of the service the site that

216
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,830
use that might have gotten a visitor but

217
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,920
then didn't so they lose a visitor to

218
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,830
their website another one is I am a user

219
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,000
who comes to that website and I instead

220
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,130
of going to where I wanted to go I went

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,530
to someplace else so in this case the

222
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,530
user typed something incorrectly they

223
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,270
might end up at an browser error page

224
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,250
because the domain hadn't been

225
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,770
registered yet they might end up at a

226
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,720
site that's just full of ads I'm a

227
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,390
really nasty one that we worry about

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,280
here is that they might end up at a

229
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,380
phishing page or page it serves them

230
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,569
malware because this is somebody who

231
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,790
wanted a visitor to come to their

232
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,350
website and not necessarily a legitimate

233
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,810
visitor that actually wanted to engage

234
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,200
in business with that person who was

235
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,180
impersonating Facebook and so what would

236
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,250
usually happen in this model is the

237
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,319
person goes to that website there's a

238
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,180
reasonable chance probably hopefully a

239
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,220
very high chance that they realize they

240
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,939
were at the wrong website they correct

241
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,680
their mistake and they end up at

242
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,500
facebook.com/ what we really want to

243
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,750
happen is we want to make sure that we

244
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,780
minimize the attacks that happen here

245
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,490
that final option right where somebody

246
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,530
goes to a site that has malware on it or

247
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,830
that has fishing on it that is

248
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,890
definitely a bad thing we could put some

249
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,690
dollar value on that but what we found

250
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,340
in a previous research that I'm not

251
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,080
going to talk about too much today we

252
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,850
looked at typo squatting through lots

253
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,860
and lots of different websites just

254
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,240
trying to see looking at millions and

255
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,030
millions of domains trying to find how

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,420
prevalent is typo squatting both on very

257
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,209
popular domains but also on less popular

258
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,949
sites there's the long tail of lots and

259
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,990
lots of websites and or smaller sites

260
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,420
local sites how much type of squatting

261
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,190
is being perpetrated by and on those

262
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,360
sites we actually found that there

263
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:58,230
aren't that many of the prevalence of

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,940
malice like fishing or malware on these

265
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,400
sites which are performing the typo

266
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:08,340
squatting was less common than in some

267
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,150
random choice of reasonably popular site

268
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,040
so if anybody familiar

269
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,480
with the Alexa 1,000,000 we found that

270
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,060
there's a higher prevalence of malware

271
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,800
in the Alexa 1,000,000 the 1 million

272
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,160
most popular sites on the internet

273
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,319
versus the sites which we're doing this

274
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,160
type o squatting so we found with mainly

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,590
what these sites are doing is they're

276
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,329
monetizing sites via throwing a bunch of

277
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,010
ads in front of people it's very very

278
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,020
rare for these sites to actually be

279
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,180
doing something malicious which makes

280
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,670
sense so what we're looking at here is

281
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,449
how much malice and there's not going to

282
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,219
be too much of this high value problem

283
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,780
those things get stomped out relatively

284
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,630
quickly the main harm we posit here on

285
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,300
the user side is that lost time that you

286
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:58,980
get simply from being a victim of this

287
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,530
attack so what we were able to do in

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,270
this situation was what we want to say

289
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,560
well we need to find some better way to

290
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,939
look at these attacks and find them

291
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,160
actually happening and where this tat

292
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,810
attack is simply like I have on this

293
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,360
slide here where there's a person who

294
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,219
goes to website a because they made a

295
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,190
mistake they correct that mistake and

296
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:25,650
then they end up going to website V so

297
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:28,200
we built this up we built a model to

298
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,540
look at the behavior we built a model

299
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,000
out of that idea that this is how people

300
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,500
are going to end up going to these types

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,580
of websites so we said listen we have

302
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,910
access to a very large number of

303
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,040
anonymized web a very large amount of

304
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,770
anonymized web traffic and we're simply

305
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,170
going to say let's look at every single

306
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,510
visit that any of these users does to a

307
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,189
home page of any old website either

308
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,930
trying to go to something that doesn't

309
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:59,000
exist at all or trying to go to a

310
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,589
website that is relatively close in the

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,360
lexicographic distance to the actual

312
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,290
site that somebody wanted to go to and

313
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,840
so we looked for three times in our data

314
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,670
set of I don't remember exactly what are

315
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,620
billions of web requests so we had a

316
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,750
data set of a few billion different web

317
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,080
requests we looked at okay in all of

318
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,710
those how many of them were 33 seconds

319
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,780
or less

320
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,030
part how many of them were relatively

321
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,829
close together lexicographically and

322
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,390
happened a reasonable number of times so

323
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,170
that we can actually see that this is a

324
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:37,800
trend as opposed to just a spurious

325
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,449
one-off situation and so with this just

326
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,890
model we're just describing what we're

327
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,090
looking for then we look through our

328
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,340
data set of about a billion different

329
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,460
views and we were able to find a very

330
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:51,420
large number of typo domains not purely

331
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,340
based on the fact that they were close

332
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,740
together lexicographically but any sort

333
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,270
of event there we filtered it to that

334
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,100
lexicographic distance to make the

335
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,140
problem a little bit easier for us and

336
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,350
we were actually able to find not only

337
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,680
the fact that some somebody visited say

338
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,380
'hey be a calm and then went to EV ebay

339
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,540
com with a ninety percent probability

340
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,730
but also say okay well even if something

341
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,640
is lexicographically similar to

342
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,440
something else we can lower our false

343
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,090
positive rate by saying oh even though

344
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,140
these are close together and somebody

345
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,220
visits this site and there's a

346
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,650
reasonable chance that they're going to

347
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,240
fit is going to visit this other site

348
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,459
right after they visit this first one

349
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,100
they aren't a typo squad at each other

350
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,730
because they don't happen in this

351
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:41,850
correlated fashion so purely passive or

352
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:44,160
a purely you know data-driven so a

353
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,640
purely just looking at the lexicographic

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,370
data you wouldn't be able to find this

355
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,760
behavioral correlation that we found in

356
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,800
this in this data set so we rate once we

357
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,110
have this idea of what are these

358
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,060
different typo squats that actually

359
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,610
happen not only do we have the idea that

360
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,310
oh we actually do see this EBA calm and

361
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,230
it's ebay com and lots of users that

362
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,369
went to this site there's a very very

363
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,530
high chance that they meant to go this

364
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,870
other site we can say we have these

365
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,360
typos squatting events and we have the

366
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,330
time frame that they happen so we can

367
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,700
actually say at time T equals 0 the user

368
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,130
typed this thing in at time T equals 1

369
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,830
the user typed this next thing and to go

370
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,050
to a different site and they ended up

371
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,070
where they wanted to or they didn't and

372
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,010
they had to go and look at some other

373
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,030
site so we were able to question yes how

374
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,600
you collect this data this is anonymized

375
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,160
data

376
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:44,279
we got on a tap on a moderate-sized

377
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,040
University Network I I can answer more

378
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,730
questions at that point but this is

379
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,339
anonymized IRB approved

380
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,470
privacy-preserving research with best

381
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,779
practices both on the security and the

382
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,149
privacy side but that's a very very

383
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:04,589
important question thank you for asking

384
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:06,690
me on that so looking at these typos so

385
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:11,819
now we have these 34,000 different

386
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:13,949
events that we're looking at and we want

387
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,750
to say okay like how do these actually

388
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,790
work are there different motifs that we

389
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,259
can look at and understand what is

390
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,630
happening in this situation so one of

391
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,790
them we see our adversarial

392
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,189
registrations so we characterize

393
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,980
adversarial registrations as ones where

394
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,630
the initial miss type of some domain is

395
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,519
not connected in any way through they're

396
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,670
not registered together they don't

397
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,240
forward to each other they aren't

398
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,829
registered by a brand protection agency

399
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,439
these are sites that are going to have a

400
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:48,779
reasonable a non-negligible chance of

401
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,000
being malicious of simply being a part

402
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,189
site full of ads we also looked at

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,439
cooperative registrations which are the

404
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:57,660
ones where you see brand protection or

405
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:00,480
simply owning multiple sites that could

406
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,819
be typos of each other and using those

407
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,459
to say this is cooperative what those

408
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,480
sites will usually do they might say oh

409
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,179
you've got to the site in error please

410
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,720
click here to go to the real yahoo com

411
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,400
instead of yahoo com or they simply do

412
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,559
that automatically through your their

413
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,199
browser and then the third are also very

414
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,408
common instance here is that the domain

415
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,110
simply isn't registered so looking at

416
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:26,520
these three different types of typos

417
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,760
that you can see a user could go through

418
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,470
any one of these three different typos

419
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,289
depending on what it was they typed

420
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,919
incorrectly so we can see here we've got

421
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:40,890
this blue line is the CDF of the delay

422
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,419
from getting from what you mistyped to

423
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,130
what you were trying to get to if you

424
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,549
were going through a cooperative

425
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:49,230
registration the chequered line is

426
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,980
adversarial registrations and the red

427
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,990
line is

428
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,160
registered domain so you typed in

429
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,230
something that just simply didn't exist

430
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,490
your browser gave you an error page and

431
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,470
you moved on to where you're trying to

432
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,840
go to the first thing that we see in

433
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,790
this data is that there's a huge

434
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,889
difference between these cooperative

435
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,299
registrations and everything else and

436
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,150
this makes sense when a computer can

437
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:12,120
correct this mistake for you it can do

438
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,440
so very very quickly the long tail there

439
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,750
where eighty percent of them happen

440
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,010
immediately the the long tail ends up

441
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,070
being where there is something that is

442
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,620
registered but it requires the user to

443
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,970
do some sort of input some sort of

444
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,418
interaction and that causes something

445
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:30,600
that's cooperative to still cause some

446
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,910
delay the so that number there's a very

447
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,439
big difference between those two stats

448
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,820
but actually when we look at the

449
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,710
difference between the adversarial

450
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,168
registrations and things that are simply

451
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:45,270
unregistered there is a very small

452
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:47,280
difference between those two steps so

453
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,370
this is basically saying if somebody

454
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,040
pops up a whole bunch of ads in front of

455
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,168
a user or if if someone just props up an

456
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,270
error message one of those isn't causing

457
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,970
a user to waste more time than the other

458
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,280
one this isn't a harmful this isn't a

459
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,020
substantially damaging attack to just

460
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,570
throw a bunch of ads in front of

461
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,190
somebody they just they will find the

462
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,500
site that they're going to at roughly

463
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,910
the same in roughly the same amount of

464
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,260
time the other situation that we're

465
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,419
going to look at not only are we looking

466
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,129
at how long it takes a user to get to

467
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,580
the site that they wanted to get to but

468
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,230
we also want to look at the success rate

469
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,110
of the user finding what they're trying

470
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,850
to get to of trying to find out how

471
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,918
often will the user who miss types this

472
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,360
domain because with RB hate with our

473
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,370
intent inference technique that we

474
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,049
talked about earlier we can know that

475
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,580
there's a really really strong chance

476
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,740
that somebody who went to this super

477
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,720
unpopular website that is a Miss type of

478
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,710
a relatively popular website we knew

479
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,730
that they were trying to get to the

480
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,010
intended website we know what they were

481
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,660
trying to do so we can say oh in the

482
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,080
chain the situations where they didn't

483
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:57,900
get to where they were trying to go we

484
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,790
want to get there uh we want to find out

485
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,780
what that success rate is

486
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:10,330
so this distribution I'm a little bit

487
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:14,379
behind right need to be okay so let me

488
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,050
back up just one quick moment so this

489
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,040
distribution is actually the full / this

490
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:24,760
is a scatter plot of the full per pair

491
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:26,560
domain success rate for each individual

492
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,930
domain that we saw in our data set both

493
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,080
in terms of how often that typo happened

494
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:34,690
and how much delay what's the average

495
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,629
delay caused by that that typo and when

496
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,180
we look at the average unregistered typo

497
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,880
delay versus the average adversarial

498
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,220
delay we see that there's a very large

499
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,510
distribution or I'm sorry this is just

500
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,850
the unregistered type of delay there's a

501
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,200
very large distribution where users will

502
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,899
actually get to the site that they

503
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,850
wanted to get to faster if they went to

504
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,680
a adversarial site versus a unregistered

505
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,810
site so there's a lot happening here

506
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,850
it's not really substantially harmful to

507
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,190
a user if we look at the success rate

508
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,980
difference between the two we see that

509
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,200
there's a much larger chance that users

510
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,090
will have a lower success rate getting

511
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,830
to the site that they intended to get to

512
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,439
this actually I'm sorry this is the loss

513
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,300
rate so the opposite thereof so there's

514
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,820
a large number of people that aren't

515
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,690
getting to the site that they intended

516
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,490
to get to but there is a most of them

517
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,740
are getting their relatively roughly in

518
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,350
with the same amount of success so you

519
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,390
are losing visitors but there isn't a

520
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,060
very very substantial amount coming in

521
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,650
there and now we've looked at the loss

522
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,470
we looked at the harm in this situation

523
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,070
from the time loss for the user and the

524
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,440
visitors lost for the website we can

525
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,470
actually turn those values into a loss

526
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,820
of revenue a loss of value a loss of

527
00:21:50,470 --> 00:22:00,070
economic value for the people in this

528
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:03,399
situation so we want to change those in

529
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,040
so if we want to turn loss visitors into

530
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,520
lost revenue we can talk about the lost

531
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,260
cost to acquire a user so if I'm going

532
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
to advertise online i'm going to have

533
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,559
their our site there are studies that

534
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,809
will tell you oh it

535
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,700
acquire a customer for a certain type of

536
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:20,620
business it's going to cost you this

537
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,879
much money to put display ads in front

538
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,610
of somebody and actually get somebody to

539
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:27,158
show up and start using your website if

540
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:30,219
we use those studies and those values to

541
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,940
turn lost visitors into lost value we

542
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,769
see that oh we're losing uh between one

543
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,929
point eight and thirteen million dollars

544
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:40,929
in prospective visitors so this this is

545
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:44,249
what the entire United States population

546
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,749
would have had to do would lose in

547
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:48,610
economic value because they weren't able

548
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:50,590
to attract those visitors to their

549
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,590
website so this is the drag on the

550
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,959
economy as a whole right our

551
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,980
multi-trillion dollar economy the drag

552
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,929
here is on the 22 13 million dollar

553
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:07,330
level so this is not a large number in

554
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:09,850
in the aggregate and if we also look at

555
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,220
the time loss for the users so users who

556
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,509
are a victim of this attack lose time

557
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,190
they waste time that they could have

558
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,080
spent you know visiting that website

559
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,539
that they really wanted to to go visit

560
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,340
and depending on what averages we're

561
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,399
looking at we actually see that if users

562
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,009
get to their intended site faster then

563
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:28,600
they've saved money so the lost here is

564
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:31,119
actually this negative value see that

565
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,158
there's a negative 4.5 million dollar

566
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,110
loss because these people are

567
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,899
perpetrating this attack and it can go

568
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,840
up to 40 million dollars depending on

569
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:43,239
what average what estimate you're using

570
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:48,309
here of lost productivity and we turned

571
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,860
that time value into an economic value

572
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,139
into a money value simply using us

573
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,539
average wage that's you know these are

574
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,490
very very rough ideas but we're still

575
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:00,999
getting an order of magnitude idea is

576
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:03,789
this a billion-dollar problem absolutely

577
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:05,950
not no it's a maybe a million dollar a

578
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,860
ten-million-dollar problem but in the

579
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,200
aggregate of the entire US economy that

580
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,320
we're looking at here that becomes

581
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,470
relatively small potatoes and so another

582
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,990
interesting aspect we can look at here

583
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:25,000
is what is the negative externality

584
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,549
ratio for defenders so if i was going to

585
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,360
instead register these websites myself

586
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,000
and prevent these

587
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,500
these malicious people from taking these

588
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,299
uh taking these visitors from me wasting

589
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,770
these people's time my negative

590
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:42,370
externality ratio here's something like

591
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:44,879
five to one which is lower than not

592
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,040
violent crime so this is not as bad

593
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,980
societally economically as something

594
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,549
like white collar crime and it's nowhere

595
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,020
near as bad as something like you know

596
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,809
violent crime something where there's a

597
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,250
huge negative externality for society

598
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,530
because there are people that are

599
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,900
perpetrating this attack and you can

600
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,210
also contrast this with spam where the

601
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,280
the negative externality ratio for spam

602
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,590
is actually really really high so

603
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,668
because there's so much so many people

604
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,559
are trying to get these unsolicited

605
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:16,660
messages into people's all right

606
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,030
mailboxes there's a hundred to one ratio

607
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,370
there where you know for every one

608
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,600
dollar that I spammer gains because they

609
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,549
were able to get you to buy their

610
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,120
product a hundred dollars were being

611
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:29,679
spent on anti spam or lost productivity

612
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,199
because i had to filter through this

613
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,110
email message all that stuff so that's a

614
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,669
very significant cost so in terms of the

615
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,820
in the grand scheme of which cyber

616
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:41,559
crimes are more damaging the something

617
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,649
like spam comes out way way ahead of

618
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:47,980
something like like typo squatting so

619
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:50,650
yes but maybe because the adversity is

620
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,080
still not using their the thing that is

621
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:56,230
available to them using typo squatting

622
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,299
to the fullest extent while in spam they

623
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,220
already understand they are doing that

624
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,139
for like 20 years and so they understand

625
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,559
where how the money works but here they

626
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:08,710
haven't yet made themselves good enough

627
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:11,530
so i think that's a that's a really

628
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,660
interesting point i think most of all to

629
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,428
me and that there's a there's there's

630
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,860
this value extraction step there's this

631
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,390
i call it like the last mile of cyber

632
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,850
crime net you can do a lot of things

633
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:25,150
online but the the hardest step in a lot

634
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:27,699
of these schemes is turning something

635
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,110
digital into some actual economic value

636
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,360
in your hand that's something that's

637
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,000
very very hard another aspect to this

638
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,168
that i like to call it the the moral

639
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,720
flexibility argument so the attackers

640
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:42,220
could extract more value if they were

641
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
more morally flexible they will

642
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,750
they would make a lot more money if they

643
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,178
put a bunch of ads they put a bunch of

644
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,700
rootkits or drive-by downloads or other

645
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,940
nasty stuff on those typos squatting web

646
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,110
pages but it's going to be less common

647
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,120
for somebody to do that because these

648
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,379
people are they're making some amount of

649
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,689
money they're speculating they are not

650
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,659
you know evil cyber criminals out to

651
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,280
extract every cent from you regardless

652
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,809
of how much it hurt to these are these

653
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,668
are people that are doing online

654
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,260
marketing they aren't really interested

655
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,460
in breaking into your computer but

656
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,000
that's a that's a good point they could

657
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,429
make more money any chance we're

658
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,100
comparing apples to oranges by virtue of

659
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,990
the fact that the data you based your

660
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,580
type of squatting on is in a university

661
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,179
environment where students are fairly

662
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,559
enlightened versus a greater group where

663
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,940
you look at the spamming where you can

664
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,210
have a lot of people across the social

665
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,520
economic around a world situation and as

666
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,840
you mentioned maybe the bad guys haven't

667
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,510
figured out that typo saying could be

668
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,889
pretty lucrative with the right audience

669
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,700
yeah so our ecological validity is

670
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:49,240
limited in that case we are not

671
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,630
necessarily looking at a full cross

672
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,539
section of United States Internet users

673
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:59,860
we are looking at a relatively distorted

674
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:04,299
subset of those users and so I

675
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:07,750
definitely think that that could be the

676
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,400
the case that these users are savier

677
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,049
they can type something in faster so if

678
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,570
we looked at differently abled users we

679
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:16,059
looked at like an older population the

680
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,250
delay might end up much much longer I

681
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,879
don't have some slides in here but i do

682
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:25,240
have slides where we we split out mobile

683
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:29,370
versus man mobile so desktops laptops

684
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,320
and there there's a very recognizable

685
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,729
difference but it was not commenced so

686
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,799
you can use that as a little bit of a

687
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,990
proxy for you know differently able

688
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,820
users i know i'm probably roughly as

689
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,740
fast as maybe a different able person

690
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,990
when i'm on my phone versus if they were

691
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,640
in front of their own like typical

692
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,600
device so i definitely see that as

693
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,720
something that would change our numbers

694
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,070
but i would not worry too much about it

695
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,110
because we're looking at something that

696
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,379
ends up as orders of man

697
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:03,030
to like if the delay went from an extra

698
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,429
10 seconds to an extra 50 seconds I

699
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,299
don't think that would turn this

700
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,850
million-dollar problem into a

701
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,770
billion-dollar problem but that's also

702
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:16,419
really really on point thank you for

703
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,830
bringing that up so the next project I'm

704
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,150
going to talk about here is looking at

705
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:25,230
the ecosystem harm so within the on the

706
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,850
internet one thing that we all love is

707
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,350
free stuff like we get so much free

708
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,270
stuff on the night we get free email we

709
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,549
get free social networking we get free

710
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,160
news we get free information we get all

711
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:39,730
this great stuff and one way this is

712
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,059
supported is this trick called affiliate

713
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,070
marketing a lot of online publishing say

714
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,620
that there's this website i love called

715
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,909
the sweet home com it's a great place to

716
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:54,790
go to see you know what is the one best

717
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,890
juicer to buy and what the way that this

718
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,860
site works they don't serve ads they do

719
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:03,940
all of their reviews totally without you

720
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,469
know take it a bunch of paola this site

721
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,220
makes their money by saying okay when

722
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:12,070
you click on this button right here that

723
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,490
says go buy this amazing food processor

724
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:19,659
at amazon and if you go to amazon and

725
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,809
you go buy that product you will be

726
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,870
giving a kick back to that website

727
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:28,960
because you bought it after clicking

728
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,418
through on that ad that is affiliate

729
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,090
marketing in general when you convert

730
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:35,950
when you go buy something they go back

731
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,820
and pay the website that drove that

732
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:43,720
traffic to the online retailer so that

733
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:48,639
the ecosystem here is web users want

734
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,950
free stuff publishers want to give away

735
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,530
free stuff but also still monetize the

736
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,419
effort and the value and all everything

737
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,580
that goes into creating that free

738
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,230
product and then retailers are saying oh

739
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,480
I want more people to come to my website

740
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,090
I want more people to buy things and so

741
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm going to pay publishers to provide

742
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,100
pre free things in in the hopes that one

743
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,240
of these users are going to come in

744
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:17,260
I my product so affiliate marketing

745
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,200
fraud here is a is an attack that is a

746
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:23,200
minimal technological ingenuity involved

747
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,940
but what it does here so the basic idea

748
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,919
I'll talk about in a minute is that

749
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,450
somebody can swoop in and say out even

750
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,400
though I'm not advertised even though

751
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,500
i'm not giving you all this information

752
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,030
about food processors I still want

753
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,010
whenever you go to amazon to buy

754
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,440
something i want to receive that

755
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:42,250
kickback from amazon because i drove the

756
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,900
traffic to amazon and so if this attack

757
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,970
were really widespread it would endanger

758
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,460
this ecosystem that we have where you

759
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,130
can provide free content without putting

760
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,360
a bunch of noisy ads in front of people

761
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,039
do actually some good effort and give

762
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,809
that to people and the question is you

763
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,710
know this could be a very widespread

764
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,809
attack we can there are other research

765
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,490
results showing that that happens pretty

766
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:06,908
often on the web there are a lot of

767
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,679
people that are trying to perform

768
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,039
affiliate marketing fraud but we don't

769
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,440
actually know are they making money and

770
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,629
this is at how much success the attacker

771
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,450
is getting the other question is uh is

772
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,940
this endangering excuse me our free

773
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,890
content is somebody who is putting the

774
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,289
effort in to be a legitimate affiliate

775
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,940
marketer are they losing out because of

776
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,010
the attacks that are happening and if

777
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,900
they're not losing out then you can

778
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:36,580
worry about oh maybe amazon is paying

779
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,429
more than they need to to attract these

780
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,689
users but i will let amazon deal with

781
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:42,429
amazon's problem we're going to see

782
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,409
whether this is going to endanger the

783
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,820
small publishers that are relying on

784
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:49,980
affiliate marketing to provide these

785
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:52,990
free services so the basic idea for

786
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:57,640
affiliate marketing fraud is I go to

787
00:32:52,990 --> 00:33:00,280
Amazon after so i visited the sweet home

788
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,289
calm I found out oh this food processors

789
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,820
awesome i really want to buy it and i

790
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,940
went over there i click through and now

791
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:11,100
if i buy this or anything at amazon in

792
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,600
the next 24 hours that advertiser that

793
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,629
affiliate will receive some you know

794
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,459
point 1 the three percent commission for

795
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,730
causing that sale if instead of

796
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,930
immediately buying it i just go and i

797
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,760
visit a whole bunch of different webpage

798
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,110
ages what one of those web pages could

799
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,670
do if they're a little bit unscrupulous

800
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,149
is lega saying well I'm going to have

801
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,830
some invisible little pixel load up the

802
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,350
amazon web page you know in the

803
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,870
background in some small i frame and put

804
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,330
my own token in their single I'm the

805
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,550
person who drove traffic to Amazon it if

806
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,730
this person buys anything from amazon in

807
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,710
the next 24 hours then i get the value

808
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,800
even though I wasn't putting it forward

809
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,060
to you know drive that traffic i was

810
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,950
just saying oh i know that there's a

811
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,810
visitor to my website I'm going to trick

812
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,660
their computer into dropping this cookie

813
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,639
on their machine to get that value

814
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,190
instead of allowing that legitimate

815
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,230
marketer to do so so they drop their

816
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,780
cookie I eventually go back and buy it

817
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,490
and even though the legitimate affiliate

818
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,920
marketer is the one that inspired me to

819
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:14,620
buy it this fraudsters the one that

820
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,780
would be deriving that value some you

821
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,210
know small percentage of that order

822
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,990
total so again we're going to use the

823
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,750
same data set a nice anonymized web

824
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,339
visit data set that we have they're

825
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,699
looking at 164 different affiliate

826
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,990
marketing programs my fantastic PhD

827
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,969
student peter schneider went through and

828
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,859
manually collected you know what it is

829
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,199
that each of these affiliate marketing

830
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:43,150
systems are using for keeping track of

831
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:45,189
the fact that a user click through we

832
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,900
built a fraud classifier so we're trying

833
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,030
to extrapolate how many people are

834
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,410
actually clicking through and having

835
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,900
these cookies drop the both the

836
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,909
legitimate ones and the fraudulent ones

837
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,570
and then try and say okay what we want

838
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:00,910
to find is the specific situation where

839
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,290
somebody visited a legitimate marketer

840
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,330
and will determine whether it's a

841
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,360
legitimate market or not whether the

842
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,850
user continued to perform activities on

843
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,710
that website whether it's amazon or

844
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,319
GoDaddy or whoever's doing the affiliate

845
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,910
marketing say okay these are the users

846
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,290
that were legitimately driven to that

847
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,370
website they saw it they were

848
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,110
interacting with it we're going to

849
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,270
presume that means that they wanted to

850
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,730
be there versus the illegitimate ones

851
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,310
where we see the page opens but there's

852
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,400
a small or zero check percent chance

853
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,720
that the user actually continues to

854
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,660
interact with that page that's our a

855
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,220
sump that's our indicator that that

856
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,330
person was actually driven there

857
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,790
project Lee if they go there and then

858
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,848
immediately leave we're saying that was

859
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,800
probably probably fraudulent so we want

860
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:48,520
to say okay how often does somebody

861
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,130
visit the legitimate advertiser not

862
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,990
purchase something and then go ahead and

863
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:57,369
visit the illegitimate fraudster and

864
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,618
then go and purchase something because

865
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,740
that's actually where value is being

866
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:04,420
pulled out of that affiliate marketers

867
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,979
pocket if it weren't for that then this

868
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,680
isn't actually causing harm in the

869
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,750
ecosystem it isn't actually endangering

870
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,210
affiliate marketing from the publishers

871
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,349
point of view so we found in our data

872
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:19,900
set was about fifteen thousand different

873
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:21,609
referrals at Amazon definitely the big

874
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,359
big big one in here that everybody

875
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:26,980
else's relative noise compared to Amazon

876
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,609
we found you know if we actually just

877
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,140
just look at those referrals there's a

878
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:34,900
very substantial set right you know to

879
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,609
three thousand out of thirteen thousand

880
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,070
is a pretty big number in terms of

881
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:41,020
honest vs vs fraudulent but if we

882
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,690
actually look at the conversion events

883
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,009
there were these fifteen thousand

884
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,500
different conversion events and again

885
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,300
this is where we we're going to say when

886
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,190
we see somebody click on the checkout

887
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,369
button that's going to push them through

888
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,619
to a ssl site we can't see anything

889
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:58,089
about whether they actually chose to buy

890
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,550
that but we're going to use that as a

891
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:01,990
rough proxy for somebody was going was

892
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,400
probably going to go and buy this

893
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,990
there's a reasonable chance that they

894
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,880
did that so we just make the simplifying

895
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,368
assumption that that is a conversion

896
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,990
event that we want to track and we found

897
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:16,540
out of the 15,000 conversion events 174

898
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:18,839
of them were fraudulent so this was

899
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:22,089
somebody who was able to successfully

900
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:25,509
sadie front amazon but none out of those

901
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:28,119
15,600 were actually stolen we never saw

902
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:31,359
somebody go to a legitimate affiliate

903
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,119
marketer and then have that cookie

904
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,790
stolen by some fraudulent marketer and

905
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,180
then create value for themselves so this

906
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:44,290
is defrauding the provider but it's not

907
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,430
defrauding the the publisher so even

908
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,380
though there's a large number of these

909
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,720
fraudulent transactions we're still not

910
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,750
seeing a substantial amount that are

911
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,149
causing damage for that ecosystem of how

912
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,300
can you trust that affiliate marketing

913
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,890
will give you a fair shake and this is

914
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,060
also it's easier to look at it it's

915
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,400
better for us to look at that because

916
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,020
Amazon all these providers that are

917
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,550
providing these affiliate marketing

918
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,000
programs they have a lot more visibility

919
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,430
than we do as passive Network monitors

920
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,350
they have a lot more they could do to

921
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:19,200
detect those fraudulent transactions so

922
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:21,420
those 174 we see there we have no idea

923
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,220
whether any of those were paid out by

924
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,680
amazon they can actually take a look and

925
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,540
say oh none of these people are looking

926
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,279
at the same object or not buying the

927
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,920
thing that they click through on there's

928
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,510
a lot of ways that amazon at all can

929
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,020
minimize the impact of those fraudulent

930
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,090
transactions so the last project I'm

931
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,230
going to talk about here is looking into

932
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:49,380
you know if we know how much harm comes

933
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,510
to users what good is that right we

934
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,640
don't necessarily we can't immediately

935
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,440
do something simply knowing oh this

936
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,790
isn't that big a problem maybe when we

937
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,040
do find something it is a bigger problem

938
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,600
how can we use that insight to give us

939
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,610
an idea of what the heck is going on and

940
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:12,509
make our cyber security a little bit

941
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:13,980
better so in this a project we looked at

942
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,620
something we call credential based

943
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,970
privilege escalation so one common

944
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,609
situation is oh if I create an

945
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,819
accountant almost anything that's not

946
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:29,280
say an online bank or email service or

947
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,070
Facebook the only thing that I need in

948
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,300
order to reset the password to that

949
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:37,440
service is a access to the email account

950
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,540
like if you had access to my personal

951
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,660
email account you'd be able to get into

952
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,550
my amazonica you'd be able to get into

953
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,710
you know all sorts of different accounts

954
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,960
that I have because your email is just a

955
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,300
default password reset so having access

956
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,430
to the email is roughly equivalent to

957
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,580
having access to every single account

958
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,440
that the user runs through that account

959
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,690
and cyber criminals can sell these

960
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,880
accounts can sell access to them you can

961
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,819
still access to say that Amazon account

962
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,069
then that user that cyber criminal can

963
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:12,619
say oh I'm going to use this stored

964
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:15,180
credit card number excuse me to say bye

965
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:17,099
amazon gift cards i'm going to go and

966
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,710
sell those on craigslist or some other

967
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,079
random place and i'll get i'll launder

968
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:26,130
that in that way you see this is

969
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,470
relatively common with Apple so you have

970
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,130
like iTunes gift cards you've got

971
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:34,348
spotify premium there's walmart has

972
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,059
while in our gift cards amazon has these

973
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,980
e gift cards these are relatively

974
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,200
popular in the in the cyber criminal

975
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,170
underground because you can turn access

976
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,450
to that account into laundered money in

977
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:49,529
your own personal account because you

978
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:50,848
sold some credit some some value said oh

979
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:52,890
I'm gonna go on Craigslist i'm going to

980
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,369
say i'm selling a gift cards that are

981
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,720
worth fifty dollars but i'll take 25 and

982
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:00,119
so you know i want to go buy something

983
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,750
they've effectively laundered that 25

984
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,059
like clean dollars out and the person

985
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,460
who bought that may or may not buy

986
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:12,839
something and time before that credit

987
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,400
gets shut down so in this situation we

988
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,990
know that this is a bad thing we know

989
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,089
that if somebody get to know your

990
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:21,328
account they're going to be able to

991
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:23,160
monetize it in every which way that with

992
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:25,470
that we've found by looking at

993
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,538
cybercrime over the past several years

994
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,368
and our goal in this situation is to say

995
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,559
like let's use this idea of how much

996
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:33,269
harm comes to the user to communicate to

997
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,480
them that this is a bad thing and help

998
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:38,368
them practice better cybersecurity

999
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,970
hygiene so what we've built in this

1000
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:45,480
situation is a tool which will allow you

1001
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:49,759
to receive it a personalized audit of

1002
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,109
how valuable your email account is to a

1003
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:54,750
cybercriminal attacker and so the

1004
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:57,119
vulnerability of intrinsic in this idea

1005
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,089
of having a primary email account can be

1006
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,470
shown to the user not just as some

1007
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:03,538
statistic that shows up in an

1008
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,609
infographic but as a personalized piece

1009
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,049
of data saying not just any account not

1010
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:09,180
just the average account but your

1011
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:13,500
account your account is worth this much

1012
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:16,529
to a to a cybercriminal so we went

1013
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,829
through a decent a process here trying

1014
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:19,489
to

1015
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:21,450
gather a bunch of data this one is a

1016
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:22,319
isn't using the same data set we had

1017
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,868
before so this is something that's

1018
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,279
active we have a website cloud sweeper

1019
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:31,200
dot CS usc.edu where we have a few

1020
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:33,779
different research projects that we ask

1021
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,459
people to participate in if they if they

1022
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:37,469
want to see what's going on here and so

1023
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:40,049
with this project with this specific

1024
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:42,089
accounts left audit tool will do is it

1025
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:43,950
will say okay well we're going to find

1026
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:46,140
which account which free accounts you

1027
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,049
have access to we know what their

1028
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,140
password reset situations are we say oh

1029
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:54,359
well if you if you your account was

1030
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,129
stolen then an attacker would be able to

1031
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:58,950
access this this this this and this and

1032
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:01,499
we also know from communicating with one

1033
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,269
of some of our friends that spend time

1034
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:05,339
cruising the cyber criminal underground

1035
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:09,689
how much are those accounts going for we

1036
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:12,299
got a adds 40 or will sell spotify

1037
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,609
accounts for three dollars and amazon

1038
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,869
accounts for ten dollars and Apple

1039
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,459
accounts for twenty dollars something

1040
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:19,410
like that we say oh well if you have

1041
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:21,808
that account then what would it what

1042
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,920
would the value of somebody parting out

1043
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:24,630
your account just taking it and saying

1044
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,549
oh I'm going to sell you know chris's

1045
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,170
apple account and krista's amazon

1046
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:32,609
account so all of those how much could i

1047
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:34,859
make in that situation just show that to

1048
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:36,690
the user so the users seeing two primary

1049
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,369
pieces of information here one they're

1050
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,170
seeing exactly how many different

1051
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:42,499
accounts that they are running through

1052
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,940
that one primary email account like how

1053
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:46,589
how much of their life revolves around

1054
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,119
the fact that they have access to it and

1055
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:51,630
the other thing we're showing them is

1056
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,719
how much value the cybercriminal could

1057
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:57,539
make by stealing it and then going and

1058
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,180
selling all that information and so we

1059
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:04,199
we tracked 1400 different account types

1060
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,029
we used a great service more of a public

1061
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,249
service call there's a plaintext

1062
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:10,650
offenders is this great website that

1063
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:12,660
will simply publish like a name and

1064
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,940
shame of saying here's all of the

1065
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,368
services that will send you your

1066
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,199
password in the clear after like through

1067
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,549
email and so we were able to bootstrap

1068
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,529
off of that and collect quite a bit

1069
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:24,809
quite a bit of data there we don't have

1070
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:27,119
too much of the underground information

1071
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:30,299
and a lot of it we have now is a few

1072
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,979
years old so that's more of a rough

1073
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:34,769
submit than a you know very

1074
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:38,069
scientifically rigorous estimate of the

1075
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:40,618
value in those accounts and when we

1076
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:43,650
looked at about just short of 10,000

1077
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,269
different people using that service we

1078
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,099
found that you know the average email

1079
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,928
account that somebody was using at the

1080
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,089
service at about of value about fourteen

1081
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:55,079
dollars and the maximum we really saw

1082
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:58,469
was forty dollars would be the value to

1083
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,929
an attacker if they were to take over

1084
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:03,029
this account and something we saw is

1085
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:05,459
really interesting there's a few people

1086
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:07,109
commenting on this I'm you know online

1087
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:08,428
news sites one of the one of the most

1088
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:11,400
interesting ones I saw was somebody

1089
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:13,529
saying WOW my account is worth two

1090
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,819
dollars and thirty cents to a

1091
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:20,069
cybercriminal that is almost nothing

1092
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:22,369
especially compared to how much I would

1093
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:25,499
lose if I lost access to this account

1094
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:27,179
it's a it's this negative externality

1095
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:28,499
ratio that I was talking about earlier

1096
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:30,660
on this person you know they just

1097
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:32,759
intuitively saw this is a really bad

1098
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,189
situation where somebody can they just

1099
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:37,589
make like chump change compared to how

1100
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:40,140
much harm comes to comes to me and so

1101
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:41,640
one thing that we did as part of this

1102
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,529
not really the part of the study but

1103
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,808
more the public service aspect of it as

1104
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:47,400
soon as we popped up the you know this

1105
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,499
is how much your account is worth here's

1106
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,179
how many account how many other counts

1107
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,859
you run through this email we say you

1108
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,529
know what can you do you can use a

1109
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,150
strong password you can use two-factor

1110
00:45:55,529 --> 00:46:00,119
authentication try and use that

1111
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:02,069
teachable moment idea to and help people

1112
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,779
do better cyber security we've got

1113
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:06,209
another project we're starting right now

1114
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:10,890
we're actually going to try and judge

1115
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:12,479
how effective that that messaging is but

1116
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:16,109
that's something that is just getting

1117
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,968
spun up right now so to conclude what I

1118
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:20,609
really like to look at what I think

1119
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:23,759
should be looked at is the costs of

1120
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:26,880
cybercrime in terms of time lost money

1121
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:28,410
lost data lost and if we can look at

1122
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,539
these and actually provide some

1123
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,038
reasonable we don't have to have you

1124
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,779
know down to the dollars and cents but

1125
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,059
if we can just get orders of magnitude

1126
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:38,099
so that we can do a very rough apples to

1127
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,799
apples comparison between completely

1128
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,650
different technical attacks we can say

1129
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:45,480
well we can improve our allocation of

1130
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,700
our scarce effort to say we're only

1131
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,320
going we're going to primarily focus on

1132
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,740
defending against the things that are

1133
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:55,140
most harmful to people and if we know if

1134
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,910
we can make that measurement then we can

1135
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,940
say oh we've actually improved outcomes

1136
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:01,680
we have provided some positive impact so

1137
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,480
that people are better off we can

1138
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,250
empirically say people are better off

1139
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,070
there are fewer attacks that are causing

1140
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,650
real world harm and we can show that

1141
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,420
which is super helpful both within the

1142
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,120
associate technical aspect but also some

1143
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,530
of use working on a purely technical

1144
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,710
defense they can use something that

1145
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,990
looks at it this way to say oh by

1146
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,570
deploying this service I can say people

1147
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:27,120
this many days this many dollars this

1148
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,410
much data and we can also improve

1149
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,900
communication because if we can actually

1150
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:33,680
say this is how harmful this is to you

1151
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:37,470
not in terms of thousands of machines

1152
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,450
compromised or a 10 gigabit DDoS attack

1153
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,819
but in terms of you could lose this much

1154
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,069
money you could lose this much time then

1155
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:47,820
you're going to be able to create a more

1156
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:50,070
effective cyber security regime so thank

1157
00:47:47,820 --> 00:48:02,130
you for that and I will be very happy to

1158
00:47:50,070 --> 00:48:05,160
take any questions I had one question

1159
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,830
did you for the second aspect did you

1160
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,160
convey the resistor amazone to see what

1161
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,930
they have to say not unless amazon is

1162
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,910
reading the workshop on the economy of

1163
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:19,859
the information security ok yeah

1164
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:22,020
presumably some somebody there is but

1165
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,480
whether they would take that back to you

1166
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,480
have a question and the the first

1167
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,060
section you really didn't look at the

1168
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,980
the costs associated with malware was

1169
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,230
that because you were able to that this

1170
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,890
type of squatting that just wasn't a

1171
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:41,340
common use of it yeah so that we had a

1172
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:44,640
music Sakura T paper in 2014 where we

1173
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:47,280
were we looked at a lot of the type of

1174
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,290
squatting in the in the long tail and so

1175
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,290
we looked at both on popular sites than

1176
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:55,630
on less popular sites and the occurrence

1177
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:58,590
of malware based on

1178
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:00,730
something like google safebrowsing was

1179
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,680
practically non-existent so that's

1180
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:06,100
that's why we didn't include that as a

1181
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:11,589
factor in our in that aggregate value at

1182
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:13,180
the end once things become that rare it

1183
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,210
becomes very hard to factor them into

1184
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:19,839
the aggregate that's a so one thing that

1185
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,920
we haven't looked at yet but we are or

1186
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:27,850
what we're trying to look at right now

1187
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:31,050
is cross brand typos squatting so

1188
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:36,009
something where there is damage to a

1189
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:38,110
specific actor because somebody else was

1190
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:41,500
typo squatting on on their name so

1191
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,330
there's one thing if some so there's

1192
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,310
somebody who put a bunch of ads in front

1193
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,170
of a user they're just trying to make a

1194
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,210
buck by putting these ads in front of a

1195
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,460
user but if somebody is actually saying

1196
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,950
oh well I'm Burger King and i'm going to

1197
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,150
type 0 squat on you know west lafayette

1198
00:49:53,950 --> 00:50:00,460
mcdonalds com there's a significant

1199
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:02,650
potential cost there if they are able to

1200
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,730
do that successfully and so that's

1201
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,340
something that we're looking at right

1202
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,770
now where the that's another factor in

1203
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:12,670
that value that damage that that comes

1204
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:14,080
in where instead of an attacker that's

1205
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,220
just doing this generic attack weird

1206
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,730
something it's actually targeted saying

1207
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:21,430
i'm going to use your brand to bring

1208
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:23,500
value to my specific brain where there's

1209
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:28,259
a much clearer idea of malice than a

1210
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,260
generic you know domain Parker

1211
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:38,700
okay well I'd like that thank you
