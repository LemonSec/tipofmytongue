1
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:13,059
well good afternoon welcome

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,599
today I'm pleased to announce one of our

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:20,480
distinguished serious alumni and this is

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,529
abhilasha spans ille bhargav bansal I

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,869
said that wrong good night in my

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,270
apologies so anyway she's here to talk

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,279
to us from Intel and she's going to talk

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,880
about digital identity protection and I

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:35,390
will turn it over to her Thank You Jerry

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,370
it's a lovely to be here I'm sure Jerry

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,270
was practicing my name a little bit at

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:47,149
least last time I talked I had half the

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:50,480
name and it was about you know 10 12

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,070
years back and it's you know when you

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,919
come back ten years after staying at

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,890
Purdue how how great it is to be back

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,069
today I'll be talking about a certain

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:05,420
area which was part of my research and I

19
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:07,640
am very happy to have been pursuing it

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,350
in my work life how many of you are grad

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:16,030
students one hundred percent okay cool

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,350
so and how many up pursuing PhD

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,600
excellent and others are deciding to do

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,030
it eventually okay so so so this was the

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,140
topic of my thesis when I was here at

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,759
Purdue and and I would also show some

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,590
examples of how to translate some of

28
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:39,200
these activities back to the real world

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,200
so getting right to it as i mentioned i

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,329
am a parabola maker i spent from two

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,990
thousand to two thousand seven at purdue

32
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:50,059
i had a lot of fun purdue offers so many

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,219
different majors and i tried every one

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,030
of them like a buffet but it was a lot

35
00:01:52,219 --> 00:02:00,288
of fun aqui guiding factor was doing

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,659
research professor Wagstaff professor

37
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,700
spafford and I think five six other

38
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,740
professors who were over the semesters

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,429
provided a lot of good research

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,890
experience and I just gradually went to

41
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:17,210
grad studies I didn't even realize when

42
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:21,559
I finished my undergrad there was this

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,390
is a very this is a almost like a home

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,690
to me i just remembered last time when I

45
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,730
was

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,290
here my sister was popping her head we

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,899
know showing her thumbs like I'm still

48
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,179
doing well I've done a lot of talks but

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,150
that was one of the first few and it's

50
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,550
really great to gain that kind of

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,980
experience at Purdue and i graduated in

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,750
2007 and joined Intel so I've been there

53
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:47,090
ever since I'm good with questions

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,420
during the talk so please feel free to

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,370
ask me questions from here on it's a you

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,160
know talking about digital identity I

57
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,040
think it's a topic close to the heart

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,070
because it applies to everyone as a

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,320
consumer if you are doing it as a big

60
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,920
project so understanding the basics of

61
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,100
identity what is authentication you all

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,149
attend the security seminar so you are

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,609
understand the importance of

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,020
authentication we're revisiting the

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,820
security and privacy requirements the

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,130
slides don't go into a lot of details

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,570
but I'm happy to get into them if you

68
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,489
need to so the idea is to give you an

69
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,060
example of a real world solution and

70
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,070
what it took to get it to you know

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,860
millions of devices it takes a lot of

72
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,190
effort to take an idea from concept to

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,660
actual implementation and out there I

74
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:46,900
would also like to spend some time on

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,120
some of the newer initiatives and Orien

76
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,830
will present some of the new things that

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,530
we are doing with Intel's makers program

78
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,660
and also the efforts in cyber security

79
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,450
and also increasing the diversity in

80
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:04,910
cyber security and computer science in

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:09,200
general so the first thing who knows

82
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:13,489
where this icon is from ranking so I'm

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,229
not a dinosaur 88 yeah so what is

84
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:20,750
identity I think they are microphones

85
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,700
all over so I can repeat your answer but

86
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,700
what do you think is identity

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:50,630
exactly so I think basically the

88
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,909
gentleman said that it is how I

89
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,669
determine who you are and that's exactly

90
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,770
it it is a claim made by one subject

91
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,539
over you know saying this is how I

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,669
determine and what are these claims and

93
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,139
it's a claim you tell me that you're a

94
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,820
student of Purdue how do I know that

95
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,340
you're a student or purdue you will

96
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,139
probably show me some proof saying

97
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,090
here's my badge like how do I know that

98
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,500
badge is correct so you may go up the

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,859
chain to understand if this particular

100
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,280
identity is really what it is the badge

101
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,340
is just one of the things the idea of

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,919
how we identify a given user can be

103
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,719
determined by multiple aspects just like

104
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,049
a human being right we don't just check

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,030
your badge and say hello you know nice

106
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,220
to meet you it's by checking a bunch of

107
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,950
things associated with the user so it

108
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,849
could be what you know what you have who

109
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,830
you are interestingly our digital

110
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,590
identities becoming very close to our

111
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,260
physical one right what you wear what

112
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,840
you like your behavior it's getting very

113
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,700
very tight you know the first talk many

114
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,219
many years back there was almost a clear

115
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,010
distinction between your identity in the

116
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,590
cyber world versus your identity in the

117
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,659
real world with the increased

118
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,789
personalized services with the increase

119
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,210
of machine learning AI back end the

120
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:11,090
learning of who this user is is becoming

121
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,719
increasingly comprehensive right it is

122
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,289
using multiple factors gestures

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,039
attributes associated with the user and

124
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:24,860
then identifying the user based on that

125
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,710
the confidence that I have about a

126
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,650
user's identity greatly depends on the

127
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,580
quality of these various aspects as well

128
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,710
as the number of them right I can

129
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,090
potentially compromise the student ID I

130
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,810
won't ask anybody to resign

131
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,448
counterfeited student ID to get into the

132
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,380
chocolate shop or something but

133
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,740
everybody's a grad student here so

134
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,960
that's probably not an issue however

135
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,570
compromising other factors you know

136
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,460
compromising your biometrics along with

137
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,770
compromising your ID card may be

138
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,888
slightly harder so the probability of

139
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,469
spoofing users identity when you add the

140
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:10,320
number of factors and strong factors

141
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:14,160
becomes becomes less so there's an

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:19,950
increase you need for a strong identity

143
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:24,900
and as you will see who can who can see

144
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,240
where the role of identity is in this is

145
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,799
it in one when you obtain the

146
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,380
credentials to when you plant the

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,720
malware or when you grab the data or

148
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,300
when you accelerate or remove the data

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,070
from the victim's laptop or other other

150
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:45,090
devices this is a regular anatomy of a

151
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,490
breach as in all of them it's all of

152
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,500
them right so you use social engineering

153
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,080
attacks that's exactly correct right you

154
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,070
use different types of identity based

155
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,409
attacks the hundred thousand per day if

156
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,719
you look at a lot of the surveys the

157
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,650
number of user information that is being

158
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,570
captured to number one to plant malware

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,179
to get additional user information and

160
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:13,650
then take that information and create

161
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,919
data banks and exploit it is is is high

162
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,169
and also the costs are associated with

163
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,930
this are increasing you know the number

164
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,419
of breaches every single year you will

165
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,780
just see a super big number and the

166
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:33,478
damage it caused to the user to

167
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:35,819
businesses to any any kind of vertical

168
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,640
that you may be thinking of so what is

169
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,289
essential is is our attention to

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:48,839
preserving and protecting this identity

171
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:51,900
so i will put together some examples

172
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,360
here has does anyone is anyone aware of

173
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,920
any

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,839
these examples has anybody seen the

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,680
anthem where the compromise admin

176
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:06,279
password got it or IRS I see a lot of

177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,099
nodding heads right so the the this is

178
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,439
not new almost every month if not every

179
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,930
week we hear something about some login

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,600
credentials being stolen and the problem

181
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,790
is one that we are using those passwords

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,470
we should stop using those passwords and

183
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,110
the other is the ability to you know

184
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:30,550
fight against social engineering and

185
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,170
other things which compromise the the

186
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,550
password itself or the token that is

187
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:41,019
associated with the user so identity

188
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,149
theft this is my my daughter who was

189
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,680
about one in one and a half years old

190
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,480
when she started thinking about identity

191
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:55,000
theft yeah it's not true but it was

192
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,760
funny how how the kids um when they are

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,390
born I when as you go on you will see

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,209
how much their information is recorded

195
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,279
starting from the very basics you know

196
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:09,369
even the DNA sample to a large extent

197
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,839
and all of this is stored and I don't

198
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,300
think people really know how to track it

199
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,519
there are a lot of good identity theft

200
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,010
protection services out there but there

201
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,310
is no means a mechanism to really track

202
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,420
every possible way of attacking of

203
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,399
figuring out whether your identity has

204
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,969
been compromised and it's not just

205
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,839
financial it's a the the impact of

206
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,339
identity theft is in fraud you know

207
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,860
whether somebody is trying to use your

208
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:39,220
information to get cause health care or

209
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,940
criminal records etc so identity theft

210
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,529
goes way into destroying a person's life

211
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,600
and it is if you go to DEFCON

212
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,990
conferences and others you will see how

213
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,170
it how easy it is to get enough to

214
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,260
compromise the user's identity social

215
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:00,339
engineering attacks you know leading to

216
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,860
compromise of user information again in

217
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,260
all of the top conferences they show how

218
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,630
it you can call some

219
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,420
random service which has a lot of

220
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,410
information and how easy it is to get

221
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,959
your information from then if you want

222
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,270
to meet me offline I can show you a few

223
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,280
links of how how interesting it was to

224
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:25,360
find out your fellow students home

225
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,730
address way they've lived how this

226
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,080
information is here so easily accessible

227
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,130
and just because of social engineering

228
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,810
attacks phishing attacks and the points

229
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,700
of attacks in an identity system is not

230
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,010
1 and 0 it's not just that one door that

231
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,020
you need to put a lock on the entire

232
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,230
identity system has multiple points of

233
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,970
attack you have the sensor itself where

234
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,420
you could put a fake biometric you could

235
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,070
or credential you could replay all data

236
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,479
so this is where things start becoming

237
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,150
interesting from the technical

238
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,010
standpoint you look at an identity

239
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,930
subsystem and you break it into small

240
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,390
pieces you know you capture the

241
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,319
biometric you transfer it from the

242
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,670
sensor to the feature extractor you can

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,620
potentially compromise the extractor

244
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,599
itself right you put another piece of

245
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,330
software to override the feature

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,820
extractor you can synthesize a brand new

247
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:19,600
feature vector which can go into the

248
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,450
matter or overwrite the matter itself so

249
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,220
you may have everything perfect but you

250
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,810
can all all you have to do is switch

251
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,210
you've seen some of those movies you

252
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:31,030
switch the biometric in the back end and

253
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,360
you're mapping your matching against the

254
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:38,020
compromised users biometric so it's kind

255
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,180
of interesting that you just are looking

256
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,430
for that weakest link and many of the

257
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,069
times you do everything to protect it

258
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,949
from one to seven and you know all your

259
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,900
attacks are protected but the attack is

260
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,060
simply overrides the final decision if

261
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,420
it's not articulated properly so some

262
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,130
kind of a replay attack so this may be

263
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,750
simple to you because you read Purdue

264
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,970
and you're you know studying security

265
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,370
but this is a very hard concept to get

266
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,410
through to understand that it's not just

267
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,660
one solution that is going to fix it all

268
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,870
it's looking at the end-to-end system

269
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,250
also looking at the entire lifecycle the

270
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:18,340
idea of looking at the registration how

271
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,000
did you get your purdue ID in the first

272
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,240
place right

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,830
how did you go to the pmu and do some

274
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,620
proofing show your driver's license

275
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,620
passport whatnot how did that proofing

276
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,450
happen in a digital world you don't have

277
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,400
the luxury of doing in person proofing

278
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,530
so you need flexible registration

279
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,390
options this is where everything fails

280
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,020
by the way today there is no way to go

281
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,819
back in history and fix it so being able

282
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,680
to prove and register identities

283
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,720
correctly in the first place is a big

284
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,680
challenge making sure the user has

285
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,410
choice this world looking at the privacy

286
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,540
and security concerns then once you've

287
00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:01,150
registered the I user identity looking

288
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:05,290
at the usage so can anybody has anybody

289
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:07,900
seen how an identity that was originally

290
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,709
issued could be misused that means it's

291
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,569
a function creep like I issued my social

292
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,150
security you know for getting social

293
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,460
security services but you pretty much

294
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:21,250
use your social security number for a

295
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,320
bunch of other things right that's where

296
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,720
the flaw is and it makes identity theft

297
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,740
a lot easy does anybody else have

298
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,130
another example of usage or function

299
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,810
creep of how identity is used in

300
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,810
different ways and originally intended

301
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,770
I don't know if you guys are looking at

302
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,890
how the various information that you

303
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,560
have for stores and other things where

304
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,240
you get some you know discount for items

305
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,890
when you when you provide that

306
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,400
information that can potentially be used

307
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:03,699
for other types of analysis so they are

308
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,030
certain privacy requirements and minimal

309
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,010
disclosure depending on how that

310
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,050
information is used there is also

311
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,500
maintenance issues you know if somebody

312
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,420
was to poison the database of identity

313
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,300
information the more you look at it is

314
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,729
very very very interesting it's not just

315
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,800
about looking at your username and

316
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,470
password it will also know when you're

317
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,150
smiling or frowning or you know there

318
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,620
will be a lot of your information that

319
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,949
would be maintained in the back end

320
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,420
being able to have been notified be able

321
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,840
to make sure the quality of data is

322
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,870
correct so if there's notification

323
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,230
alerts and finally the revocation which

324
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,520
is very very hard some of the professors

325
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,160
at Purdue are working on the revocation

326
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,050
being able to flexibly rebook an

327
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,550
information that is incorrect about to

328
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,500
you or just remove it because you don't

329
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,079
want it out there it's very hard problem

330
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,720
in today's world so there are numerous

331
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,530
opportunities for research us graduate

332
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,600
students on each of these areas that has

333
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,800
to be done and one thing that will

334
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,830
continue to be a war is between the need

335
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,420
for privacy versus security so who over

336
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,500
here believes that the privacy versus

337
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,209
security is a contradictory requirement

338
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,040
they either choose one either have

339
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:29,230
security and accountability or you have

340
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:35,110
privacy you say mom that you think it's

341
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:39,750
a choice and that is what most of the

342
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:42,320
people's think and do you have a comment

343
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,839
you Jamaican

344
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,320
yeah i think if if you are super

345
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,120
paranoid about your privacy then then

346
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,279
you have to let go of security with them

347
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,940
I'm specifically thinking of smart homes

348
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,490
mm-hmm because I know when someone's in

349
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,980
the bedroom I know when my gas is

350
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,609
leaking or something of that sort but

351
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,079
then i'm giving up privacy and a good

352
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,510
considerable amount of privacy like the

353
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,490
data is being collected and the entire

354
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,349
point is for them to collect the data so

355
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,990
that i know what's happening even when

356
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:20,879
i'm not at home so i really think it's

357
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:26,849
you choose your yeah yeah yeah it's a

358
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,730
choice with choose one so so my thesis

359
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:31,340
was actually to achieve privacy very

360
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,440
highly secure privacy-preserving

361
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,720
solution so not jeopardize privacy but

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,050
achieve the level of security and if we

363
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,530
look at the intersection between the two

364
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,120
is blue and blue and blue so if you

365
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,899
cannot see the Venn diagram that's fine

366
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,850
but bottom line here is what you said is

367
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,920
one hundred percent accurate right it

368
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,490
feels as if we are giving away something

369
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,970
and we do have to but they are certain

370
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,429
mitigations like for example if you know

371
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,830
what is the policy of how that data is

372
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,300
being collected and being used and it is

373
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,040
not being used for anything else like

374
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,510
nobody is just using it to figure out

375
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,520
patterns so that they can sell you

376
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,440
something more or you have a selective

377
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,020
disclosure it's like I want this to be

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,200
revealed but not that right being able

379
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,420
to be notified so they are certain

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,730
attributes of privacy that can be

381
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,910
achieved while achieving the much needed

382
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:30,570
security and safety you know making sure

383
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:33,420
we can have all the confidentiality

384
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,730
integrity availability audit revoke

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,670
ability and so on so each one of them

386
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,679
has a lot of a lot of work if you go

387
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,620
into the crypto world achieving a

388
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,440
non-repudiation take took years you know

389
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,959
to get to the point where you can be

390
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,290
hundred percent show that this user

391
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,820
indeed did the transaction so so there

392
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,899
is the there is a balance between secure

393
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:02,559
privacy and my challenge to you is to

394
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:04,330
look at your solution such that you

395
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,570
don't have to give up on one to achieve

396
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:11,860
the other and I think that's that's an

397
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,710
interesting area of research so one

398
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,500
example of how we achieve this balance

399
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,210
was based on a project that I've been

400
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,240
working out at Intel it's based on

401
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,149
trusted execution technology or trusted

402
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,590
execution environment our folks aware of

403
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:32,080
what tes are now so essentially you

404
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:36,490
think of it as an isolated secure area

405
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,129
where you can store execute and process

406
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,750
information so it can be done in

407
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:43,178
different ways it can be hardware based

408
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,340
there is something called the software

409
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:47,590
guard extensions from Intel there is in

410
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,389
the non Intel voltage and the arm side

411
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:54,658
is at rest soon and you would also have

412
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:57,219
they are they are separate parts of the

413
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:59,379
chipset which allow you to have a

414
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,000
separate converts security engine which

415
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:03,850
allows you to have this trusted

416
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,639
application to run and when it links to

417
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,559
an end to end solution it provides the

418
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:14,019
level of security you need to have a

419
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:16,779
secure solution so I will give you an

420
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,399
example of how RTE can be used so when

421
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,529
you are collecting the data you

422
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,508
collected within a te then you have a

423
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:26,289
crypto channel that transmits it

424
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:28,330
securely to your signal processing

425
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:32,230
feature so that could be some kind of an

426
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:34,269
enclave within your system that is

427
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,669
responsible for doing it so you're going

428
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:40,659
from one trusted execution environment

429
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:42,519
to the other and evaluating if you are a

430
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:45,490
biometric which is also protected by

431
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,279
that te is correct so once you do that

432
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,019
matching with a database that is

433
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,519
encrypted and only can be decrypted

434
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:53,620
within that a trusted execution

435
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,200
environment then you come up with a

436
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,689
final answer which is a cryptographic

437
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,360
token based on keys that are also

438
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,029
protected within that EE so it can be

439
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,428
used to hard in every aspect of existing

440
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:08,650
biometric authentication systems so that

441
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,150
is one example of how we

442
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,050
chip a high level of security but we

443
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:18,430
didn't leave our secure zone to achieve

444
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,800
that so an example or is the work that

445
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,180
I've been doing at Intel the product is

446
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,030
called Intel authenticate it was

447
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,100
announced earlier this year it actually

448
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,950
is a hardware based mechanism to do

449
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,169
multi-factor authentication and it's

450
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:36,540
available anywhere after the 6th gen

451
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:39,310
intel core vpro platforms and

452
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,320
essentially think of it as an identity

453
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:45,129
engine in the hardware which allows you

454
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,909
to consume policies which are set by the

455
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:53,260
backend on how an identity is defined

456
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:56,290
and how it is used to verify given user

457
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,410
for various applications so I really

458
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:02,500
need to make sure that you are who you

459
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:05,350
say you are when you're doing a very

460
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,230
sensitive transaction but I may not need

461
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,790
everything if I just need you to say

462
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,440
enter this class right I just need to

463
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,810
know that you're a part of student but

464
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,100
before we do some high-end bank

465
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,830
transaction they may want to see

466
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,199
something more so bending on the type of

467
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,159
services in this case whether it's OS

468
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,900
log on or logging onto VPN or we are

469
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,790
doing continuous authentication maybe

470
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,340
figure out where the user is there or

471
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,629
has a user left the system then we are

472
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,730
able to enforce the policies associated

473
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,790
with identity in the hardware and

474
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,410
release only that cryptographic token so

475
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,780
here is an example where you achieve

476
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,700
security and a very high level of

477
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,580
security because everything is protected

478
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:53,110
your identity is protected your decision

479
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,750
is protected and your enforcement is

480
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,570
there because you're sending a crypto

481
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:02,440
crypt or token which cannot be spooked

482
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:07,720
by anyone else more details please ask

483
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:12,430
me and I'll go over one particular use

484
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:16,870
case of how how this works so consider

485
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:20,730
this who knows how public key crypto

486
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:24,340
works everyone good so when you are

487
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,950
issuing certificates then you normally

488
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,010
don't know who is issuing it you just

489
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,390
know that you assume that the user is

490
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:34,330
got the private key somewhere secret

491
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,790
right the whole idea with the Intel

492
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,860
authenticate is to tie the certificate

493
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,740
with the user's identity so when we are

494
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,889
generating the key pair we ensure that

495
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,560
this key pair is associated with an

496
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:50,080
identity verification policy when that

497
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,149
happens when we issue that certificate

498
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,810
with that public key associated with the

499
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:58,990
user during verification say the app

500
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:01,960
which is the VPN app is requesting for a

501
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,330
sign operation at that point it will

502
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,820
send a challenge the challenge will

503
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,419
determine the object identifier think of

504
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,280
it as the policy associated with the

505
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,440
authentication requirement and it will

506
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,780
be sent to the identity engine the

507
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,540
identity engine will basically check in

508
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,920
this case what you have you know if you

509
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,850
have the right phone then you the right

510
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,190
user you can use the users face or pin

511
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,250
or anything else so as long as the

512
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,460
identity engine says yep the user is who

513
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,980
he or she says he is then we'll continue

514
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,160
and do the crypto operations associated

515
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,810
with those public/private key pairs so I

516
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,900
may be able to steal your key but I

517
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:46,480
cannot use it until that identity is

518
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,600
mapped correctly that's pretty neat

519
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,780
right for those who've done pki stuff

520
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,659
for a while so basically this is very

521
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,740
important consideration because this

522
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,740
allows you to fit with legacy

523
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,660
applications so one of the real world

524
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,670
things is you can't really do anything

525
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:07,500
from scratch you need to make sure it

526
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:11,650
integrates with existing environments so

527
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,020
so very quickly on when we were

528
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,090
deploying it there were a lot of aspects

529
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,129
of it that we had to cover we know

530
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,439
starting from making sure that the

531
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,360
packages can be deployed in an effective

532
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,830
fashion so it is not just a little

533
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,840
ingredient on the platform it's an

534
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,220
end-to-end solution being able to

535
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,520
associate it with authentication

536
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,160
policies that allow you to define and

537
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,840
scale from multiple applications to

538
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,450
multiple

539
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,639
dedication factors so thinking scale in

540
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,260
mind thinking integration in mind is

541
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,980
extremely important to bringing things

542
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,720
to the real world looking at the factor

543
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,789
management you know things have to be

544
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,409
managed you can't just do one often

545
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,289
expect everyone to sort of follow it

546
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:55,020
think think of how you would manage it

547
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,580
how do you patch it how it works with

548
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,129
the various peripherals and the various

549
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:04,789
drivers on the operating system because

550
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:07,980
there is no one size that fits all so

551
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:11,510
that was the end of the identity you

552
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,510
know deep dive any questions

553
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:29,950
so I'm interested in knowing how much is

554
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:31,988
the performance impact when you execute

555
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,539
those secure operations in trusted

556
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:38,679
execution environments which I have

557
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:40,570
looked into some available trust

558
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,359
execution environments in the platform

559
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:46,359
either those platinum do not allow

560
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,599
developers to access the trust to take

561
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,639
security maquon they are said to be slow

562
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,389
so i'm interested in knowing if the

563
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:58,418
Intel trusted execution platform

564
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:59,408
overcomes dozen bro yeah so it's a it's

565
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,869
something that we should do it's

566
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,419
excellent question the more security act

567
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:07,059
regardless of where you doing it

568
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:09,909
sometimes it slows down the system which

569
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,070
is where it is extremely important

570
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:14,440
especially as an identity solution to

571
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,629
get out of the users way let the user

572
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,960
access the system you know versus make

573
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:23,349
it even harder so that isn't so we have

574
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:28,479
very strong requirements on the

575
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:30,129
performance indicators so some of these

576
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:32,440
trusted execution environments don't do

577
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:35,379
everything right they will do the most

578
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,539
sensitive part of the operation and have

579
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:39,759
the rest of the CPU used soft make our

580
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,340
extensions for example runs on you know

581
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:46,809
it uses the entire cpu horsepower so

582
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:48,908
there's no but we can go case-by-case to

583
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:51,460
understand what exactly is the issue

584
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,109
because at least I don't believe there's

585
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,849
a silver bullet that you've got to use

586
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,830
this trusted execution environment for

587
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:59,049
everything I think its a mix and match

588
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,840
depending on the requirements and the

589
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:05,139
capabilities of that environment yes

590
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,039
please so whenever you need to perform

591
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:11,678
any sensitive operation you go from lon

592
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,559
secure vault to secure world so I mean I

593
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,830
mean your trusted execution environment

594
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,239
so I'm interested to know like how much

595
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,158
is the overhead whenever you switch

596
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:26,919
between two world because like I might

597
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,080
be running several other applications

598
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,510
which might get affected when I actually

599
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,490
have

600
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,450
to move from non-secure bottle secure

601
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,160
world yeah so our requirements again

602
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,080
from the performance perspective are

603
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,480
normally very strong sometimes we have

604
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,080
to do the operations in say 50

605
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,330
milliseconds and then get get it using

606
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,139
the crypto channel we do pre cashing

607
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:53,449
there depending on the type of operation

608
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,150
that you are doing they are ways of

609
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,800
optimizing it and it depends on what

610
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,060
kind of trusted execution environment

611
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,360
you're using I using a hardware-based

612
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:06,350
one a separate microprocessor are using

613
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,979
a virtualized partition using a separate

614
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,510
sensor so depending on the type of

615
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,900
trusted execution environment you would

616
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:17,330
be able to achieve the desired

617
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,660
performance and there's a lot of

618
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,730
advancement on that you know so it will

619
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,680
be worth doing a deep type to understand

620
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:31,270
exactly what that use cases I have a

621
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,300
question about your Intel authenticate

622
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:37,730
platform do you rely on TTP do you use

623
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:44,659
trusted third-party somehow in that

624
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:47,360
scheme yeah so there is a very

625
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:51,590
interesting it's a very good question so

626
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:55,939
there is a trust in the back end to have

627
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:59,929
set the policy correctly and it is a

628
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,240
very interesting way of ensuring that it

629
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:05,210
is not a blind trust it is also

630
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,700
associated with the attestation which

631
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:12,080
means that you you expect that my I

632
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,090
trusted to do having done the right job

633
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,909
but I'm still going to verify it and

634
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:20,020
using hardware based attestation so

635
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,940
there there's a trust but verify model

636
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:25,610
with the TTP that we have to have

637
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:28,940
because we the way we designed it is for

638
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:30,590
enterprises which allow admins to define

639
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,850
how you need to authenticate to your

640
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:37,309
system so it's sort of mix hard hardware

641
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,039
based technique and software-based

642
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,629
its a mix and match of both but

643
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,360
verification using heart rate based

644
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:46,039
techniques which will allow you to have

645
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,090
high assurance that you're not blindly

646
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:51,799
trusting it you're making it trustworthy

647
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,709
that's a great idea so it means that if

648
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,850
someone stole my private key it will not

649
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,620
work on malicious machine yeah we make

650
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,070
it hard for someone to steal your

651
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,529
private key so the motto is authenticate

652
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,269
locally as much as possible so nothing

653
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:10,549
leaves nothing sensitively is your

654
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,850
system and authorized globally based on

655
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:16,730
the tokens that you release to the world

656
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,668
so we try not to be moving migrating

657
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,039
private keys often but we carry out the

658
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:24,200
operations and intelligence locally so

659
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,720
that that's kind of that balance between

660
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,999
privacy and security like if I'm in the

661
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,919
sick in in a smart home and I'm trying

662
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:34,669
to do some intelligence it doesn't have

663
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:38,059
to always leave a certain boundary that

664
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:42,499
you define so private keys are along the

665
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:44,720
same lines second question what do you

666
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:48,440
think about zero knowledge proof of

667
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,200
indication when so the attestation is

668
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,009
exactly based on zero knowledge proofs

669
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,259
if you go back that that was the essence

670
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,330
of my thesis also is using aggregate

671
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:01,399
zero knowledge groups to take multiple

672
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,499
factors in a very efficient manner

673
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:06,529
without exponential increase in

674
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:09,080
computation by simple addition in the

675
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:12,350
exponent you could combine the various

676
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,320
types of attributes and do only one

677
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,840
proof and mud and show multiple factors

678
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,549
have been satisfied so the use of

679
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,149
anonymous credentials and zero knowledge

680
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,950
proof is extremely valuable the world is

681
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:29,928
not there yet but we will get it there

682
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:31,789
with one by one okay yeah and I think

683
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,889
zero knowledge Bruce is a great way of

684
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:36,200
getting that balance between security

685
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:39,248
and privacy it allows you the minimal

686
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,249
disclosure that you need as well

687
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,389
interest of time and I would love to

688
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,520
hear more comments by the way even after

689
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:49,350
the session I don't want to

690
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,090
I'm requesting your help you're already

691
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:56,669
in security your grad students I would

692
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,879
like to make sure that all of us are

693
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,750
ambassadors you know to show how the

694
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:08,480
cybersecurity careers and cybersecurity

695
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:10,800
research is well understood and folks

696
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,650
folks I spending more time especially

697
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,210
the undergrad as you are TAS and

698
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:20,130
advisors to some of the undergrad

699
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:21,570
community they there is security has

700
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,880
been there everywhere I was talking to

701
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,560
some folks earlier they're like it's not

702
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,540
as interesting big data is interesting

703
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,240
because it's new it's a new word and

704
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,670
security has been there forever but you

705
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,500
know what security is there's a constant

706
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,630
evolution the types of threats that are

707
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,480
happening the rise of attackers how well

708
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,730
organized they're becoming it scares the

709
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,540
hell out of me you know on what it can

710
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:49,170
do to our actual physical lives if you

711
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:52,740
don't take care of it there's more at

712
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,840
stake and there is a need to keep up

713
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,890
with it the role of governments the role

714
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:03,030
of you know the type of cyber offense

715
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:04,560
that affects everyone the I don't know

716
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:08,070
how many how many of you know people who

717
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:11,130
have been impacted by a security you

718
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:15,690
know some digital theft fraud some

719
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:18,840
attack and we have a victim right and we

720
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,700
added know a person or it's not like one

721
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,990
off somebody's password was stolen

722
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:27,418
almost every single person you know it's

723
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,759
it's not something that you can save

724
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,250
yourself by working in isolation so

725
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,929
there is there's definitely a lack of

726
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:38,399
talent and I have you know job Rex which

727
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,429
are open and looking for good security

728
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,889
talent and it's not there so it would be

729
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,100
very good and there is also a change in

730
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,440
direction I really like the code from

731
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,449
the Saturn and Ayla who says that the

732
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,030
next ten years we are going to take it

733
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:55,439
to a whole never from consuming various

734
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,200
technologies you know we were on this

735
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,420
side to being an age of a profound

736
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,410
creation the ability to

737
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,720
actually make things to make not just

738
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,848
rely on you know companies to make stuff

739
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,308
for us and us using it in every single

740
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:14,160
user my five-year-old loves to make

741
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:19,200
things you know nobody they expect to do

742
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,848
more and it's that age and I really like

743
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,160
this particular classroom it's one of

744
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:25,710
the more rare ones where there is a good

745
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,240
balance of diversity typically I'm

746
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,849
sitting and they're 50 people and

747
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,129
there's probably one woman you know so

748
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,280
your help in making sure that there is

749
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,500
diversity from every angle and there is

750
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,170
a lot of initiative from Intel to make

751
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,720
sure we have a diverse workplace it

752
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:46,200
enriches the environment plus it helps

753
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,439
in it is a really great way to work

754
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,750
together and encouraging co-workers is

755
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,480
it can be pretty intimidating for some

756
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,790
of the students especially women who are

757
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,030
in undergrad who will quickly switch to

758
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:03,829
something else unless we give them the

759
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:07,920
mentorship and guidance so this anything

760
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:09,660
which helps in bridging that gap would

761
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:16,020
be great and your ideas along those

762
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:20,000
lines would be well appreciated so and

763
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:23,069
now I would like to hand over to Ryan

764
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,930
who would talk about the Intel's maker

765
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:28,500
program so we talked about profound

766
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:30,359
creation here is an example of how we

767
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,750
can take it beyond the regular PCs

768
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,750
laptops and understand the make culture

769
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,430
thanks abhilasha appreciate being here

770
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm actually a program manager at Intel

771
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,899
in the chipset architecture group and I

772
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,940
kind of do this kind of stuff on the

773
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,490
side because I think it's fun and

774
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,040
exciting and it's just a plug for Intel

775
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,868
that's one thing that Intel does allows

776
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,940
for us to do things like this where I

777
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:08,280
can be involved in promoting makers and

778
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:11,069
and also I'm trying to promote and

779
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:15,740
improve diversity and technology over

780
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:15,740
the summer I was involved in a

781
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,790
all

782
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:26,750
with the local high school students

783
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,960
there so we did a two-week maker program

784
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:32,660
with them to try to get people early on

785
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,150
in technology and help them to

786
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,540
understand and know that this stuff is

787
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:41,720
fun cool and it can lead to excellent

788
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,310
job opportunities later in life so are

789
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,040
you guys all pretty much familiar with

790
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:49,190
what maker is in general is there anyone

791
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,900
that you guys have any of you have been

792
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,770
involved in any major projects or done

793
00:37:50,900 --> 00:38:00,700
any major projects at home a little bit

794
00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:02,660
what kind of things have you done okay

795
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,890
Raspberry Pi that's what I that's one of

796
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,379
the things I like to use so yeah so

797
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:11,240
maker culture it's kind of a philosophy

798
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,510
of learning by doing and it has its

799
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,089
roots and kind of do it yourself so

800
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,060
learn things by tinkering and putting

801
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,820
things together taking things apart and

802
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:24,850
it's been accelerated recently by like

803
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,280
low class electronic development kits

804
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,290
open source code 3d printing and a

805
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,400
collaborative economy are different ways

806
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:36,470
that that the maker culture has become

807
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,940
this big thing and now I don't know if

808
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,379
you've ever heard of Maker Faire that

809
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,090
happens every year there's actually

810
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,370
multiple ones throughout the country but

811
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,780
the main one is in the Bay Area so

812
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,470
thousands of people come and showcase

813
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:52,940
their creations much of it is art and

814
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:54,589
technology focused and it's just it's

815
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,860
just fun that's basically what it's

816
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:00,230
about so Intel's very involved in the

817
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,230
maker space and we're trying to become

818
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:06,680
more involved and we have quite a few

819
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:09,560
different products in that space one is

820
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,770
the Intel Arduino 101 another one is the

821
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,740
Intel Edison board and we just released

822
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,870
a new development kit which is a little

823
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:22,180
expensive for the maker side it's called

824
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:26,240
the Intel jewel kit and it has a lot of

825
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:28,970
image processing capabilities and other

826
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,439
things that make it interesting but like

827
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,169
I said it's a little bit more expensive

828
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,890
and so I just wanted to do a quick

829
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,800
little down

830
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,279
mo of a maker project that I did not do

831
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,360
but whoever did it is pretty awesome and

832
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,670
we'll just showcase that a little bit

833
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:49,310
and then it was talk a tiny bit more so

834
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,320
basically what this is is and you can

835
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,110
see on the screen there this is a rock

836
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,120
paper scissor robot so that you can play

837
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:59,450
rock paper scissor by yourself which

838
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,089
might not be that fun but it is fun to

839
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,580
build it so what we have here is an

840
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:08,180
Intel Edison sorry down here Intel

841
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:10,880
Edison board right here and inside of

842
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,899
this little blue box with the hand on it

843
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,030
is an Intel Arduino board and there's a

844
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:21,170
couple of little sensors here that

845
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,880
measure basically flex and if you figure

846
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,620
out rock paper scissor you can basically

847
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,410
tell everything you need to know from

848
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:32,630
just these two fingers whether you're

849
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:35,359
doing the paper or the hand which is

850
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,850
sorry paper scissors or rock you can

851
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:41,120
figure all that out from just these two

852
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:42,560
sensors here and so I'll try to get it

853
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,210
going sometimes it's a little finicky

854
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:52,040
but just put this on here so if you can

855
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:53,810
pan down camera down here so we got a

856
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,420
little screen there that shows you who

857
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:59,779
is so I'll push the button it'll count

858
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:03,110
down and I'm going to select rock and

859
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,300
you can see the two fingers went down so

860
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:09,130
he threw paper and that means that me

861
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:13,310
being player won I've won that round so

862
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:18,040
again just for sport I'll give it rock

863
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:23,180
again he did paper again not very smart

864
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:26,960
it looks like I won that round so that's

865
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,270
just a quick demo this was all this this

866
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,230
blue part here was all 3d printed and

867
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:39,320
has open source diagrams even this hand

868
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:41,660
here you can find open source not code

869
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,430
but plans that you can just load in your

870
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,140
3d printer and print it all out and then

871
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,440
there's just a couple of little motors

872
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,140
inside there

873
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,150
this screen so I think all of this

874
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,049
probably would cost may be less than a

875
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:56,700
hundred dollars to make and we think

876
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,380
it's an excellent way of getting more

877
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,730
people interested in technology and

878
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:07,040
improving diversity that Intel so I just

879
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,040
had one little other quick slide to show

880
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,140
so yeah the demo so yeah the most

881
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,000
important thing about being a maker is

882
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,150
you just find stuff on the web it's

883
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,920
freely available makers love to share

884
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,050
and they love people to copy what

885
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,119
they've done that's like a big you know

886
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:26,310
accomplishment if people are making what

887
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:30,660
you made and then you take that and you

888
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:33,359
iterate on it make it better one step at

889
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,129
a time I came up with some examples

890
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,200
security projects that are common out

891
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,829
there you can make your own home VPN

892
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,950
server home surveillance systems using

893
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:46,440
the Raspberry Pi are really big and you

894
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,359
could extend you know biometric scanners

895
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,950
to everyday items if you don't want your

896
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:52,049
roommate using your microwave or

897
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,819
something like that maybe you could

898
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:57,540
figure out a way of preventing that

899
00:42:53,819 --> 00:43:01,079
using an Arduino and fingerprint scanner

900
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,300
or something like that so the other

901
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,790
thing that that Intel is doing we have

902
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,220
America's greatest makers it's a TV show

903
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:13,440
on tnt I don't know have any of you

904
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:17,640
heard of it before we have 12 so it's

905
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,619
kind of like Shark Tank meets other

906
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,910
reality shows that you might have seen

907
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:27,599
people pitch ideas and they have mentors

908
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,799
that help them through the way and they

909
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,770
pick a winner in the winner gets a

910
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,540
million dollars to use however they want

911
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,190
they're not that they don't even have to

912
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,310
use it on their company and they're not

913
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,790
in any way I have to work with Intel

914
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:44,520
after that but they are open casting for

915
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,040
Intel makers so if you have any amazing

916
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,500
ideas that you'd like to present and go

917
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,250
to this website and see the shows for

918
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,470
one and to sign up and see if you your

919
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:00,410
idea might make it as America's greatest

920
00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:00,410
makers so thank you

921
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,070
we went through you know the topic of

922
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,400
identity and the various opportunities

923
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:15,430
over there just as one of the many areas

924
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,530
in cyber security I like it the most but

925
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:19,299
you know everybody comes from their own

926
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,859
different directions and everything is

927
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,470
extremely valuable and how it puts

928
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:25,930
together and cybersecurity just as a

929
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,939
field has so many opportunities risks

930
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:31,299
problems that really need to be solved

931
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:35,410
and they are there is a gap right so

932
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:37,330
highly encouraged deep comprehensive

933
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:40,930
research understanding the various

934
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:45,369
threat vectors and you yourself as

935
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:47,680
leaders to guide the way so if you have

936
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:49,900
any questions we are here after this

937
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,040
session happy to answer any more

938
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,090
questions but very much look forward to

939
00:44:53,040 --> 00:45:02,040
getting more and more cyber security

940
00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:02,040
experts coming out of Purdue thank you

941
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,900
you
