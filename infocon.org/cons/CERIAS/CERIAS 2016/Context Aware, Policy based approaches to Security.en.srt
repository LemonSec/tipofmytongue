1
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,030
I'll wait until they welcome to the

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,200
serious seminar for March 2nd today I'm

3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,320
honored to be able to introduce

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,760
Professor Otto pom Joshi who comes to us

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,790
from the University of Maryland

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,190
Baltimore County where he is the Soros

7
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,940
family poorest family professor

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,309
sano-sama you invented burrowsfamily

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,510
professor chair of the department and

10
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:01,230
director of their cybersecurity center

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,989
how he has a distinguished career but

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,450
that brings distinction not only to the

13
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,979
University of Maryland but also to

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:15,600
Purdue he started his career getting his

15
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:18,210
PhD here at Purdue and has since spent

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,520
some time here as visiting faculty at

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,009
the University of Missouri before he was

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,699
stolen away by University of Maryland so

19
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,179
I will turn it over to Jesse thank you

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,270
so much Chris it's an honor to be back

21
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:35,399
to see all the changes and it's a

22
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,869
dangerous thing to be lecturing in front

23
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,729
of the algorithms guru who taught me all

24
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:51,840
about the peer a model I still remember

25
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:54,959
it so so I'm going to talk about while

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,739
you see the topic there but I was told

27
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,110
that this is an interdisciplinary

28
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,560
audience with not just a bunch of

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,209
hardcore Khan science people so the talk

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,670
will be pitched that way if you think

31
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,140
it's getting too far away and you want

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,440
some technical details all you have to

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:16,110
do is to raise your hand so here are the

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,349
things that I want you to remember first

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:24,239
the traditional access control models

36
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:29,040
are inadequate in many circumstances and

37
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,800
you'll see why I say that so that's

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,900
what's wrong and then there is what's

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,670
right so context aware and policy driven

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,000
approaches can make sense for complex

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,738
security and privacy situations policy

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,299
is in that self-evident most

43
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,640
organizations of policies you know if

44
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,960
you go

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,279
I tap at Purdue and say what's your

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,620
security policy they'll produce a

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,950
document when you sign up for an account

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,630
at Purdue you get this big I don't know

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:03:00,540
if you read it but you get this big

50
00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:00,540
stuff to read I can yes I can do that

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,929
yes thank you so so policies can be

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,350
captured in the form that computers can

53
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,020
understand right not pieces of text but

54
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,970
ways that computers can ingest and

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,470
reason over and I'll illustrate this

56
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,480
using three scenarios mobile security

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,640
intrusion detection and regular security

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,010
I'll spend most of my time on the first

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,890
one mobile security but as time permits

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,570
of move on and as typically happens in

61
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,480
these talks I have way more slides than

62
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,100
we have time so I'll be selective in in

63
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,810
what I tell you some of those are

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,850
details that may not make sense so let's

65
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,680
let's talk of mobile device security

66
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,900
right so I'll start with the last

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,940
statement and I'll promise you that this

68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,769
slide is about two years old so we've

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,079
been saying this for a while but now

70
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,850
it's famous because Tim Cook said it you

71
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,400
know when he was contesting the federal

72
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,370
government a warrant on unlocking the

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,829
cell phone of that person who committed

74
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,000
the atrocities in San Bernardino you

75
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,500
know they're basically saying oh my god

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,360
this smartphone knows so much about you

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,910
if the government gets access to it it's

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,950
disastrous right so without offering an

79
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,600
opinion on that particular thing the

80
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,798
point is that your smart phone knows a

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,750
lot more about you right broadly these

82
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,359
have been used for participating sensing

83
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,919
systems where our phones are

84
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,340
individually collecting data but then

85
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,859
collaborating in some way to do better

86
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:37,030
things and which is great which is

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,710
fantastic fairly simple things forget

88
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,270
the complex sensors that are engendered

89
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,460
by Internet of Things but Microsoft

90
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,930
Research did an experiment about a

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,599
little less than a decade ago now in

92
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,070
India well they were trying to estimate

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,850
the amount of traffic on the road and

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,550
it's very hard to put sensors

95
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,470
right and they cost a lot so what they

96
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,630
did was they built a little app turned

97
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,190
on everyone's cell phone mic and they

98
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,600
recorded the amount of honking you are

99
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,660
hearing so for those of you from India

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,480
when you are stuck in a jam you hoc you

101
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,400
know what when you don't find your way

102
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,850
you honk to see if people will give way

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,640
and simply by measuring the amount of

104
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,170
honking noise the amount of noise you're

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,849
hearing from horns they were able to

106
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,670
very successfully predict the amount of

107
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,790
traffic on the road right great example

108
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,340
of participatory sensing that's a simple

109
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,520
example just think today of how much

110
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,500
information my phone through GPS knows

111
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,380
where I am

112
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,670
through proximity you know Chris Chris's

113
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,640
phone probably also has a Bluetooth

114
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:47,180
device you know I can sense his

115
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,560
Bluetooth Mac ID I may not know who it

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,920
belongs to but I have a sense of who it

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,720
is at least traffic analysis can be done

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,780
my phone has Google Calendar which you

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,580
know says what I was doing it actually

120
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,080
read my email and Google very helpfully

121
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,550
read my email and said oh you're staying

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,800
at this hotel in Indy tonight and

123
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,810
inserted that into my calendar right so

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,530
there's a lot of information that that

125
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,390
exists so the thing is smart mobile

126
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,359
devices know great deal about their

127
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,740
users including their current context

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,240
acquiring and reasoning about this

129
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,230
context helps them provide better

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,490
services that's why we allow them and

131
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,170
also sharing this information with

132
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,600
others can be good so what we are trying

133
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,450
to do is to say let's leverage this idea

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,970
of context and make the protection

135
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,880
policies context aware so that you can

136
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,420
limit not just information sharing but

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,760
actually access to the actions and

138
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,050
information right so we're sort of

139
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,860
trying to say let's leverage this

140
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:48,860
context piece so what do we do and

141
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,230
you'll see some details later but we use

142
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,910
decorative policies that can access the

143
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,350
users profile and context model for

144
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,730
privacy and security we one of the

145
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,130
things we do is to limit information

146
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,860
sharing so in certain certain situations

147
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,320
will share some aspect of the

148
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,390
information but we also use the same

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,719
policy infrastructure to control actions

150
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,130
things like

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,140
you're not allowed to have your phone

152
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:18,810
ring while you're listening to a talk

153
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,250
that's an action control you know what

154
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,640
part of the world I come from when my

155
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,730
slides say for me so these Chris knows

156
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,520
what part of the world I come from and

157
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,870
what agency that is in certainly

158
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,210
interested in privacy but from what

159
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,430
perspective you know we can argue that

160
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,830
we that we interact with a lot but you

161
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,480
know we forget that simple permit

162
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,340
Facebook uploads while at home but not

163
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,370
in the meeting these are kind of things

164
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,250
you would want to do so so that you

165
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,330
first need to figure out you know what

166
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,890
the court what where I am and

167
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,450
traditionally if you look at the phone

168
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,219
models they have been like you're at

169
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,840
this GPS coordinate but we're talking

170
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,160
about something much of issue I'm in

171
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,539
Purdue University which is in West

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,310
Lafayette which is in Indiana which is

173
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,750
the United States I'm participating in a

174
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,030
talk you can infer that from my sensors

175
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,060
you know Chris is here Lisa was there I

176
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,950
met Elise I met Anna Kate dr. Atala is

177
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,470
there so yeah there are a bunch people

178
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,479
here I could figure that out I can

179
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,000
figure out that I'm following a speaker

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,530
role by scraping the web somewhere in

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,730
the serious web page there's probably an

182
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,080
announcement that says I'm going to give

183
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:31,350
a talk today you just have to scrape the

184
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:33,710
weapon I have that so what we do is we

185
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:38,550
define an ontology

186
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:40,740
to capture this rich notion of place the

187
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,689
distinction we're trying to make is GPS

188
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,280
coordinates at a position what you're

189
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,420
really interested in this context thing

190
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,250
is a place what is a place it's a it's a

191
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,930
conceptual place it sits around what

192
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,640
location you are in certainly but what

193
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,060
activities you're doing what roles

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,040
you're playing in those activities and

195
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,630
so activities I've got it places and

196
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,699
involve users filling particular roles

197
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,010
so we capture this kind of information

198
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,170
in an ontology which we can instantiate

199
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,560
from the sense data on our mobile

200
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,930
devices right and then this you know

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,459
I'll skip this but it begins to look

202
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:20,040
something like this once you put it in

203
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:22,500
notation three so what I don't want to

204
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,279
spend time today on is how do you go

205
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,959
from this kind

206
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,790
low-level sense knowledge to

207
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,768
higher-level context we have done some

208
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,259
work but there's a rich body of

209
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,600
literature of people whose job is to say

210
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,189
if I see this information from your

211
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,139
sensors then this is what you must be

212
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:42,180
doing right what I'm trying to do is to

213
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:45,480
say how can I make this effect privacy

214
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,839
and I'll start with okay this picture is

215
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,050
old but nothing much has changed right

216
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,519
so if you look at the current version of

217
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,779
Android I'm gonna pick on Android

218
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,550
because that's why we do a lot of our

219
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,819
work and our development and because

220
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:04,378
it's easy to do what happens when you

221
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:10,139
install an app it asks for a bunch of

222
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:13,889
permissions and what do you do I've done

223
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:17,730
this kind of thing in places where there

224
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,529
are fairly senior security aware people

225
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:24,120
sitting and you know most people will go

226
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:26,040
yes how many of you even know that in

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,680
the latest version of Android you can

228
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:33,240
retroactively lis remove permissions and

229
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:39,689
this is an audience attending a security

230
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,829
seminar imagine what is happening so you

231
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:43,649
need to go to the latest version of

232
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,359
Android but again you know speaking on

233
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,879
Android but the same thing is true in

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,329
iOS the same thing is true in Windows 10

235
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,910
or whatever else you mean the model is

236
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:56,160
at install time I will ask you for a

237
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:03,420
bunch of permissions and from then on

238
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:06,540
those permissions stay static so what

239
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,509
we're trying to do is to stick something

240
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,209
into the android framework i should

241
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,279
really draw a diagram a box below here

242
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:18,119
saying the linux kernel because for some

243
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,050
things we need to do they're better done

244
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,759
in the linux kernel

245
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:26,219
we're trying to stay away right now

246
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:27,959
because one it complicates things there

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,629
too a kernel compiled in addition to an

248
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,349
android framework compiled and then and

249
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:35,850
routing but for the computer science

250
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,020
types amongst you imagine there was a

251
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,220
box that said

252
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,829
colonel and some of the stuff could

253
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,000
happen there right so you have you

254
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:48,540
basically stick things in between that

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
take the part that is doing the context

256
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:57,959
reasoning to figure out what the context

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,400
is take the policies that are coming in

258
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,140
and so you have some knowledge base that

259
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,840
have policies that are applicable in

260
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:09,930
various contexts and then you reason

261
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:15,180
over it to decide whether an action is

262
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:18,959
either allowed or not allowed or allowed

263
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,150
in some generalizable form so I'll make

264
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,440
that clear in a little bit what what I

265
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,310
mean by that but you have the policy

266
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,230
decision point and then you have a

267
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,050
policy enforcement point and that

268
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:37,470
enforcement point could do

269
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:40,709
generalizations and this is what so if

270
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,750
you go back a few slides this is what it

271
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,450
actually looks like to the system now

272
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,150
we're not user interface people but even

273
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,740
we recognize that telling even a

274
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,140
computer science person to say write

275
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,980
something like this up to describe what

276
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,780
your policy is is not going to work so

277
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,660
what you have is things like this where

278
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,640
we you know we can read the underlying

279
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,560
ontology automatically and populate a

280
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,199
user interface saying the places of

281
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,719
interest in Purdue are lawson building

282
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,560
whatever the model gym is called now

283
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,200
stuart you know PM you so on and so

284
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,640
forth or if the same thing shifts to a

285
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,920
different University we can instantiate

286
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,510
what this is we can instantiate the

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,130
activities that have to be controlled we

288
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,020
can instantiate the devices that have to

289
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,780
be controlled and we provide a little

290
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,910
user interface that it's not the best

291
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,100
design users user interface but the idea

292
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,630
is that it's a user interface that lets

293
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:44,280
you compile down those policies let me

294
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:47,250
come to that a little bit later so this

295
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,560
is an example of what that interface

296
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,990
looks like and then what can happen is

297
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,489
and this is just some screenshots to

298
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,850
show you that the system works is that

299
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,830
you know as the the as the request comes

300
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,270
we dynamically reason over the policy

301
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:07,000
and the context to decide whether to

302
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:09,069
permit or deny it you know one of the

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,290
criticisms that you run into when you do

304
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,970
this kind of sort of a I meet security

305
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,680
work yes this is too heavy you can't run

306
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,410
it on your mobile device it'll eat all

307
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,050
the battery it just won't run well we

308
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,240
have done significant experiments by

309
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,829
running a jenna prototype on android and

310
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,870
we've been doing this for the last three

311
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,210
or four years at least where there is

312
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:37,000
very little battery extra battery

313
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:39,400
drainage so what are the kind of let me

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,140
give you some examples of the kind of

315
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,340
policies that we're talking about and

316
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,300
then I'll show you know over how do you

317
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,300
actually implement them

318
00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:02,839
for a moment I thought I had the wrong

319
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:06,199
slides so imagine that you're a student

320
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,790
here I don't see too many undergraduates

321
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,979
able to put yourself in their shoes and

322
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,219
imagine that your parents are paying for

323
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,509
your education right they might want to

324
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,389
know whether you're attending classes or

325
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:22,029
not and so they might want to query your

326
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:24,529
device saying where it's on so right now

327
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,660
you might want to write a policy so

328
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,149
right now you have two choices right

329
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,759
when you install the tell my mom where I

330
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:33,680
am app you can either give it the

331
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
permission to see what your location is

332
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,810
or not give it the permission to see

333
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,389
where your location isn't if you say no

334
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:48,258
no bad repercussions so what you really

335
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:51,800
want to say is yeah if it's between sort

336
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:56,290
of normal school hours and I'm in the

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,310
class that I'm supposed to be in then

338
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,779
right and now notice this is very

339
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,569
different from a standard access control

340
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,160
model we can be and what I'll show you

341
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:07,430
later is it can be ground down to that

342
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,790
you we come of it sort of from a

343
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,859
standard full first-order logic model

344
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,439
but we can we can ground this out in a

345
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,050
little bit in the security models but

346
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,370
that's what you really want and that's

347
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,560
what we are permitting we're letting you

348
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,370
write these policies and then we build

349
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,649
this thing in between so the now for the

350
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,920
security oriented folks amongst you with

351
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:32,209
a little bit computer science background

352
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,250
we do both mandatory and discretionary

353
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,768
control so what you're seeing is an

354
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,100
example of a discretionary control right

355
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:43,970
you decide you control your location you

356
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,329
decide who to tell it but we also permit

357
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,009
mandatory policies to come in where

358
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,809
Purdue has issued you a laptop or a

359
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:56,379
tablet or whatever and Purdue might have

360
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:58,939
some policies saying you know if if

361
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,470
professor Prabhakar asks where a faculty

362
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,569
member is at any given time in his

363
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,199
department data information must be

364
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:08,639
reported accurately no matter what the

365
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,770
user has said

366
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,360
so you can do things like don't share

367
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:18,599
users context if they're in a particular

368
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:22,649
place the other thing that I was getting

369
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,329
at earlier is so go back to that example

370
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,689
that maybe the easiest way to think

371
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:30,418
about it go back to the example of my

372
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,360
mom is asking whether where I am right

373
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,100
now when I'm supposed to be in a class

374
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:40,770
but I'm actually hanging out in Chauncey

375
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,899
Hill right so so traditionally you see

376
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,990
two options you can write a policy that

377
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,419
says don't give her that answer or give

378
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,150
her that answer we permit a third kind

379
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,929
of policy that says tell her I am in

380
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:58,320
Lafayette o West Lafayette which is a

381
00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:03,179
correct answer but it generalizes the

382
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,740
response and obfuscates it right now

383
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,770
I'll be honest and confess that we're

384
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,600
not the obfuscation researchers but

385
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,580
there are enough people who have worked

386
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,809
on how you want to generalize and

387
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,449
obfuscate and there's some of them

388
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,789
sitting right here right so the idea is

389
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,880
we like the policy on top that says

390
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,470
obfuscate and for spatial and temporal

391
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,630
things those office Cashion's are

392
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,200
trivial and straightforward I mean you

393
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,659
can see them yourself I could say I'm in

394
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,370
this room g52 or whatever it is I could

395
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,289
say I'm an Stewart I could say I am in

396
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,939
Purdue I could say I'm in West Lafayette

397
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,890
I could say I mean the spatial

398
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,590
generalizations are obvious the temporal

399
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,470
generalizations are obvious - what we

400
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,168
also build in our system and this is

401
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,830
what changes domain to domain is capture

402
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:52,260
in ontology x' generalizations for other

403
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:57,030
kinds of activity classes so we're able

404
00:18:52,260 --> 00:19:01,320
to say I meant giving a talk right now

405
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,820
or I'm working right now or I'm busy

406
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,450
right now all of these are correct

407
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,149
answers they're generalizations of the

408
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,850
correct information and this is an

409
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,080
example of that where you have to build

410
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,908
so I mean spatial and temporal are

411
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,740
obvious but you have to build this the

412
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:19,980
other thing we build here is sort of a

413
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,950
visibility model right so it's it's a

414
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,570
more newer

415
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,640
this model that I'm describing to you

416
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,080
right now but I don't necessarily want

417
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,860
to get into that level of technical

418
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,120
details where what you're saying is you

419
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,959
can define classes of visibility and

420
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,699
then have these things associated with

421
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,480
visibility so in addition to having a

422
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,610
hierarchy of activities for example you

423
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,120
can also ascribe visibilities and

424
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:51,129
subclasses of visibility to each of

425
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,629
these and they don't have to be at this

426
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,060
I mean you can't you don't have to say

427
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,710
everything at this level is completely

428
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,230
private and everything in this level is

429
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,020
you know public you could describe

430
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:05,470
hierarchy layer visibility labels to

431
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:09,700
different points in the hierarchy okay

432
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,860
so this is I think what I was describing

433
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,690
to you a little bit earlier you know

434
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:18,010
share GPS coordinates only if I'm in my

435
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:21,430
office and so on and so forth so so how

436
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,200
does this work so one of the

437
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,140
contributions is how do you route write

438
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,880
these policies in ways that will make

439
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,900
sense to a secure so when you when we

440
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:36,090
started this work we would we would do

441
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,680
this and I'd go to a security type

442
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,320
conference or seminar like this one and

443
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:45,160
someone say we you just said access

444
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,990
control so is this our back is that our

445
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,030
T back is that you know whatever one of

446
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,330
those flavors what what kind of access

447
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:56,290
control are you talking about

448
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:58,240
so and our answer was this is more

449
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,290
complex but if the closest you want to

450
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
come to it will be something like a

451
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,780
tribute based access control because you

452
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,920
are defining arbitrary attributes and

453
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:11,139
deciding access based on that so the

454
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,630
formal methods we use is without right

455
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,610
ontology is an owl and then you

456
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,560
specialize mechanisms such as generals

457
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,169
as well a rare for Ray and we have used

458
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,240
various of these in the past for those

459
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,520
of you who are not familiar this came

460
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,910
this is public domain now but came out

461
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,830
of research in HP Labs this was a w3c

462
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,020
innovation and this was another w3c

463
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,070
innovation this is what we did with our

464
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,900
former student Alana she's a

465
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,330
principal research scientist at MIT now

466
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,890
and has been developing the smart

467
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,480
further so all of these inherit formal

468
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:50,600
semantics that are grounded out in

469
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,970
logics typically model logics so Ray

470
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,919
which is the work we did was grounded

471
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,250
out in modal logics where everything

472
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,800
would be reducible to oblige obligations

473
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,720
dispensations and you know things of

474
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,030
that nature

475
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,220
but we as I was saying we've now worked

476
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,720
to ground this out and security model so

477
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,190
we did some joint work with ravi son - a

478
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,530
few years ago and then his colleagues

479
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,720
will call Winnsboro who unfortunately

480
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:22,940
passed away which was in sac mat which

481
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,560
shows that you can use these kinds of

482
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,210
policies that I was just writing and

483
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,510
essentially captured the entirety of the

484
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,300
role based access control model so your

485
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,250
if you want to restrict yourself to are

486
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,780
back only you can write policies that

487
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,400
make sense we're now working on

488
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,310
attribute based access control we have

489
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,520
done the a back alpha model and just

490
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:45,100
published it and we're almost done with

491
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,490
showing that you can capture lis a back

492
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,969
paid a model and if you want to

493
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,470
understand let me do a quick survey how

494
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,850
many of you here know about attribute

495
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,810
based access control or road based

496
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,260
access control is that my phone yes it

497
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,260
is my phone

498
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,409
so not everyone who doesn't know our

499
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,570
back in a vac and things like that

500
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,409
no just one person well then you can ask

501
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:19,399
your friend sorry but this shot shot and

502
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:23,419
long and this is a Mac is basically

503
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:28,010
saying people with black hair should be

504
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:29,419
allowed to access something our back is

505
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,649
saying full professors and the

506
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,909
department should be allowed to access

507
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:36,559
something otherwise everything is

508
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:40,029
reduced to the individual users and

509
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,070
discretion are your mandatory control so

510
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:45,250
I apologize for this slide and you see

511
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,200
my other alma mater

512
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,429
logo there because this is a I spent a

513
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,899
sabbatical year there I'm actually

514
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:55,429
supervising a student this is IIT Delhi

515
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,408
so this is some work that was done by

516
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,419
Ravi Sandow and his student Shin was I

517
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,000
think the first author that proposed the

518
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:04,340
A Beka alpha model which said look there

519
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,710
are users who have users attributes the

520
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,000
users create subjects which have subject

521
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,279
attributes which they inherit from the

522
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,919
user and then there are objects with

523
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,110
object attributes and then you have a

524
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,090
policy and an authorization model right

525
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:21,080
so can you write policies in our

526
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,830
language that will capture this and the

527
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,809
answer is you can so that's the next

528
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,970
quiz how many of you heard of RDF or owl

529
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:33,950
or two people okay this I might have to

530
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:39,620
laughs three people

531
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:41,570
yes I might have to say so RDF is was a

532
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,949
proposal from who's heard of the

533
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:47,840
Semantic Web just a few more people

534
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,220
knowledge that just frames and I mean

535
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,939
you remember it frames from your AI

536
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:56,330
class you know some some people do right

537
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,419
so a quick version of this is this is a

538
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,279
way to capture ontology x' which are

539
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,929
formal ways of representing things in

540
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,049
the world and relationships between them

541
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:08,720
right there is a thing called a user and

542
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,850
then there is a thing called an object

543
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,529
and a user has certain access rights on

544
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,980
object because you have to write this

545
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,980
formally

546
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,769
so when we're reducing a back alpha

547
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,320
we're creating and this is something

548
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:27,500
called notation 3 which is you can write

549
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,658
the same gobbledygook in XML which is

550
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,450
what gets a computer to consume it this

551
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:34,460
is just an easier way for humans to read

552
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,890
this so you're saying a user is a class

553
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,649
a subject as a class an object is a

554
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,470
class in a permission as a class a user

555
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:51,370
attribute is a property that is defined

556
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:54,380
on a user etc then there is an action

557
00:25:51,370 --> 00:26:00,979
right which is a class and notice what

558
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:02,690
am I saying it's action has a property

559
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,779
that it's subject it's a functional

560
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,580
property whose domain is action and

561
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:13,130
range is subject and it is another

562
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:14,449
property it has an object right so

563
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,639
there's a subject and an object with

564
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,919
every action there is a subject

565
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:20,769
requesting that action on that object so

566
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:26,419
you're beginning to formally capture

567
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:28,070
these kinds of things so simple things

568
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,549
discretionary access control right

569
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,408
discretionary access control is Joe is

570
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,269
allowed to access something and you know

571
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:37,010
your readers your writers things you can

572
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:39,740
you can define various action classes

573
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,740
that you want but here are two kinds of

574
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,500
you know attributes and what you can do

575
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,639
is you can say this you can say

576
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,519
essentially this is your policy to

577
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:54,139
capture DAC says an object can be

578
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,700
written only by subject whose users are

579
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:58,490
in the writer list of that object and

580
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,870
this is how you would capture it in our

581
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,429
framework so what we're showing is that

582
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,260
this kind of framework of writing

583
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:06,470
policies and we want to write very

584
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,120
generalizable policies but to make to

585
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,529
make to have this make sense to the

586
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,000
security people you want to be able to

587
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,409
show this grounding and for

588
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,370
discretionary access control it's easy

589
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:21,260
to show mandatory access control becomes

590
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:23,629
a little bit harder but you can do it so

591
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,360
in this case we've this hopefully people

592
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,159
will remember from their security /

593
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,449
distributed operating systems class

594
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,020
right the Bella padula

595
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:35,870
model and now this is writing an

596
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,830
ontology to capture the Bella padula

597
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,820
model and then this is your policy

598
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,290
subject as a lot took quite a read

599
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,610
permission an object only if the

600
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,970
object's sensitivity is less than or

601
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:55,969
equal to the subject clearance you can

602
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:58,640
capture that in this framework I will

603
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,410
spare you some details but for those of

604
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,540
you who are who have done a security

605
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,250
course and have done our back one of the

606
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,700
big things is some say the static

607
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:14,810
separation of duties right which is

608
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:18,320
basically saying that a person who is a

609
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:20,000
citizen cannot also be a permanent

610
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,520
resident you're either citizen or

611
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,110
permanent resident right and it becomes

612
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,540
actually very easy to express this

613
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,050
because you just express it disjoint

614
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,510
with relationship between those two

615
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:34,370
classes and now your system will reason

616
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:40,310
over this automatically you can do the

617
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:44,209
same thing for TS or D this is flat our

618
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:48,370
back you're basically saying a person is

619
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:54,620
allowed to access this if they are a

620
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:58,699
full professor right and you can check

621
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:00,409
that you can do some reasoning and

622
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,140
inference here now in role based access

623
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,060
control so what if I said people who are

624
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,300
members of the faculty are allowed to

625
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:10,190
access this what about someone who

626
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,770
presents a credential or role saying

627
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,810
they're an assistant professor well as

628
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,000
long as in my ontology I capture the

629
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:19,820
fact that an assistant professor is a

630
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,710
kind of a faculty is a subclass of

631
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,710
faculty I can reason over this

632
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,030
so here is so a back captures all of

633
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,990
this and add stuff and one of the things

634
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:41,250
that adds this for example object

635
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:43,020
attribute modification constraints for

636
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,910
object attribute modifications while

637
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,129
you're running and basically saying only

638
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:58,590
certain people are allowed to do certain

639
00:29:47,130 --> 00:30:02,720
things at a given time so this is about

640
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:08,250
two years old but it shows you something

641
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,230
this is where we actually are and krisis

642
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,540
spend some time in Washington flying in

643
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,620
and out of BWI so he recognizes that

644
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,110
this is this is i-95 right here this is

645
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,899
195 come from BWI Airport and we are

646
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:26,610
right here our campus this is where we

647
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:29,910
actually are that's no few but we wrote

648
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,790
a policy on our device saying if Google

649
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,170
Maps asks for our location then this is

650
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:39,149
a simple policy tell them we're in San

651
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:40,740
Francisco right and based on that system

652
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,690
architecture I showed you we're sitting

653
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,800
in the middle when the request comes how

654
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,520
anyone had program in Android so on

655
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,760
Android you can essentially capture

656
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,950
androids RPC mechanism essentially index

657
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,360
so you can sit there listen for intents

658
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:06,330
and say the map application just

659
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:09,149
broadcast an intent to the GPS thing GPS

660
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,820
service wanting the GPS coordinate or

661
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:15,060
sitting right in the middle we capture

662
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,590
it and in this case the policy is

663
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,570
trivial tell them we're in San Francisco

664
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:23,220
we just read off the San Francisco GPS

665
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:25,080
coordinates and send them back but this

666
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,640
policy could be made arbitrarily complex

667
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,889
you could say if Chris is asking if the

668
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,090
app owned by Chris in this case is these

669
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:37,800
apps are what are the subjects in in the

670
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,189
Android world so you can say if an app

671
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:45,600
on by Chris is asking tell them where

672
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,430
here if in some cases you might just

673
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,129
want to generalize you know the example

674
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:54,300
I gave you earlier tell tell them tell

675
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:56,670
mom you know I'm in West Lafayette right

676
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,790
so randomly pick a point in West

677
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,590
Lafayette and return that as an answer

678
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:05,149
so we sit in the middle we take these

679
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,959
complex policies which are reducible to

680
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,760
you know which I showed you are

681
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:16,980
reducible to traditional security models

682
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:18,930
and we change our stuff and I think I

683
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,730
showed you this earlier as unfortunately

684
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:25,860
got duplicate it so what I want to pick

685
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,360
from here is as I said originally when I

686
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,120
showed you the slide I said the reason

687
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,189
we want writing these policies is hard

688
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,870
policy engineering is hard right

689
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,460
just like software engineering is hard

690
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,179
and security generally is hard policy

691
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:44,040
engineering is hard what's a good policy

692
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:45,930
right should Apple be you know releasing

693
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,240
the information on that bad guys iPhone

694
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,100
to the government whether or not you do

695
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,870
it as a policy that's an example of a

696
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,389
real policy that you have to reason over

697
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,830
right and what happens in real world the

698
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,890
policies are ambiguous they're written

699
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,659
in English and the final world will come

700
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,270
in this case I think from the Supreme

701
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,010
Court a bunch of people interpreting

702
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,300
that policy saying this is what that

703
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,820
policy really means right

704
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,950
so policies can be very complex and I

705
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,780
want to just as a little as I tell you

706
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,720
that this former student I was talking

707
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,700
to about Lana you know longer right yeah

708
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,180
so long as handsome could work well in

709
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,630
one cases she took most parts of HIPAA

710
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,740
and reduced it into something like this

711
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,590
for those of you are not familiar it's

712
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,610
the Health Insurance Portability privacy

713
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,899
every time you go to a doctor you have

714
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,490
to sign something saying they've given

715
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,740
you what their privacy policies are and

716
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,390
again if you're like most people you

717
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,650
don't actually read that you just the

718
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,180
doctor gives you a bunch of forms you

719
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,770
fill your name in the right places and

720
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,180
sign in you gave it back but you're

721
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,040
actually agreeing that to the whatever

722
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,540
their privacy policy is which I'm sure

723
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,070
the doctor and his staff has no idea

724
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,668
what it is it's just whatever the idea I

725
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,918
gave them right so

726
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:59,399
and HIPAA is pages and pages and pages

727
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,929
of United States code so it's very

728
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:06,029
complex so you want to capture those

729
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:08,299
kinds of policies when you start you're

730
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:12,329
probably not going to get it right right

731
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:15,029
so in in the real world you go to court

732
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:16,589
you have judges rule and you've courts

733
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:18,690
of Appeal and I need the Supreme Court

734
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:20,069
and if you don't like what's happened

735
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,629
there you can go back to the legislature

736
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:23,849
and have the legislature we draft the

737
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:26,460
law or you know clarify the law and or

738
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:28,200
you have agencies that interpret now in

739
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,179
this case who's doing all of this work

740
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,949
so I just painted a beautiful picture

741
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,168
for you Oh policy based access control

742
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,518
no problems just right policy is saying

743
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:37,649
my mom is not allowed to do something

744
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,788
whatever how do you know that's the

745
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:42,750
right policy how did you write that

746
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:45,539
policy how did you start and so that's a

747
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,768
really hard and open question there is

748
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,289
some work that's beginning to happen

749
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:51,808
saying can you take any apply machine

750
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:54,569
learning to this right can you take the

751
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:56,329
actions that a user does or does not do

752
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:59,759
on their smartphone for example and

753
00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:03,240
infer from that what their access

754
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:04,740
control policy is it's a hard thing to

755
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,578
do but people are beginning to grapple

756
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,649
with that problem right we're starting

757
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:14,250
with something simple right we're saying

758
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:17,339
I may not know exactly what your policy

759
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,589
is but I might have a reasonable

760
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,269
estimation or the organization I come

761
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,950
from would have a reasonable estimation

762
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,828
soper do you might have a reasonable

763
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:29,009
estimation of what policies it permits

764
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:33,680
or its employees are supposed to follow

765
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:40,230
and which of those are subject to some

766
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:43,649
change you must follow on you must fly

767
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:46,309
on a United States flag carrier whether

768
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,359
you fly United or Delta or whatever is

769
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,940
maybe the default will say you will

770
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,400
always fly United but you'll notice that

771
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,079
you know Chris in this case is flying

772
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,210
his own plane and you will say well

773
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,200
there's an exception for that the

774
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:04,710
policies is amended so what we've now

775
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,939
built and these are brand new so you're

776
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,660
seeing the latest version of Android

777
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,569
here

778
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,368
right this is a lollipop what we've

779
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:14,730
built is a thing where we start from a

780
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:17,460
default policy we'd let that policy run

781
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:22,079
sort of in an observational mode right

782
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:26,759
so the policy said don't pick up calls

783
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,440
when you're in a faculty meeting and I

784
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:30,509
noticed you don't pick up most calls but

785
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,420
I noticed that certain calls are picked

786
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:36,140
up so we capture what are called

787
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,369
violations of the policy and

788
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,160
periodically we report the violation to

789
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,829
the user saying boss the policy you said

790
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,509
that applies here doesn't really seem to

791
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:53,130
be the case there are there are

792
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:54,150
violations now because our policy is one

793
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,980
of the nice things because we are

794
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,539
capturing here in the formal model that

795
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,079
is grounded in our ontology and what is

796
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:04,019
you know so if the policy says don't

797
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,819
pick up phone calls from anyone you can

798
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:07,319
say well what do you want to change do

799
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:10,619
you want to say this rule is bad now

800
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,509
it's okay to pick up calls you said

801
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,930
don't pick up phone calls in a faculty

802
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:17,910
meeting did you mean to say except for

803
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,700
faculty meetings that happen on in the

804
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,618
month of May because you know again we

805
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,779
can do this kind of reasoning around

806
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,839
whether certain constraints on the

807
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:30,119
policies have to be relaxed or tightened

808
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,009
because those policies are drawn from

809
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,549
this ontology that we have instead of

810
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:38,039
this formal formalism that we have or

811
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:41,720
did you really mean that this phone call

812
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:44,099
was from your wife or your husband and

813
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,038
that's why you're making the exception

814
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,819
so the rule should really say don't pick

815
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,369
up calls in a faculty meeting unless

816
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:55,230
right so we can we guide the user

817
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,480
through this process and give them

818
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,130
options at various stages because it's

819
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,049
from drawn from an ontology did you have

820
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,170
a question Chris yeah one of the things

821
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:06,119
that that I see in this is in order to

822
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,640
capture that there's a violation don't

823
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,619
you have to not enforce the policy right

824
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,910
so okay that's what I'm saying it's an

825
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,369
excellent point in case I didn't make it

826
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,368
clear we start in an observational mode

827
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:20,490
because yeah once we start enforcing the

828
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,720
policy the battle is lost you

829
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,240
phone call will not be picked up your

830
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,250
phone will automatically reject it so we

831
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,868
started in an observational mode which

832
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,869
has its own problems you know

833
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:34,970
can you be in a relatively safe state

834
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:37,380
for a while while you observe violations

835
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,669
the only true answer to this is what I

836
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,960
was telling you earlier which is you

837
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,000
have to have machine learning sitting

838
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,640
there and gathering what you're doing

839
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,440
and even then in any learning paradigm

840
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,790
you're initially operating in a safe

841
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,790
state because if I started with a

842
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,690
default policy that was enforced you

843
00:38:50,790 --> 00:39:06,509
want to know what the user was doing

844
00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:07,920
anyway so it's a good problem but I have

845
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,230
a quick question about that learning

846
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,970
state yes any thoughts on how long you'd

847
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,920
let it run before you decide you have

848
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:17,368
enough information good question that's

849
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,260
what we're playing with right now so you

850
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,970
have this trade-off where you might want

851
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,950
to say I'll let it run for like a month

852
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,350
and capture all possible nuances and

853
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,180
then get the user to fix the policy but

854
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:29,160
then you run into do you really want it

855
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,470
to be you know let loose for a month

856
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,930
without any protection and so what we

857
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,750
are looking at is sort of saying right

858
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:41,660
now doing a daily update but that's an

859
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:43,950
interesting human factors issue you know

860
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,629
you could do this every 10 minutes and

861
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,009
say boss I just notice every time you

862
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,300
notice a violation you could go right up

863
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,650
and say boss I just noticed a violation

864
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,170
of your policies do you want to fix it

865
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,430
we suspect that people will not be too

866
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,510
happy with something like that

867
00:39:53,430 --> 00:40:00,589
so we've arbitrarily picked a day but

868
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,590
there's nothing sacrosanct about it

869
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,920
so for the system stipes yes sir

870
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:20,890
what about another phase where you do

871
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,230
intercept like the phone call but then

872
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,299
you tell the user about it like later

873
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,579
that night say hey we intercepted your

874
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,589
phone call and we told your mom that

875
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:33,119
you're you know somewhere in Lafayette

876
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:36,400
is this what you wanted us to have done

877
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:40,960
so that's a good thought and we we sort

878
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:44,500
of discussed it the issue is that if

879
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,320
your issue is how close are you to the

880
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,630
correct policy when you start right if

881
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,550
you are reasonably close to the correct

882
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,500
policy then there will be a small number

883
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,440
of violations that you can periodically

884
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,880
report if you follow the approach you've

885
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,740
outlined which is something we discussed

886
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,859
you will have to report every action and

887
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,270
say was this the correct action I picked

888
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,560
up the phone here was that correct I

889
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:09,369
didn't pick up the phone there was that

890
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,839
correct right and so you and if it turns

891
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,329
out that the policies are reasonably

892
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:15,430
close and 80 90 percent of the actions

893
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,780
are going to be correct anyway then that

894
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,029
you're just blowing up the amount of

895
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,160
feedback you're giving to the user if

896
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,020
you have no clue on whether your policy

897
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,049
is correct or not or you want to be in a

898
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,280
highly defensive mode then you can do

899
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,470
something like that say I'm going to run

900
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,760
the policy and report to you all actions

901
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:34,029
and say whether they were intended or

902
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,920
not yes sir yeah I sort of Mountain so

903
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,520
you do your observational period and

904
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,960
then you do this probationary period or

905
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,180
something and then you go into full

906
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,859
enforcement I guess it was kind of what

907
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,149
I was doing so that's that's a that's a

908
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,980
good thought that's a good thought that

909
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,240
frankly I hadn't thought of which is

910
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,859
that you start with some pure

911
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,390
observation things that when you're

912
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:54,400
reasonably certain that you're right you

913
00:41:52,390 --> 00:42:00,069
sort of say a camera enforce the policy

914
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:03,490
and report essentially flip a switch and

915
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:05,529
go from observing actions that occur to

916
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:10,299
reporting actions that don't occur which

917
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:17,619
hopefully would then be phew good point

918
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:20,200
so this is some reason doesn't like grad

919
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,510
student animations

920
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:28,629
you can go crazy with PowerPoint like we

921
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:32,080
have here so what I'm trying to show you

922
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,970
here is so I I hand waved and said yes

923
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,080
we can run this on a mobile device and

924
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,930
the answer is yes we can but that still

925
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,910
doesn't mean that you say who cares you

926
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:45,759
know this is this is a Snapdragon

927
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:50,589
octa-core CPU all because there's still

928
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,540
battery to be thought off right so what

929
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,610
we do is instead of reasoning on

930
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,950
everything statically one of the things

931
00:42:54,610 --> 00:43:03,220
that the general reason it lets you do

932
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:05,439
is to say free reason over certain

933
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,640
things and find all inferences and store

934
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,700
them in a way that you can just later

935
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,410
use them right so if you think about the

936
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,669
context that I was describing on which

937
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,440
you're going to reason over a policy

938
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,560
parts of those contexts are static your

939
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,140
name is not changing if you join a

940
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,600
faculty position somewhere you're there

941
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,089
for at least six years and once you get

942
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,600
tenure you're likely there for a long

943
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,070
time I can extend that to PhD students

944
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,049
right once you become a PhD student

945
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:37,470
you're likely there for five I mean so

946
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:40,660
some of these things are slowly changing

947
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,520
so what you can do is you can take of

948
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,839
calling them static facts but I should

949
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,509
really be calling them very slowly

950
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,370
changing things you can take those stuff

951
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,680
and the basic ontology domain ontology

952
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,450
is you have and build an inference model

953
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,069
and save it so that you can later just

954
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,620
you don't have to do that part of

955
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,390
inference right if you are an assistant

956
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,770
professor I can infer ahead of time that

957
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,210
you're a faculty and store that I don't

958
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,210
have to do that influence every time

959
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:18,249
and then you get just the dynamic part

960
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:23,079
and the context information and this

961
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:26,019
I've put here because the system

962
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,779
policies can change but if you are

963
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,828
reasonably sure if if you know Perdue is

964
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:31,749
a hundred something year old institution

965
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:33,939
it came up with a policy 100 years ago

966
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:37,269
and it's not changing you could move

967
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:40,449
this to the part of the influencer model

968
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:42,839
that you pre-compute I don't know why

969
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,839
it's not moving

970
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,090
and the user-defined rules come in after

971
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,210
social system defined rules for very

972
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:59,310
obvious reasons okay so how are we doing

973
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:04,920
on time five twenty is when I have to

974
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:07,830
finish because I have thirty more slides

975
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,620
but so I will skip through the thirty

976
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:14,310
more slides I tell you this once you buy

977
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:17,640
into this idea that complex context and

978
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:20,040
policies defined over that context makes

979
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,290
sense for security and access control

980
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,700
you can see other places where the

981
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,740
supply so I showed you this in the

982
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:30,390
mobile domain but let me show you a

983
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:37,859
different domain and I'll skip a lot of

984
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:38,819
the slides now so if you're if you're if

985
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:46,380
you're from India here you will

986
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:48,180
recognize some of the things but you

987
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,920
know the one of the metaphors that

988
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:54,299
people are being for I knew I was going

989
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,040
to skip those slides otherwise I would

990
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,720
have changed them to well if the state

991
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,090
of Indiana I would have said if you're

992
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,779
guarding the basket you're facing the

993
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,420
player that's what you have to do not

994
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,650
guarding the basket by you know Caleb

995
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,240
Johnson or whoever is the big guy right

996
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,530
now should not just stand with us back

997
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,919
to the players of the basket rain you

998
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,540
have to observe so what is happening

999
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,540
right now if you look at the state of

1000
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,580
the art and intrusion defense is a lot

1001
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,790
of low level sensors and a lot of flat

1002
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:28,319
screens that show various warnings from

1003
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:30,300
the sense data and then this Superman

1004
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:34,070
superwoman whatever you want to call

1005
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,110
analysts sitting there whose job is to

1006
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,000
make sense of all of this in their head

1007
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:45,500
and what are they doing their reasoning

1008
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,500
over context and organizational policies

1009
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,760
this has completely stopped

1010
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:05,390
so I skipped a lot of the details but

1011
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,490
what we do is we say okay we'll do the

1012
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,799
sensor work like everyone else we get

1013
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:14,390
Wireshark data and hostplus monitoring

1014
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:16,010
data and ideas data and IPS data but

1015
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,779
here's something else we do because

1016
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,460
people in our group some people who

1017
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,310
might colleagues are experts in text

1018
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:25,099
analytics we actually trawl the web to

1019
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:27,230
say who's discussing a new attack that's

1020
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:29,720
another part of the context so now think

1021
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:31,730
about this what you really want the

1022
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,069
computer to do automatically instead of

1023
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:38,180
a single superhuman analyst is the

1024
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:41,330
following someone was describing a new

1025
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,950
vulnerability they have found in let's

1026
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,480
just pick Acrobat because this was an

1027
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:47,899
attack that was actually done

1028
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,700
successfully against the u.s. someone

1029
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:52,690
has found a new vulnerability in Acrobat

1030
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:57,230
and it has to do with malformed JPEGs

1031
00:47:52,690 --> 00:48:00,619
and I noticed that Acrobat is installed

1032
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:03,109
on my machine system scan and a process

1033
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:06,670
corresponding to that program is

1034
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:09,470
currently running host process scan and

1035
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:10,599
that process has opened an outbound

1036
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,069
connection

1037
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:16,250
why should Acrobat be mating in our bind

1038
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:20,359
connection has opened an outbound

1039
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:23,780
connection and it is to the DHCP zone of

1040
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:28,160
my local BSEP address space of my local

1041
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,359
internet provider now com sign security

1042
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,649
types are putting these facts together

1043
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,049
and their head and say this is not right

1044
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,390
this should not be happening that's what

1045
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:37,810
a good analyst does but notice what the

1046
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:40,040
analyst just did they reasoned over a

1047
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:41,390
bunch of contextual information I

1048
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,810
haven't shown you policies yet

1049
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:47,740
so let me add policies one of the very

1050
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,740
well-known attacks

1051
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,230
this was something that Lockheed Martin

1052
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,460
followed for almost two years from a

1053
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:03,599
nation-state actor that shall remain

1054
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:07,960
unnamed which you can guess which one

1055
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:10,480
two years where they started and for two

1056
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,940
years they were constantly sending in

1057
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,579
new malware with new vulnerabilities

1058
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:21,670
that have been discovered how did this

1059
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:25,119
start this started because five of their

1060
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:27,869
scientists in the missile division who

1061
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,970
are each individually brilliant you know

1062
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:33,550
aeronautical astronautical engineers got

1063
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:36,339
an email from their professions it's

1064
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:39,250
like you know Chris and Mike and Alisa

1065
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:41,380
and everyone simultaneously getting mail

1066
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,740
from ACM saying you've been nominated

1067
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,910
for the Turing award this year now any

1068
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,220
one of them might be individually

1069
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,899
deserving of that honor but all five

1070
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,640
faculty in the same area in the same

1071
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,300
department all being nominated for the

1072
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,180
Turing award if I'm dan trinka I'm

1073
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,500
thinking this is not right dan knows

1074
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,910
enough about our department that you

1075
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:06,010
know he can peak and figure that out so

1076
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,149
this is a policy issue in a context

1077
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,619
issue here's another version of the

1078
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,170
policy issue this was a targeted attack

1079
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:18,250
on defense establishment in India what a

1080
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:22,900
year and half ago people got email about

1081
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,970
a travel that they had just done so you

1082
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,650
know after this Chris my sent me an

1083
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,720
email saying send me all your bills or

1084
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,900
whatever for the travel right they got

1085
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,180
an email that said about apropos the

1086
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,069
latest trip you took to some reasonable

1087
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,540
place where they were normally going

1088
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:41,680
here is the bill or the something

1089
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,540
organizational policy says that this

1090
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,980
travel is handled by the travel

1091
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,650
department it should never be going to

1092
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:50,740
the individual users so here's the

1093
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:52,390
reason we're policies and contexts it

1094
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,709
has to be dynamically reasoned over to

1095
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,910
figure out that something bad is

1096
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,349
happening and I'll give you the final

1097
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,348
example since I'm almost out of time

1098
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,810
so what we're doing is the thing was I

1099
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,210
was describing capturing organizational

1100
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,980
policies and the observed say to the

1101
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:16,170
system and the context and I we skip all

1102
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:17,760
this good stuff so you've heard of the

1103
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:23,610
latest things about cars being hacked

1104
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,960
and things like that right so we're

1105
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,640
actually building we're working with

1106
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,490
some of our computer engineers to put in

1107
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,700
hardware we monitor the obd data we have

1108
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,979
we have our own sensors but even if you

1109
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:39,689
ignore all this right and you just rely

1110
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:42,720
on data on the canvas it's not that hard

1111
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:47,060
to write policies for the car that say

1112
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:50,580
if the car is allegedly traveling at an

1113
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:54,360
increasing speed while at the same time

1114
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:58,640
the RPM is decreasing and the door is

1115
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:02,550
shown open this is not right

1116
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:05,339
right so we add to this external

1117
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,590
conceptual thing so there are sensors we

1118
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,660
put in the problem with the problem

1119
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:12,540
we're doing this in a car is how do you

1120
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:14,220
trust that data so in a in a cyber

1121
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,990
security system in a mobile device there

1122
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,490
are at least some sources of data that

1123
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:20,399
you can trust even if other those

1124
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,040
sources are fudging in a car if someone

1125
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,900
has compromised the can bus they can

1126
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,670
compromise all the data on the canvas

1127
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,640
it's just it was a very poorly designed

1128
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,680
system so we're saying can we add

1129
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,509
sensors and just because just if in case

1130
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,520
you think this is a car problem the car

1131
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:40,350
industry will fix it the same bus is

1132
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:41,759
used in all the Navy ships canvas it's

1133
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:45,000
used for the Navy ships we're working

1134
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,460
with onr and us na right now to see if

1135
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,440
some of this work can be applied to

1136
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,600
ships and someone or someone who knows

1137
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,400
these things I don't showed me that the

1138
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,020
planes in the airforce don't have the

1139
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,250
can bus but they have a bus that is very

1140
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,800
similar design was designed to

1141
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,330
efficiently funnel packets with minimal

1142
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,430
response time between the control

1143
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,410
service in the actuators and there was

1144
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:08,040
no thought of some of those package

1145
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:12,120
might actually be bad so again right if

1146
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:14,360
you can if you buy into this philosophy

1147
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,490
what we are trying to say is

1148
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,620
by observing the context and having

1149
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,970
policies that talk about the context in

1150
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,069
the sense of what is permitted and what

1151
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:24,919
is prohibited you can actually do a

1152
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,600
better job of security than just the

1153
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,910
straight traditional access control

1154
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:42,620
models that work so I'm out of time I'll

1155
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:45,770
stop here thank you very much yes

1156
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,779
so the accelerometer stuff in this r2

1157
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:50,180
implement for the policies on top of the

1158
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,370
existing policies which are there so

1159
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,740
that like if in cases that's let us stop

1160
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:56,660
moving then don't stop the car so that

1161
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,430
that detects a hacker attack or

1162
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,549
something in that correct okay so what

1163
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:05,600
what we are saying is can we we've tried

1164
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:07,640
to do this purely on the canvas sense

1165
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,850
data and we can write so we can build

1166
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,310
this paper is currently just going out

1167
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:18,890
for review yeah so hopefully it will be

1168
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:20,690
shortly shareable but we can even using

1169
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:24,319
relatively elementary techniques like in

1170
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:26,180
Markov models detect these kinds of

1171
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,420
contextual fluxes that represent an

1172
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,730
attack but there we are we're assuming

1173
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,620
that the adversary is changing some data

1174
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:36,410
but not completely thinking through the

1175
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,480
model and changing other data so not you

1176
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,220
know so we can say if your system is

1177
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,720
showing the break is press while the car

1178
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,189
is accelerating you know you're getting

1179
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,379
wrong in the break but if I'm in

1180
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,420
adversity I can I will press show that

1181
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,590
the brake is pressed and show that the

1182
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,620
car is slowing down even though it's

1183
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:54,050
physically not so we are adding a few

1184
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,450
minimal extra sensors where we have the

1185
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:58,790
ground truth we control those sensors so

1186
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:00,830
we can something inside you know more

1187
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:03,460
sophisticated adversity is is trying to

1188
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,460
do something bad

1189
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,240
right now they are passive but there's

1190
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:13,359
no reason why they can't be crypto so

1191
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,098
one of my colleagues has just proposed

1192
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,869
he's it's gone to Auckland I don't have

1193
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:22,180
to make it his Auckland is really tough

1194
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:26,000
to get into but he is proposed adding

1195
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:29,180
lightweight hashed Mac's to the messages

1196
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,650
- but again that's the worst engineering

1197
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:36,140
the camera in the current canvas will

1198
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:37,869
not an MB the full weight of the car

1199
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,670
industry is to say there is no problem

1200
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:42,470
and if there is a problem don't tell us

1201
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,789
to change the can bus you know just if

1202
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,439
you can do something on top of it that's

1203
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:47,630
good otherwise don't bother us because

1204
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,460
this is a huge investment right now in

1205
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:54,730
all these cars alright thank you very

1206
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,730
much
