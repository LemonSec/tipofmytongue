1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,300
hi everyone thank you for coming tonight

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:13,269
it is my pleasure to announce Dickie

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,890
George who comes to us from the applied

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:18,009
physics lab at Johns Hopkins University

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,079
and before that was several years as a

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,179
mathematician at the NSA it's going to

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,900
be talking to us about the role of the

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:27,598
NSA in the development of des i could

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,488
probably introduce myself as well I'm

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,570
Lauren Stewart I'm just the president of

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:36,370
the serious student association who is a

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,090
sponsor of this talk we're really glad

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,800
to have all of you here and without any

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:49,000
further ado I will let Dickie take it

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:50,530
away thank you very much I do have one

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,600
more thing to say if you have questions

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,149
he's perfectly willing to take them

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,350
during the talk we have this microphone

19
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,179
which I'll be walking around we have

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,929
this microphone back here so that your

21
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:04,089
questions can be recorded so that they

22
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,260
will be available for all posterity so

23
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,150
keep that in mind when you're asking

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,440
questions okay yeah it's important to

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:13,150
being recorded I think that's a good

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:19,000
thing so for me the sounds loud to me is

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:24,630
this tool out is that ok ok so for me

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,610
this uh this talk started back in 2010 I

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:32,500
was talking to a gentleman from RSA at

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,690
2010 he was saying next year's RSA

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,780
conference is the 20th anniversary be

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,679
nice if we had something big now

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,780
coincidentally i was planning to retire

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,250
in 2011 and so I used that as an excuse

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,030
to talk to the director and say we ought

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,320
to declassify the whole des story and he

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,680
said that's that's a good idea we ought

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,809
to now the reason I wanted to do was des

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,640
was back in 72 it turns out that I was

40
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,770
the last person at NSA who has played

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,920
any role in that who had participated in

42
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,690
the evaluation and I knew if I retired

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,930
before was Declassified it was never

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,989
going to get out because it was it was a

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,850
pretty quiet story all through its life

46
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,190
so this gave me an opportunity to do

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,730
that that was kind of fun this is the

48
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,640
third time I've given the talk I gave it

49
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,109
RSA and I gave it once in a class but

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,599
this one's being recorded I think that's

51
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,060
really nice it's nice to have this for

52
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,429
history so please do ask questions now

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,870
I'll also tell you that when i when i

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,580
did this talk at RSA i did it on a when

55
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,190
wednesday or thursday but during the

56
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,720
keynotes the tuesday keynotes they had a

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,489
panel a 45-minute panel on this story

58
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,109
where it was just question and answers

59
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,540
the panel i was on the panel and there

60
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,780
were four public cryptographers who were

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,940
asking questions that that tape is still

62
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,340
available on youtube if you want to see

63
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,690
it it's pretty interesting the for

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,959
public guys probably people you know

65
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:04,190
that was a whit dippy in Marty Hellman

66
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:07,700
adi shamir and ron rivest so they were

67
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:11,359
guys who had been involved in in the

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,119
game and they were friends man it was a

69
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,950
it was a fun panel the the unfun part of

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,420
it was when they announced it as soon as

71
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,339
they now still all forums started

72
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,988
sending me the questions on emails

73
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,849
hoping i would answer them before the

74
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,590
panel i had to keep telling i'm not

75
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,690
going to answer the questions before we

76
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,250
do it live you know so it's got to be

77
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,880
spontaneous I can't be giving you guys

78
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,500
all the answers up front so it of course

79
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,609
Holman said that but I've been waiting

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:43,430
30 years and I may die before this panel

81
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:45,019
yeah but it was fun so now let me sit

82
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,989
stage a little bit for what's going on

83
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,239
back in the 70s for a lot of you the

84
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,609
world was different back then you're not

85
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,410
not familiar the story at all in 1972

86
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,180
crypto was not a commercial thing there

87
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,400
were a few companies mostly European

88
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,660
that we're doing things not well they

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,079
basically do the same thing they've been

90
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,879
doing in World War two the real crypto

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,810
is being done by governments around the

92
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,548
world and nobody else got to play so

93
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,980
that was the state of the art at the

94
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,380
same time if you look at the what was

95
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,430
going on in the world I worked in the

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,409
information assurance Directorate at NSA

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,370
by the way of a few years was 41 so it

98
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,370
was really a few years

99
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,580
at that point in time the information

100
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,799
assurance director which had about 2500

101
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,940
people that were doing this evaluation

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,900
of crypto and implementation of crypto

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,400
that director did not own a computer we

104
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:54,039
were doing the work with with paper and

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:56,409
pencil and then you know about 72 73 we

106
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,030
got a line over to another building

107
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,070
where we could borrow some time on

108
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,159
another part of the agency's computer

109
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,280
and so you could read your cards in and

110
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,960
you got to run a program a day and of

111
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,000
course there were about seven cards up

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,169
front that were control cards and if you

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,450
got any one of those wrong you didn't

114
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,310
get to run anything that day that was

115
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,370
the way it went so it was a very much

116
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,820
different world in about nineteen

117
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,760
seventy-two someone decided that the

118
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:29,290
Commerce is going to it's going to be

119
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,760
using computers we need to have some

120
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:36,220
kind of encryption to protect that

121
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:38,440
information now at the same time I was

122
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,600
sitting in my desk in 1973 when the

123
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,669
director of information assurance at NSA

124
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,520
walked by my desk and said what are you

125
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,950
working on I said I'm working on a

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,900
computer cryptographic algorithm he said

127
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,870
what I said well it's it's going to be

128
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,340
an encryption algorithm that's designed

129
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,900
to run in software he said okay don't

130
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,909
spend more than ten percent of your time

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,719
on that because we will never run crypto

132
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,390
and software you can't trust computers

133
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:13,390
and that was that was the world back

134
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:14,770
then so when they told NBS national

135
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,729
bureau of standards which is now NIST

136
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:22,240
that we need an algorithm for commercial

137
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:24,669
use to protect the information the first

138
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,030
thing they did was come to NSA and say

139
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,859
would you design us an algorithm there

140
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,960
was a lot of discussion a lot of

141
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:39,749
discussion at all levels at NSA at my

142
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,828
level I was that was 72 I was younger

143
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,079
the lot of the discussion was

144
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:47,259
technically could we do it and how would

145
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,449
we do it at the more senior levels the

146
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,789
questions were if we put down an

147
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,599
algorithm at no one's going to use it

148
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,498
because they think it's going to be

149
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,329
hooked if anybody finds an attack on it

150
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:01,809
they're going to know we hoped it even

151
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,159
even if we didn't so this politically is

152
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:07,959
going to be a disaster force no matter

153
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:11,529
what way we go if you think about the

154
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,569
world of crypto back then we designed

155
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,989
things like like Vincent Vincent a

156
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,999
handheld radio that a for observer uses

157
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:23,258
it's got an algorithm in it the

158
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:28,209
algorithm was designed in 1957 we

159
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,969
evaluated it for 12 years to ensure that

160
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:32,739
there was nothing that could go wrong

161
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:34,839
then we implemented it and we looked at

162
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:38,078
that implementation when I said we

163
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,059
looked at that implementation I spent

164
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,089
six months with the engineering diagrams

165
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:47,110
for that thing failing every resistor

166
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:49,149
every gate every register stage every

167
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,839
breaking every line to see what could go

168
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,969
wrong in anything serious that went

169
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:59,019
wrong we put an alarm in so that it

170
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:01,509
would be caught if it happened so well

171
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:05,739
we actually fielded that in 1976 so took

172
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:08,949
19 years from design to fielding it's

173
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:11,018
still out in the field so it's been 40

174
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:15,579
years it's never headed anything changed

175
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,049
has never had a problem unlike an

176
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:21,429
operating system which changes every

177
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:23,919
Tuesday so it was a different world but

178
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:25,808
that 12 years of evaluation of the logic

179
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,558
we relied on that to make sure we

180
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:31,269
weren't missing anything and Wendy I

181
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:35,050
said we're going to we're going to put

182
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:37,419
this out in a year we were nervous that

183
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:41,919
that we would design something and there

184
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,110
would be a problem with it so the agency

185
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,819
said we don't want to we don't want to

186
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,800
design the algorithm now when we said we

187
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:50,259
don't want to design the algorithm there

188
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,189
were big equities concerns and equities

189
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:56,860
are balancing the offense in the deep

190
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,600
so everybody thinks cripta verbal sighs

191
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,200
when you think of equity concerned that

192
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,810
wasn't it because the offense wanted a

193
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,110
16-bit variable and nobody was going to

194
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,060
buy that right because I that's a joke

195
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,850
so that wasn't the concern what what the

196
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,579
offense really wanted was they wanted to

197
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:21,040
make sure that we weren't teaching the

198
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,209
world how to make good crypto they

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,620
weren't worried about us teaching the

200
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,880
Russians how to make good crypto they

201
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,540
were worried if I was teaching the world

202
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,910
how to make good crypto that was the big

203
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,620
concern in that well that was you know

204
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,520
if you fast-forward to skipjack days

205
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,830
that that's where we that that rose

206
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:45,010
again from the dead that said same

207
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:48,700
concern so it was decided that we would

208
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:51,700
not design the algorithm but the

209
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,459
director told the director of NIST with

210
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,149
MBS the time told them that yes we will

211
00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:02,229
evaluate the algorithm that is proposed

212
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:04,630
to make sure that there's not anything

213
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,890
there as far as we can tell again it was

214
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,360
one going to be a one-year evaluation

215
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,160
but we will evaluate it to make sure

216
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,000
that there's no weakness there and we'll

217
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,800
tell you if we find anything and the

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,510
director of NSA said I want to be able

219
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,300
to assure the director of missed that

220
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,120
the algorithm is as strong as advertised

221
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,130
that there aren't shortcut attacks that

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,029
we find so if we find anything we are

223
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,350
going to tell them so those the ground

224
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:40,149
rules were playing under at that point

225
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:41,649
in time now mr. put out a call for what

226
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,300
one of these algorithms the algorithm

227
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:48,329
could be used as a data encryption

228
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:51,160
standard and they got three submissions

229
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:56,529
all were from professors that wanted a

230
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:59,439
lot of money to study the problem and of

231
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,760
course the directors and bs said that's

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,160
not really what I'm looking for i'm

233
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,290
looking for an algorithm and so we

234
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,069
looked around and looked around came

235
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,890
back to NSA

236
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,970
and said can't get one can you design

237
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,790
one so we went through the same

238
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,980
discussion again will we do it what's it

239
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,719
going to look like there were a lot of

240
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,900
discussions inside about what it should

241
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,850
look like and as we were in the middle

242
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,829
of those discussions someone found out

243
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,870
that IBM was working on an algorithm

244
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,440
that they were planned at planning to

245
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,770
commercialize it's called Lucifer it was

246
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,560
going to go out and the the main

247
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,970
designer of that algorithm was it was a

248
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,010
gentleman who had worked in the Army

249
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,430
Security Agency and it worked on Krypto

250
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,260
with NSA so there was a feeling that he

251
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,349
actually knew what he was doing and this

252
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,700
might be a decent algorithm they went

253
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,680
they went to IBM and talked to them in

254
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,680
IBM agreed to give up their commercial

255
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,199
plans to donate the algorithm to the

256
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,239
government for non national security use

257
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,840
and they would put it into the

258
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,080
competition so NBS put out another call

259
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,600
and they got three more applicants one

260
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,360
another professor who asked for a lot of

261
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,740
money to study the problem they got a

262
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,660
company that said they would allow NBS

263
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,610
to use their algorithm but they wanted

264
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,410
to remain proprietary so no one would

265
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:31,000
know what it looked like and they wanted

266
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:33,040
to charge for use NBS said that's not

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,200
really what we had in mind when we were

268
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,150
looking for a data encryption standard

269
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,560
it really has to be visible to the

270
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:45,459
public so that the public can evaluate

271
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:48,819
it and the third was Lucifer so Lucifer

272
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,530
went in and they talked to the director

273
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,660
once again he set up similar ground

274
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:57,040
rules he said ok we are going to

275
00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:00,339
evaluate this we're going to look at it

276
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,310
see if there's any attack that's short

277
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,660
of exhaustion we're going to tell you if

278
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,199
we have if it doesn't meet its

279
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,439
advertised strength and we won't make

280
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,350
any will make we want to or suggest any

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,470
changes unless they are critical to the

282
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,900
security so if we find an attack will

283
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,080
tell you will tell IBM

284
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:26,020
and we'll work with them to fix it if we

285
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:31,090
don't find an attack we won't make any

286
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,550
changes it sounds pretty fair and then

287
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,790
they set up the most convoluted

288
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:40,000
evaluation system you can imagine they

289
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,770
set up one small team of people to work

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,970
with IBM to give them any information

291
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,540
they might ask and they were told any

292
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,130
question that IBM asks you answer it ok

293
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,750
so you've got to be completely honest

294
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,730
with them and they they cleared the

295
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,530
people at IBM so they could get that

296
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,620
information if it needed to be

297
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:03,579
classified they set up a team of people

298
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:08,080
to evaluate the the algorithm a smallish

299
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:12,070
team and everyone knew that those teams

300
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,300
existed that the evaluation team and the

301
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,510
team that worked with IBM shortly after

302
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,290
that they set up a shadow evaluation

303
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,450
team to do an evaluation it was team

304
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,640
that nobody knew about I was on the

305
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,910
shadow I was actually on the first team

306
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,870
as a bit player but I was on the shadow

307
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:38,560
team as you know make sure we really

308
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,150
don't miss anything it's funny when I

309
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,920
was getting ready to give this talk I

310
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:46,930
was up talking to my best friend at NSA

311
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,290
who I've worked with virtually every day

312
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,689
for 35 years until he retired really

313
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,699
worked with them closely every day and I

314
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,320
was talking about giving this talking in

315
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,320
he said oh do you want my notes

316
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,140
he said do you want my notes and I said

317
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,840
your notes you never worked on des he

318
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,500
said oh yeah i was on the Chado team

319
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,640
that was watching your team you just

320
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,610
didn't know there was another team that

321
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,050
existed I don't know how many shadow

322
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,900
teams that were watching those other

323
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,349
things but it seems like everybody was

324
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:30,650
involved and nobody knew it so it was a

325
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:34,200
crazy system but when we worked with IBM

326
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,910
we gave them everybody knows what des

327
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,520
looks like it's got a its got a bit

328
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,400
permutations got s boxes the s-boxes our

329
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,290
little ejs box has for permutations of

330
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:51,230
the numbers from 0 to 15 so we gave them

331
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:54,000
eight criteria to generate those s boxes

332
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,510
there was a ninth criteria that IBM

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,120
didn't know about and that was the that

334
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,490
was the criteria to block differential

335
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,779
cryptanalytic attacks because

336
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:09,930
differential cryptanalysis was

337
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:13,020
classified at the time so what we said

338
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,329
was generate a bunch of s boxes and then

339
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,839
we'll help you pick the set of now what

340
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,790
our plan was was to see which of these

341
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,960
thousand permutations they submitted

342
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:27,449
satisfied that ninth criteria and we

343
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,520
just say let's use these it seems pretty

344
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,890
reasonable the problem is that ninth

345
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,740
criteria was really really tricky it was

346
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,390
any single bid in has to guess to go to

347
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,280
at least two bits out at least one of

348
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,020
those bits has to be on the outside so

349
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,760
because the outside bits get spread over

350
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,530
and have more influence in blah blah

351
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:50,730
blah blah blah and asking that to happen

352
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,020
for every single one bit off put too

353
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,000
much restriction on those little

354
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,280
permutations little permutations are

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,480
funny anyway if you show anybody a

356
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,060
little permutation he's going to find

357
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,040
all sorts of things that look non-random

358
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:07,139
because the human eye just does that so

359
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:12,420
we took all of the permutations that IBM

360
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,169
had given us and couldn't find a that

361
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:20,399
mat that met

362
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:23,220
ninth criteria so the the team that was

363
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:27,118
working with IBM generated permutations

364
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:32,369
that met all nine criteria gave them

365
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:34,019
back to IBM and said let's use these we

366
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,459
didn't know if IBM would notice that

367
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,769
those were not permutations that they've

368
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,090
given us or not because they gave us

369
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,909
lots and lots of these little

370
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:46,699
permutations could have could have been

371
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:50,820
a set from that but someone did and

372
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,159
someone actually said that we you know

373
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,840
we got these permutations back from NSA

374
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:57,330
and they were all changed we don't know

375
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,470
what happened well when they announced

376
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,869
that the world immediately assumed

377
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,850
that's where the hook was and as they

378
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:08,309
had planted a hook in that permutation

379
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,189
now when I say the world it wasn't

380
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,499
everybody adi shamir told me that he

381
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,090
never believed we hoped it because he

382
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:17,369
knew we wanted to read Russian you meant

383
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,629
Russian mail and the Russians weren't

384
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:23,178
going to use it so why would we bother

385
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:25,469
to Hogan and in some sense that's true

386
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:26,970
I've got a lot of stories about funny

387
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,600
things that happened with Audi we had

388
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,450
some good times over theirs but this was

389
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,209
this was not a bad thing from an NSA

390
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,200
point of view because there was no hook

391
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:43,739
in those s boxes they were they were

392
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,509
there to block that attack and it was

393
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:50,009
much better for us in two ways to have

394
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,200
people think that that's where the hook

395
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,929
was because it meant the only people who

396
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,879
were probably going to use it were the

397
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,159
commercial people in the US were being

398
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:03,449
going to be forced to use it the world

399
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:07,340
wasn't going to use it second it was

400
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:11,999
much better for us to have people

401
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,070
looking at those permutations trying to

402
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,080
figure out what the trapdoor is rather

403
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,480
than figuring out why we used those to

404
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,699
make it stronger much better from them

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,919
to try to attack them than to think what

406
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,480
were they doing so that worked out

407
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,610
pretty well now

408
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,290
one of the questions that Marty asked

409
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,770
was why didn't you change the key

410
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,510
schedule key schedules way to a simple

411
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,320
he said I spent months on that key

412
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,960
schedule and my answer was yeah I spent

413
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,450
years on that key schedule you spent

414
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,340
months if I had been able to find

415
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,559
anything wrong so that looked to me like

416
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,070
it was way week it looked like it was

417
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,730
way too simple if I could have found the

418
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,470
hint of an attack I could have fixed it

419
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,270
but the ground rule said that if we

420
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,620
couldn't find an attack we couldn't

421
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:04,059
change anything so i think was took minh

422
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,500
said you know when it came back they

423
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,460
hadn't changed the wire they hadn't

424
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,020
changed the line they hadn't changed

425
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,669
anything and that's really true we

426
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,440
hadn't changed any wires we hadn't

427
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,179
changed the permutation we hadn't

428
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,160
changed the key schedule we hadn't done

429
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:19,600
anything all we did was the what's the S

430
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,980
boxes now the other the other big issue

431
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:27,178
of course was 56 bits of crypto verbal

432
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:31,720
that was an information assurance equity

433
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,610
so back in the 50s we were trying with

434
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,080
one of the things that they did when

435
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,850
they set up NSA was it said we don't

436
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,090
want to be caught in the situation that

437
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,820
the Germans were caught in World War two

438
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,409
where they knew there was an attack on

439
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,360
enigma but they didn't think that

440
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,559
anybody would spend the money to build

441
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:54,100
anything to exploit it we don't want to

442
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,290
fall prey to that and so Jim Fraser

443
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,620
developed something that was akin to

444
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:02,049
Moore's law to predict where technology

445
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,909
was going to go in the future he did a

446
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:07,570
little bit at a finer granularity

447
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:11,290
because different technologies evolve at

448
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,809
different rates so so there were things

449
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,879
that were happening like tape readers we

450
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,290
used to use well you could predict what

451
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,790
was going to happen with tape reader

452
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,540
technology that was it that was a big

453
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:25,200
cost for us it could get better but it

454
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,820
wasn't going to get better forever and

455
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,679
so the improvement was going to want to

456
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:36,320
tail off you were only going to get so

457
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:38,640
much better things like that so we had

458
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,020
something we had standards that would

459
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,790
tell us how good things had to be and we

460
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,440
knew what we were requiring of

461
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,330
communication systems that the

462
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,820
government was using now remember when

463
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:54,060
we did Vincent we evaluated that

464
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,520
algorithm for 12 years and then we

465
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,850
evaluated the implementation for another

466
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,530
7 the implementation is so critical

467
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,300
because that's what you're usually

468
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,320
attacking you're usually attacking an

469
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,360
implementation not not the not the

470
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,070
algorithm itself it's pretty easy to

471
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,360
find the problem with the algorithm it's

472
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,370
really hard to find a problem with the

473
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,530
implementation because implementations

474
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,709
change I'm ever one time when we were

475
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:24,720
looking at that at that handheld thing

476
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:28,070
and we had we had end end clocks of

477
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,080
delay built-in built-in in one place and

478
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:35,129
when we went to test it we got n plus 1

479
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,260
and we're thinking what the heck how

480
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,250
does that happen well it happens because

481
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,930
the blasted wire was too long it slowed

482
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,380
down the signal enough that we did it

483
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,570
built in another delay bed for us and so

484
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,750
we had changed the whole design because

485
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,010
that that was the first implementation

486
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,720
you had to build that any you were never

487
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,670
get another one that had that extra

488
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,260
delay bit as times were going to change

489
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,360
those are the kind of things you need to

490
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,550
worry about another thing another

491
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,310
interesting that happened we had to we

492
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,290
had another line that was long well the

493
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,560
signal was was kind of dying out so we

494
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,180
had to put an amplifier on it the guy

495
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,100
who built it the company that built it

496
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,320
found they could buy amplifiers with

497
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,889
with an inverter cheaper than they could

498
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,570
buy amplifiers and so they used those so

499
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,010
suddenly we got an inverter in the

500
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,980
middle of our machine that we weren't

501
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:28,610
expecting you got to know about those

502
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,890
things and sometimes those things matter

503
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:34,290
like if you're adding a day plus B plus

504
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,750
C in an implementation you never add a

505
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,330
plus B plus C back in the old days you

506
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:43,170
add a to b then you take that some and

507
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:46,860
add it to see if you take a plus B plus

508
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,590
C it's different than if you take a plus

509
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,149
B plus C

510
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,699
when you go through and look at the

511
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,779
failure things that can happen it's a

512
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,490
different case and we had to throw a

513
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,559
whole series away one time because they

514
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,049
decided well that will just add b2c

515
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,418
first instead of it be first you can't

516
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:12,179
you can't make changes like that so the

517
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:14,970
implementation is so critical you got to

518
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:18,150
worry about that that's what we knew was

519
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:22,350
going to be attacked so when we were

520
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:24,539
looking at this algorithm we said if we

521
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,789
put a lot of crypto variable in here we

522
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,440
know what's going to happen the military

523
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,059
is going to say i can buy those des

524
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,419
boxes cheap i'm going to start using

525
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:38,250
those and we had no idea what the

526
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,809
implementation was going to be so the

527
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,210
director of information assurance said

528
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,399
make that crypt of herbal small enough

529
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:48,870
that the military won't be allowed to

530
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:51,090
use it the director the director said I

531
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,699
got to make it secure I can't I can't be

532
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,490
playing around like that so I actually

533
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,440
found a meeting notes from a meeting

534
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,590
that there were only two people in two

535
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,909
people plus an exec because neither the

536
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,080
two were going to take notes on anything

537
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,740
they had to have somebody who recorded

538
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,600
what was going on but Jim Fraser and the

539
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,100
director got together and then the

540
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,240
director said how big do I have to make

541
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,879
it to be safe into the future and it's

542
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,470
remember this was early 70s and Jim

543
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:25,710
Fraser said to go out to 1990 you need

544
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,270
56 bits but then you've got a dick

545
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,429
you've got decertified at nineteen

546
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,940
ninety because because in 1991 it's

547
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:35,159
going to be it's going to be attackable

548
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:39,450
so the director called up the director

549
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,559
of NBS and said we want to go 56 bits

550
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,899
it's going to give you till nineteen

551
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,070
ninety director of NB I said we're only

552
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,209
going to use the yes for three or four

553
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:50,490
years and then we'll replace it with

554
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,169
next version sure that's fine he didn't

555
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,860
understand how hard it was going to be

556
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,490
changed that thing out so that's where

557
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,899
the 56 bits came from now there's

558
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,770
another thing to happen that's parity

559
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:04,199
bits

560
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,840
and parity bits came because of again if

561
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,150
an IAD thing see we were used to dealing

562
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,340
with military military guys are out in

563
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,430
the field into muddy it's raining it's

564
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,709
all sorts of crap in the way they put

565
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,290
crypto variables in they have a piece of

566
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,140
paper strip of paper that they pull

567
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,909
through a little machine a key reader

568
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,590
it's got a metal comb in the air that

569
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:30,360
picks up the holes in the paper tape

570
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:34,770
tells it what the variable is doesn't

571
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:38,580
always work real well fact I'm zit

572
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,470
doesn't work real well so they added

573
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,810
parody on the reason they added parody

574
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,630
on if you do that the machine will tell

575
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,040
you it didn't pass parody try again you

576
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,700
don't want to put the wrong crypto

577
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,440
verbal in if you if you put the wrong

578
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,330
crypt of air berlin encrypt a message

579
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,640
send it out you're going to get a note

580
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:00,510
back in in the clear saying hey I can't

581
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,100
understand you so you try again you send

582
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,350
the same message out with a slightly

583
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,560
different variable that's a very bad

584
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:10,230
situation we didn't want to fall prey to

585
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,790
that so we routinely added parity bits

586
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,120
to make sure that the thing had loaded

587
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,040
right now it's a little bit different

588
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,360
working in a bank than working out in

589
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,940
the field so we probably would have been

590
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,689
okay without it but that's that's where

591
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:31,800
those bits of parity came from it's just

592
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:35,880
tradition so at this point in time we

593
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:38,970
went out with a 56 bit version 56 bits

594
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,070
also happened to fall nicely inside the

595
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:45,450
range of what we knew differential

596
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:48,120
cryptanalysis could do because we were

597
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,880
looking at this and I had a path that

598
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,709
took it down to just about 56 and so I I

599
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,260
can tell the director I'm pretty happy

600
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,690
about this because it looks like you're

601
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,210
going to be able to say yes it meets its

602
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,190
advertised strength whereas if you made

603
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,180
it big yeah you're awfully familiar with

604
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,200
differential cryptanalysis a complicated

605
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,430
Crypt variable schedule wouldn't help

606
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,020
you much with differential cryptanalysis

607
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,940
what you're looking for some kind of

608
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,080
structure you usually do something like

609
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,910
say you know I'm going to assume a

610
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,610
little bit crypt of arable go in find it

611
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,740
find these kind

612
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,030
things and go back and look for the

613
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,400
structure at the end or you can start

614
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,629
with structure at the beginning go down

615
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,490
assume some variable down here back up

616
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,470
see if the structure exists so you're

617
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,240
not you're not making tons of variable

618
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,350
assumptions the complicated mixing

619
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,299
encrypted verbal wouldn't have helped

620
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:37,240
you a whole lot so at that point in time

621
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:40,090
it looked like everything was good we

622
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,130
had the world was sure that we had hook

623
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,379
the thing through the S boxes and so

624
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,600
there were papers coming out left and

625
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,390
right about so if some guys would even

626
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,909
say it's it's s box 6 that they hooked

627
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:55,900
here's how it works and you're thinking

628
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,460
really you know if you're going to tell

629
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,690
me this is where it is you got to talk

630
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,559
about the attackers don't just tell me

631
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,850
it's got to be this box and when I

632
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,190
looked at some of those s boxes they

633
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,719
really looked bad and we were pretty

634
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,150
happy that they looked that bad because

635
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,950
what a target that was for the world I

636
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:16,210
mean if the world is telling everybody

637
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,740
don't trust the thing that's great Marty

638
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,679
Hellman had it had a nice piece of work

639
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,309
on his memory trade-off time memory

640
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,110
trade-off I was great work it gave

641
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:31,918
people a lot of opportunity to do some

642
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:35,889
really neat things now that's the reason

643
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,870
that this was such a critical point in

644
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,590
the development of cryptography for the

645
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,070
world what made NSA the leader in

646
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,740
cryptography was we had the best

647
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:49,899
problems right we we had the best

648
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,580
designers in the world and we were

649
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,830
looking at their crypto and trying to

650
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,689
find problems with it nobody had those

651
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,870
kind of problems to work on that was

652
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,910
awesome we also had a critical mass of

653
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,189
people we had a thousand mathematicians

654
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,900
looking at these problems and sharing

655
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,860
the information with each other every

656
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:13,150
day so the best problems and a critical

657
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:18,928
mass of people thinking about it that's

658
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,929
how you own the space and we did on it

659
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:27,969
what we did with des was we gave the

660
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:31,620
world a problem to concentrate on and

661
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:35,920
then the internet popped up ARPANET and

662
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:40,090
that gave the world virtual critical

663
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,620
mass I remember I was I was having

664
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,389
dinner without his schmear one time and

665
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,580
we were I was talking about about his

666
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,559
work and he hauls out of slapped Isis

667
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,629
let me show you my emails from the 70s

668
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,430
and so we started going through his eat

669
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,290
he still had his emails from the 70s

670
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:57,880
when he had worked on this stuff it's in

671
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:59,710
there what was real emails because i

672
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,750
think the real email didn't start to

673
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,520
about 91 or something like that but but

674
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:07,320
it was notes that they were sending back

675
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:14,740
and forth so that so that was fun stuff

676
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:16,659
really fun stuff and then you know we

677
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,700
had differential analysis not because of

678
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,740
des we had it because of other

679
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,510
algorithms that have work done and then

680
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,590
we could apply it to DES you're never

681
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,170
going to find differential crypt

682
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:31,270
analysis by looking at des just doesn't

683
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:36,490
work so the the Japanese published an

684
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:38,590
algorithm called feel in the 80s and Adi

685
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,450
looked at that and he had this idea of

686
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:45,220
looking at differences to see what would

687
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:46,540
happen and he tracked it through and he

688
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,950
figured out what differential

689
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,460
cryptanalysis would do by looking at

690
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,260
feel he founded it just destroyed feel

691
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,630
so I said well I wondered what that

692
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:01,570
would do on des this should work on des

693
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:04,990
so he started looking at des and he kept

694
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:07,000
applying it in he just couldn't find a

695
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,570
good path through and it drove him nuts

696
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,760
he said these s boxes just don't let my

697
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:18,370
pants work and they all were coming

698
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,230
everything he tried would be 56 or worse

699
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:25,709
the best he could find was 56 and he

700
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,710
said you know

701
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:34,230
they changed the s-boxes I wonder so he

702
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:39,840
generated about 10 sets of random s

703
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,280
boxes and tried them in DES and he got

704
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,570
work factors on every one of them

705
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:48,210
between two to the 16th and 2 to the 32

706
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,740
so every random set that he tried his

707
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:55,140
differential cryptanalytic attack worked

708
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:58,770
really well so I remember the word came

709
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:03,180
out in 89 that shamir was going to

710
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:04,470
announce some des work didn't say he was

711
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,100
going to announce an attacks he's going

712
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:12,420
to announce some des work now I knew

713
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,649
what he had done on feel and so the

714
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,470
guess was it was differential

715
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:18,030
cryptanalytic all I was hoping was he

716
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:22,250
didn't find a better path than I had

717
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:25,230
because I was going to be screwed so

718
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:28,020
when his work came out that he had found

719
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,080
the best path that we had it was really

720
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:34,980
cool but in his paper when he talked

721
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,439
about this this path and he talked about

722
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,970
how it works so much better on every

723
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,210
other s box he presented him showed how

724
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:46,890
well it worked he hypothesized that

725
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:50,790
there was in ninth criteria that wasn't

726
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:54,360
divulged to the public and blocks

727
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:57,450
differential crypt analysis which was

728
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,639
exactly right but of course that was

729
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,310
published in nineteen ninety and as he

730
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:08,400
did that we announced the des was no

731
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:10,230
longer certified for use so the whole

732
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,960
thing played itself out really

733
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,210
beautifully just at the time when when

734
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,100
it was announced that NSA had been good

735
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:22,830
guys and had blocked an attack rather

736
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:27,600
than putting in an attack it became

737
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:30,469
attackable in real life the timing was

738
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,060
perfect the analysis was beautiful I

739
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,889
remember he was giving a talk when I

740
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,009
talked at our say Adi gave a talk the

741
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,799
next day about public crypt analysis of

742
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,370
da the public

743
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,260
roll and he was talking about his

744
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,819
relationship with NSA how he used to

745
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,679
send letters to the director with his

746
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,050
ideas on Krypto and the director would

747
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,360
send it back nice letters now the

748
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:56,020
director wasn't send him letters he was

749
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,730
signing the letters but but all of the

750
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,780
outside crypto stuff was coming to me

751
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:04,240
and most of it was what you might expect

752
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,130
to would be but sometimes you get

753
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,600
somebody like like a Shamir who's

754
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,350
actually telling you really good stuff

755
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,910
and so you know I'd write very nice

756
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,430
letters back to him the director would

757
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,080
send him he actually flashed one up at

758
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,549
the board and i start i started laughing

759
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,920
he said weightman have you seen this

760
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:27,970
letter i said yes on that letter he said

761
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,560
did you write that letter and i'm

762
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:34,930
sitting about 20 rows back in the

763
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:37,150
auditorium smiling yeah you know it

764
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,359
there are a lot of brilliant guys on the

765
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:43,720
outside doing really good work in it I

766
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,350
think this des was a really really

767
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,930
important good thing it gave us all an

768
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:52,270
opportunity to work together to share in

769
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,040
in this knowledge in the development and

770
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,290
there's been a lot of work since then

771
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,920
really good work where people are having

772
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,810
great ideas that we all benefit from you

773
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,980
know for me it's we want to get secure

774
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:07,779
stuff out there we want to protect

775
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:10,120
ourselves and I think it's it only aids

776
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,490
us all when we have more knowledge but

777
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,170
this was one of the really really

778
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:19,180
exciting events it brought the public in

779
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:22,080
it used a fairly a fairly simple

780
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:25,569
algorithm people could look at yeah you

781
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,509
when you're talking about s-boxes 0 to

782
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:31,240
15 people can see those numbers they can

783
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:33,520
understand them it's not like you're

784
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,959
using a permutation on 0 2 256 just too

785
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,550
big and too complicated for people look

786
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,900
at when you're talking about 30 to 15

787
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,780
people can look at it they can see

788
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,100
patterns they can have ideas mail and

789
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,140
dwell when he was this design I think

790
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,140
Nolan was the best designer ever knew he

791
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,509
also said you know I want to design my

792
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,589
algorithm so that's this much better

793
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,690
than required

794
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,499
because I know if it's this much better

795
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,940
you're not going to spend any time

796
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:57,439
looking at it you're going to go after

797
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,599
somebody else's junk that you know you

798
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,920
can beat but if I tantalize you with

799
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,119
something that's this much better i know

800
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,160
you're going to spend time looking at my

801
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,630
thing and i want you to try to evaluate

802
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,719
eiler know if there's something wrong

803
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:12,349
with it so that was kind of the golden

804
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,319
rule you don't try to hide security hide

805
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,469
insecurity with complexity you want it

806
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:22,489
to be obviously secure you don't want to

807
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:25,670
make it a complexity problem spaghetti

808
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:29,599
code we used to call it you want to you

809
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,099
want to be close des was close now that

810
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,289
differential cryptanalytic attack that

811
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:36,979
was just about exhaustion lot of text

812
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:39,140
required a lot of text ton of texts but

813
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:41,210
but it was about it was about it

814
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,538
exhaustion it was and it was really cool

815
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,190
of this this whole story was great and I

816
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:49,400
think it was a nice opportunity for the

817
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:52,279
world to see ya you know NSA can play

818
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:57,890
fair when I was on the stage with with

819
00:37:52,279 --> 00:38:00,910
with the ADI and and marty and witten in

820
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:04,129
Ronda they said did you think about

821
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:07,399
hooking it and I said not for a second

822
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,749
because i knew i wasn't smart enough to

823
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,109
build a hook in that you guys wouldn't

824
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:14,718
find some time in the next 15 years and

825
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:18,799
that was really true that was that was

826
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,119
that's the big story for crypto and NSA

827
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:25,279
we're smart enough to know we aren't

828
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:27,200
smart enough to do that and that's just

829
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:30,529
not a good thing to do the good thing to

830
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,680
do is talk on you build it right and if

831
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:35,960
we build it right and implement it right

832
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:40,219
the country wins that that's all it

833
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,529
takes and you know we we got the best

834
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:45,529
designers we got the best developers in

835
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:48,979
the world that's how we win that's how

836
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:51,650
we got the es that internet think really

837
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:55,069
kind of threw a monkey wrench in but

838
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:57,739
yeah yeah that was that was the that was

839
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:59,749
the one thing I didn't foresee I knew we

840
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:00,950
were given him a good problem but I

841
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:04,009
thought people would be working in

842
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,149
isolation doggone it they weren't they

843
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,730
were all working together

844
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,740
and what a tremendous boon that's been

845
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,680
for the world to be able to work on

846
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:15,529
problems like that in a group it's

847
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:20,509
really really nice to see so they asked

848
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:21,890
me what my biggest regret was when I saw

849
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,529
the work was being done and I said my

850
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,940
biggest regret is it you know I got to

851
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,680
write letters to Adi about his good

852
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,210
ideas but they weren't coming from me I

853
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,740
would have loved to be able to work with

854
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,069
him that would that would have been a

855
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,720
really cool thing for me and I was stuck

856
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:37,190
in this little closed I only I had a

857
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,799
thousand people to work with but I

858
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,089
didn't have him and I think it would

859
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:43,279
have would have been really neat for me

860
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,990
to have to be able to work with them so

861
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:47,270
that that's the biggest regret that I

862
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,459
have is that we we don't get to work

863
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:54,109
with everybody we are locked up by this

864
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,900
classification system I remember Brian

865
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:58,730
snow at one of the rsas they asked him

866
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,589
if they thought NSA would stay ahead of

867
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,109
the world in crypto and he said of

868
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:05,808
course because we get to see everything

869
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,308
that everybody else publishes and you

870
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:09,109
don't get to see anything we publish if

871
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:14,089
we can't stay ahead of you will really

872
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:16,700
suck yes it just add to the record a

873
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:19,279
little bit dougie a number of places

874
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:23,899
sort of extended the life of des or at

875
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:25,700
least their use of it with the ds3 any

876
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,390
comment you want to make around that

877
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:32,390
please do sure so Triple DES where use

878
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:34,460
three de esas together it's it's nice

879
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,930
for one reason if you use the same as

880
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,000
variable to decrypt and encrypt and

881
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:41,180
decrypt it it's compatible with a single

882
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,660
des it's solid it's a little bit longer

883
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,308
but we got over worrying about the

884
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,109
government using that by that time so

885
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:53,720
that was not a big deal for us I don't

886
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:55,910
think that the politicians for saw that

887
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,009
and I don't think that that the techies

888
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,500
were we're thinking that was going to

889
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,059
happen either because we thought you

890
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,039
know this thing is going to last it's

891
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,829
five or six years and be replaced by

892
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,539
something else but not Triple DES the

893
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:10,940
reason we didn't think Triple DES was

894
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:14,630
because of the efficiency you know it's

895
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:17,280
it's three times slower and everybody's

896
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,730
looking for faster not slower

897
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,490
so you know you can take almost any any

898
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,700
algorithm and run a thousand rounds on

899
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:28,709
it you're probably okay it's just the

900
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:32,339
throughput is going to be terrible so

901
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:36,030
just just as a side note remember when

902
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:38,970
the call for des came out there were

903
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:42,180
only there was only one real applicant

904
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:44,549
for it when the call for AES came out

905
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,870
and that one des guy was a guy who

906
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,630
worked with NSA on Krypto so this was

907
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:54,029
not a pure commercial guy but when a es

908
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,860
came out there were about 15 proposals

909
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,080
and they were almost all from private

910
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,520
guys in fact the only one that really

911
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,580
had anything wrong with it was the

912
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,500
German government submission all the

913
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:09,230
private ones were good and that shows

914
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,230
how far the commercial world had come

915
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:20,820
yes Mike police because they're

916
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:22,620
recording I apologize I'm probably the

917
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,750
least intelligent person in this room

918
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,940
and I don't have the background and all

919
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,740
the things you're talking about I went

920
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,150
to UCLA right after the ARPANET thing

921
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:36,500
started stuff it sounds to me like

922
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:41,190
you're talking about messages in your

923
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:43,140
encryption continuous conversation the

924
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:47,040
same thing the internet grew up out of

925
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:51,870
is that as opposed to single

926
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:54,240
transactions so des could be used in any

927
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,770
way and most of it really was commercial

928
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,629
stuff it was banking stuff so it was

929
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,950
transactions and that kind of data but

930
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,650
it could have been used in any way and

931
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,960
probably was I'm sure I'm sure

932
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,350
conversations were like resident single

933
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,180
transaction create a simpler base to

934
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:11,339
where you can encrypt everything

935
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,649
differently each time as long as you

936
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,480
keep a record of how to decrypt that if

937
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,510
it's needed you mean change the crypt of

938
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,970
air bleach time yep not not back then

939
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,700
because changing the crypto it's not

940
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,430
like there was no RSA back then okay so

941
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,890
it was it was all that paper taste three

942
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:30,419
have different types of but the way you

943
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,859
approach them though

944
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,260
so you could do something like add a

945
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:37,109
counter in each time but nobody did yeah

946
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,599
I'll tell you that you're talking key

947
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:40,890
management and the world did not much as

948
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,970
they didn't understand crypto they

949
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,440
really didn't understand commander

950
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,169
that's where the problem is growing up

951
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,290
commercially today yeah thnkx can't keep

952
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:52,170
you out of their storage records you

953
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,910
can't protect a record from a merchant

954
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,440
merchant sorry have to store all the

955
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,839
stuff the banks have to store all the

956
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,780
stuff everything goes on on the Internet

957
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,150
today has to be stored and you can't use

958
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,980
a single coding for that because if

959
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:07,589
somebody figures out how to I mean this

960
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,380
is way it's it's seeming to me if

961
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:12,990
somebody figures out the one log and get

962
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,400
into everything yeah but that key

963
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,649
management is hard though it's really

964
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,960
cumbersome for anybody to do and so you

965
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,540
have that trade-off you also have to

966
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,130
remember that if you've got something

967
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,109
that's managing key then that's going to

968
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,069
be the target they're not going after

969
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,660
the data they're going to go after the

970
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:29,040
key management and do after that so

971
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,500
you've got to watch out for that that's

972
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,700
the that's the real Holy Grail because

973
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,839
if you get that you can get everything

974
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,910
so you also have to worry about if

975
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:41,490
you're storing everything everything in

976
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,930
a huge database well yeah you you want

977
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,009
to have different encryption for each

978
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,299
one because you don't want to decrypt

979
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,309
the whole thing to get to this thing you

980
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:50,549
want to go after a piece by piece so

981
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:53,609
yeah but back in the early days of des

982
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:56,609
that wasn't the game I think yeah the

983
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:58,049
game was I'll tell you we we went to a

984
00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:00,328
bank in New York and they were saying

985
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:02,069
they were taking us through saying and

986
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:03,480
we're using des for this here and we're

987
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,529
using it back in this system here and

988
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,210
we're using it here we're using here

989
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,040
amusing here and finally one of the guy

990
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,010
said well that's a lot of uses what are

991
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,270
you doing for key management and the

992
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,680
security guy said that's the good news

993
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,040
we don't need key management it came

994
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,040
with key

995
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:40,179
which point you say okay that's true

996
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:41,919
story by the way sad but true any

997
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:43,119
questions remember this is being

998
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,408
recorded in any question you have

999
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,629
somebody else is going to wish somebody

1000
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:49,379
had asked not so much fun Dez but you

1001
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:51,848
have any comments about blockchain and

1002
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:56,348
Internet of Things and topics like that

1003
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:57,969
as it relates to crypto yeah I mean

1004
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:59,709
Internet of Things it's going to be a

1005
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:01,239
bear yeah you've already got

1006
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:06,279
refrigerators that are spamming the

1007
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:07,949
world and being parts of botnets the

1008
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:11,079
medical devices I think of the most

1009
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:13,809
problematic because if someone says you

1010
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,609
kind of fib you later in here you don't

1011
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:16,839
want that you don't want it password

1012
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,189
encrypted cuz if something goes wrong

1013
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:19,749
you want that guy to be able to find out

1014
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,828
what's going on you want anybody there

1015
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:23,138
to be able to find out what's going on

1016
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:26,349
but that means has got to be open so

1017
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:27,579
that anybody can also do anything now I

1018
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,469
was in a meeting the other day it seems

1019
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,569
like seems like every everybody in this

1020
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:33,669
blasted meeting it was not an APL

1021
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:36,149
meeting it was a community thing that

1022
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:38,138
we're putting on a cyber conference

1023
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:41,169
everybody there seemed to have some kind

1024
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:43,209
of a a body pump that was given them

1025
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:46,089
stuff for some kind of a diabetic

1026
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:47,229
condition type 2 diabetes or whatever

1027
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:49,239
but they're all talking about that and

1028
00:46:47,229 --> 00:46:50,709
saying well you know I sometimes I said

1029
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,619
it for this insolence sometime I said it

1030
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:56,558
for that insulin I'm thinking you know

1031
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:58,869
that that changing that setting if you

1032
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,209
can do that remotely somebody else can

1033
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:03,249
do that remotely and if you've got the

1034
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,359
wrong setting for the insulin you're

1035
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:06,279
getting that's probably not a good

1036
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:11,828
situation these this stuff is really

1037
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:14,379
scary it's also true that it well beyond

1038
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,649
des now one of the things we're thinking

1039
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:19,449
about is what's next after RSA if you

1040
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:21,999
believe in quantum computers then you

1041
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:23,889
need to worry about that and I think we

1042
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:25,839
do need to worry about that and when I

1043
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:28,209
say we it's not NSA it's the world needs

1044
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,680
to worry about that i was i was talking

1045
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:31,839
to one of the guys

1046
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,000
who's a professor in saying well you

1047
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,920
know it's it's only the government that

1048
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,140
has this intelligence life it would just

1049
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,490
wait until someone really builds one and

1050
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,009
then we'll change that stuff right away

1051
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,569
and I said you know number one you're

1052
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,700
not gonna change it right away it's good

1053
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:47,440
it's going to take a while and number

1054
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,450
two it's not true that's only the

1055
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,190
government has intelligence life you've

1056
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,970
got your health records you've got your

1057
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:57,880
your investment your banking all that

1058
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:00,069
stuff but health in particular you're

1059
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,470
that stuff is not going to change over

1060
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:04,240
time you've got to protect that and

1061
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:07,000
you've got to understand that that's

1062
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,529
maybe not for me but for my grandkids

1063
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,839
their their health records going to be

1064
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,720
important 50 years from now might be for

1065
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:14,920
me see how lucky I am now some of that

1066
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,629
some of the things on the internet of

1067
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,760
things are likely to remain unchanged

1068
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,430
for 15 or 20 years because they're built

1069
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,319
in two big devices so I'm going to put

1070
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:26,410
you on the spot with two questions okay

1071
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:33,509
the first one is are you actually sattui

1072
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:35,848
she Nakamoto perhaps good answer and the

1073
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:42,339
those of you don't know you can google

1074
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:44,859
and the second one is I'll state my

1075
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:46,990
opinion so it's on the record as well I

1076
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:48,848
think it is wrong to build in

1077
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,649
intentional weaknesses for law

1078
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:52,780
enforcement access to personal

1079
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,480
communications because that weakens

1080
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,569
everything and for all governments and

1081
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,970
that's not necessarily a good result

1082
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:03,630
that's my opinion do you have anything

1083
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:06,549
you'd like to say on the subject sure

1084
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:10,420
you're writing first for a number of

1085
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:12,099
reasons there's ubiquitous crypto out

1086
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,599
there there's no way you're going to be

1087
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:16,690
able to design it so the bad guys are

1088
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,750
vulnerable the really bad guys you might

1089
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,849
be able to pick up some some fool who's

1090
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,049
doing something the little guy you're

1091
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:26,109
not getting the big guys you might get a

1092
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:27,670
little guy but there's no question

1093
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,098
you're going to put everybody else at

1094
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:33,460
risk because you're not going to be able

1095
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:35,260
to contain the access to that law

1096
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,640
enforcement field other governments are

1097
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,099
going to have it even if it's only in

1098
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,980
the u.s. if you're going to give it to

1099
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:43,269
police departments it's gone all you're

1100
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,829
going to do is put the average

1101
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:46,238
citizen at risk you're not you're not

1102
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:48,369
really going to do anything beneficial

1103
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,709
for law enforcement but you are going to

1104
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:54,909
pretty much put everybody else of the

1105
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:57,640
creek so if even if the government

1106
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,719
designs it if you can't let commercial

1107
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,969
people design it they will they will

1108
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,609
screw it up I get back when we were

1109
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:05,169
doing this the Scalia stuff I used to

1110
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:07,479
see stuff from companies all the time

1111
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:09,038
and I would beg them not to try to do it

1112
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:10,749
because they were totally incompetent at

1113
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,269
designing this stuff they didn't have

1114
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:17,198
crypto guys even your big companies did

1115
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:20,348
not have crypto guys I was on a on a

1116
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:22,089
piano one time it was a talking to the

1117
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:24,039
National Academy of Sciences talking on

1118
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:29,769
developmental of workforce they want to

1119
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:32,199
know how many savvy cyber people Crips a

1120
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:34,928
crypto cyber cyber people you had to

1121
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,759
have they asked me first I said Johns

1122
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,279
Hopkins we have 5,000 people I need a

1123
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:43,989
thousand people that are really good and

1124
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:45,999
I need everybody to be pretty good they

1125
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:50,499
would to cisco they asked the cisco guy

1126
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:53,019
he said we've got 30,000 people i need

1127
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:55,538
300 of them to understand cyber security

1128
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:59,468
I think at cisco you need 300 people

1129
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:01,269
you've got to be kidding you know if

1130
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:05,139
it's not 15,000 you're not doing your

1131
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:06,609
job so you know to think they're gonna

1132
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:08,349
do that by the way next guy was John

1133
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:12,058
Deere he said I have 60,000 people I

1134
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:12,059
need 12 who know something about cyber I

1135
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:20,380
said 12 how do you keep your network up

1136
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:22,599
with 12 yeah I said your time I said

1137
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:32,409
you're 12 any good he said I don't know

1138
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:33,609
maybe how would I know but so so there

1139
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:36,119
are plenty of jobs for cyber security

1140
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:36,119
guys

1141
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:44,150
yeah that's good I spent a lot of time

1142
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,369
talking to the guy and he just said you

1143
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,829
know I don't have a threat model and I

1144
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:52,400
got to be able to sell it to them to the

1145
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:54,740
board and without any kind of a threat

1146
00:51:52,400 --> 00:52:03,040
model I can't convince him I need to

1147
00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:08,240
spend money on cybersecurity chimp ooh

1148
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,740
yeah so my question is any predictions

1149
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,390
on when we should start worrying about

1150
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,109
quantum computers that could actually

1151
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:19,129
break for real crypto crypto yeah you

1152
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:22,670
know that is such a good question it

1153
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:30,050
seems like about 30 years ago I was told

1154
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:32,420
they were 20 years away yeah we keep

1155
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,609
hearing it's 20 years away I don't know

1156
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,089
if we ever get there but if we don't get

1157
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:40,940
there it'll be for one of two reasons

1158
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:42,710
something better happened or there's no

1159
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,480
commercial market for it because right

1160
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,040
now it's not much good for anything but

1161
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,720
but that then we don't have a lot of

1162
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,430
algorithm all the algorithms that seem

1163
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,980
to be very efficient will solve that

1164
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:56,720
kind of problem so NSA has already come

1165
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,300
out and said that we should start

1166
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,220
thinking about the follow-on a so I

1167
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,410
think that that's good advice the

1168
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,810
the follow-on to RSA they should start

1169
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,578
thinking about what is going to replace

1170
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,380
it for the world because NSA right now

1171
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,450
is using commercial stuff almost

1172
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,040
exclusively even the stuff they build

1173
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,109
themselves is called suite b which is

1174
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,779
still exactly the same algorithms that

1175
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:20,060
are used in the commercial stuff so we

1176
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,369
it's not going to be NSA coming up with

1177
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,890
a government version it's going to be we

1178
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:27,380
as a country maybe we as o is a world

1179
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,328
need to come up with the next one is it

1180
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,880
lattice based I don't know the problem

1181
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:34,310
with lattice basis looks good but how

1182
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,980
much work has really been done you know

1183
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,990
no it hasn't been labeled as the answer

1184
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,190
yet and when it's labeled as the answer

1185
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,680
that's when you're going to get the

1186
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,420
really good work on it until people

1187
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,618
think it's it's the problem to solve

1188
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,520
you're not going to get people trying to

1189
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:50,220
solve it

1190
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,930
it's going to say the quantum who will

1191
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,660
break all the public key crypto but

1192
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:58,710
symmetric keys I mean you're still not

1193
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:01,770
going to break aes with so so it's it

1194
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:05,160
helps it takes it down to basically the

1195
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:08,580
square root square root of huge well

1196
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:10,649
squirts so it takes it from 256 to 128

1197
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,990
but there's also a big coefficient

1198
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:16,050
outside so it's so it's a lot of work I

1199
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:17,879
was to the to the 128 where as opposed

1200
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,790
to a little work down to the 250 it it's

1201
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,740
still around to the 192 so yeah this the

1202
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,330
symmetric stuff is good and maybe we

1203
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,029
just go back to the 70s when we use

1204
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:30,750
symmetric to rekey symmetric yeah you

1205
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:32,130
can do that I want to lead you to when I

1206
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,540
asked about IOT I was thinking of a

1207
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,700
lightweight crypto and ask for any

1208
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,980
speculation you have on the viability

1209
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:42,000
some people say if I can do an IP stack

1210
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:45,240
I can do crypto if others say not you

1211
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,070
want to speculate so there actually has

1212
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,060
been work on lightweight crypto and

1213
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,820
they're trying to come up with something

1214
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:54,120
that might be a good standard I think I

1215
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,790
think it's a good problem because with

1216
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,140
these with the little devices the stuff

1217
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:01,020
they're putting in refrigerators there's

1218
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,129
not a lot of horsepower there now it

1219
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,940
could be by the time they come up with

1220
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,380
something there'll be a lot more

1221
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,090
horsepower there you know when you think

1222
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:10,080
about what's in your watch compared to

1223
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:13,710
what was in a computer in the IAD 30

1224
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,240
years ago so it's about the same so it

1225
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,860
could be could be the refrigerator is

1226
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,529
going to be smart as a car that can

1227
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:23,550
drive itself hopefully refrigerator

1228
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:27,410
doesn't leave the house but yeah but it

1229
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,410
could have that kind of horsepower in it

1230
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,059
okay thank you very much
