1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,480
today I'm happy to introduce D Jin he's

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,079
the advance

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,779
leader in the GM product cybersecurity

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,369
organization where he works with GM R&D

5
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,369
and engineering teams

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:27,579
prior to joining GM he worked as the

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:30,939
senior security Technical Specialist at

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:34,600
Chrysler he began his career as the lead

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:36,910
security engineer at GM OnStar he

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,160
received his PhD from the University of

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,890
Oklahoma in electrical engineering and

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,620
Computer Engineering today he will be

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:47,920
giving us an introduction to the GM

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:51,578
product cybersecurity organization right

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,770
all right so Thank You professor Maji

16
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,739
for the introduction and thanks for the

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,649
serious invitation for me to come over

18
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,870
here and present our GM products up a

19
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:04,780
security overview I'm very pleased to

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,800
come over here and I'm very excited to

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,800
present what we are doing and in the

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,990
current effort so the the presentation

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,080
today will cover various different

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,339
topics within the cyber security at a

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,800
fairly high level at a fairly high level

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,970
it will cover things like the cyber

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,289
security ecosystem the connected

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,220
connectivity increased the connectivity

29
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:36,429
and also the attack surfaces the the

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,970
lack of cyber security patterns our

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:42,700
cyber security vulnerability disclosure

32
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,709
programs etcetera etcetera and also

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,229
things like external internal

34
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:56,470
development and external collaborations

35
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:59,200
as such so the cyber security has become

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,050
a really hot topic for pretty much all

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,780
the industry and specifically for

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,590
automotive industry there has been a lot

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,590
of news recently if you follow some of

40
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,349
the news you can use here a lot of news

41
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,840
and articles talking about automotive

42
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,290
cyber security not only GM but basically

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,359
the industrial cross across the board

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,939
you know when you are in this cyber

45
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:27,340
security business you want to hear all

46
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,430
the good news which you know

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,280
of those good things that happened that

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,580
GM has been working on or reported and

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,720
that's good and you don't want you to be

50
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:44,260
in the sort of the other spectrum so the

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,959
IOT really is the internet of everything

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,340
right now and the vehicle is part of the

53
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,769
overall IOT system so the the consumers

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,000
around the world has constantly requests

55
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,630
you know constant to connect

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,209
connectivities to their devices and also

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:11,579
the just a seamless connection feature

58
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:15,370
and a performance so it's predicted that

59
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:18,750
by the year of 2020 there will be about

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,060
50 billion of connected devices

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,640
connected to the Internet which if you

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,970
think about it is effectively but

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,768
approximately seven devices per person

64
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:36,880
on the earth which is a huge amount so

65
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:40,450
among some of the various type of

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,810
connected devices only about 10 billion

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,599
would be like your smart phones and

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:50,260
tablets the rest are the machines that

69
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,298
you typically don't see but they are

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,429
connected to each other and they are

71
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,930
talking to each other things like the

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,510
you know various type of sensors the

73
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,489
smart power meters and you know things

74
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:09,578
like that there are a lot of other

75
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:12,730
things like the point-of-sale and ATM

76
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:20,918
machines just a lot of different various

77
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:24,789
of things so for GM we recognize the

78
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:28,539
need of products of security and we we

79
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:34,120
are the first automaker to have to

80
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:37,180
create a dedicated a integrated and a

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,330
global organization for products of

82
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,260
security this centralized organization

83
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,349
handles the cyber

84
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:49,020
the vehicle cybersecurity aspect of our

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:52,780
whole product so you can see that our

86
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:56,400
this is our world Technical Center which

87
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:00,090
is in Warren Michigan and our head

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,250
cooperate headquarter is in Detroit and

89
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,770
specifically in the Renaissance Center

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,100
building this is our core technical

91
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:13,330
competency we're very sad we also have

92
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:17,770
engineers in the Palo Alto team and GM

93
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,500
in Germany and also Israel we have our

94
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,200
Advanced Technology Center over there we

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,960
also have some other affiliated

96
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,710
engineers that are working in the Korea

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,799
in China and South America region so

98
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,020
it's truly global organization so the

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,630
organization was created three four

100
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,950
years ago started with a handful of

101
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:46,800
engineers and and managers and now has

102
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:50,050
grown into a team of over 80 people 80

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,600
internal experts on various different

104
00:05:50,050 --> 00:06:02,860
things and the team will continue to

105
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:06,120
grow over time so the automotive

106
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:10,390
industry nowadays is changing very fast

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,270
in the last five years than any given

108
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,590
time in automotive history of the past

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,450
100 years

110
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:22,960
so our CEO actually once upon time said

111
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,530
that she will expect there is more

112
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,609
change in the next five years then it

113
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,979
has in the last 50 years so you can see

114
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,730
the dramatic change of the automotive

115
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:40,110
space will potentially pose some

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:44,170
challenges in the cyber security area I

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:49,020
can give you a couple examples so for

118
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:51,910
example in 2017 GM will have its first

119
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,139
vehicle that supports vehicle to vehicle

120
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,879
communication

121
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:02,300
verities this are our 2017 Cadillac CTS

122
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,939
and another example is that where we're

123
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:10,249
going to have a so called supercruise

124
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:13,189
capability only 2017 Cadillac ct-6 which

125
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:16,610
is our flex flagship you know sedan

126
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:19,759
luxury sedan so the supercruise

127
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:23,689
capability what it is is that it

128
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,919
provides your hands-free experience and

129
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:30,529
capability on the divided highway it's

130
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,590
gotten limitations if you got to be on

131
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:36,680
the divided highway it you utilize the

132
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,020
advanced the GPS technology to first

133
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,529
making first make sure that you are

134
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,919
actually only divided highway otherwise

135
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:49,550
the system of won't engage at all so it

136
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,900
also utilized some other advanced

137
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:57,069
monitoring capability to make sure that

138
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:00,859
the driver you know pays attention as

139
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,889
the the vehicle is moving at a certain

140
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,099
specific time interval to make to make

141
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,349
sure that the driver is constantly

142
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:14,389
paying attention of the vehicle

143
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:20,750
condition so this kind of echoes what

144
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:26,689
our CEO stated before so the GM OnStar

145
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:29,750
has responded 1.3 billion button presses

146
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:33,519
and customer requests over the past of

147
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:38,029
20 years I'll start first a launched in

148
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,219
1996 which is the first of its kind in

149
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:45,790
the in the industry and where the

150
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:49,269
industry leader in a telematics pace so

151
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,709
really if you think about it 1.3 billion

152
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:55,339
button press response that's like a

153
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:58,279
every person in China or in India press

154
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:06,100
the button twice which is a pretty

155
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:07,850
significant our global volume will have

156
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,980
75%

157
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,740
and that's that will have connectivity

158
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,829
feature by the year of 2020

159
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,470
so which further demonstrate the

160
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:25,040
increased connectivity feature of our

161
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:29,750
current modern vehicles so as you can

162
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:35,209
see from the presentation slides there

163
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:38,120
are many different kinds of potential

164
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,089
attack surfaces right if you kind of a

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,519
categorize it it's gotten some some of

166
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,160
those are wired some of those are

167
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,350
Wireless and even for wireless you got

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,189
short range and the longer range right

169
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,839
so if we talk about for example the the

170
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,959
wired connections

171
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,440
you got a USB port in the vehicle some

172
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:06,410
some vehicle has an SD card port some

173
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:08,870
still got a disk a CD in it and there's

174
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,240
this wired in the electrical vehicle

175
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,009
charging station is also another thing

176
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,490
that is you know connected to the

177
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:21,439
vehicle it connects to the smart with

178
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:24,560
the to the power grid and also for

179
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:30,040
example you got phone projections right

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:34,819
you have the Google and enjoy enjoyed

181
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,639
enjoyed the auto and the apple carplay

182
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:40,550
you can hook up your phone through USB

183
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,740
and your phone spring will be projected

184
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,889
onto the vehicle well later I'll show

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,589
some picture of that and that feature

186
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:54,709
even can be executed through a wireless

187
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:57,199
thing and also you have a DLC so call so

188
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:01,670
to speak that's that they link connector

189
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:05,300
which essentially is the obd2 port which

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,729
is onboard diagnostics so it serves as

191
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,269
the purpose of you know for the service

192
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,660
mechanics to diagnose what's wrong with

193
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:16,250
the vehicle it is mandated by the

194
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:21,410
legislation that you know every vehicle

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:27,860
that's produced after the year of 1996

196
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:32,300
we'll have such a port so now speaking

197
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:36,399
of the wireless connections you've

198
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,508
gotten the the Bluetooth the near-field

199
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:45,350
communications you've got Wi-Fi

200
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:49,490
you got the V 2 V 2 V and V 2 vehicle to

201
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,920
infrastructure the SRC dedicated short

202
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,839
range communications so this this

203
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,189
communication channels are sort of

204
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,100
shorter range to medium range now other

205
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:06,469
than those you you've got the GPS the

206
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:08,750
Sirius XM's the am/fm radios HD radios

207
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,339
you've got a cellular 3g 4g cetera

208
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:15,730
networks so those are longer range which

209
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:23,930
you know can enable a lot of features

210
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:27,680
that is very convenient so the growth of

211
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,439
the infotainment and telematics features

212
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:35,149
have introduced many wireless

213
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:38,029
connections and as such the attack

214
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,610
surface is increasing so we are we need

215
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,269
to do a division work to make sure that

216
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:47,949
you know those increase the

217
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:54,110
connectivities doesn't produce a

218
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:56,990
security vulnerability so now moving

219
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,350
forward I'd like to talk a little about

220
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,170
the cyber security ecosystem so our

221
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:08,630
organization is the overall responsible

222
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:10,790
for the end-to-end system so from

223
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,970
end-to-end standpoint we have the

224
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,410
vehicle on the one end and we have the

225
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,620
back office that the vehicle is

226
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,259
communicating with and in between is the

227
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,589
telematics channel that's sitting over

228
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:27,800
there so each one component so to speak

229
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:30,350
we will have its own characteristic and

230
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,910
presents its own unique cybersecurity

231
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:39,020
risks and we need a

232
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:44,060
friend set of tactics to handle in a

233
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:51,770
tackle the cybersecurity problems so our

234
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:54,739
team is composed of various different

235
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,680
teams with our teams some of which are

236
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,590
working on the in vehicle ECU security

237
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,900
some of those are working on the connect

238
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,180
connected the ECU electronic until

239
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,420
control unit that will talk to the

240
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,989
backend and we also have a team that's

241
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,640
focusing on secure the tenant

242
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,430
telecommunication part with our

243
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,290
telecommunication partners and we also

244
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:22,910
have a dedicated IT vehicle facing IT

245
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,089
security team that's a little bit

246
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,270
different from the traditional IT

247
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:33,260
backhaul phase you know from the

248
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:35,810
perspective that is its vehicle facing

249
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:40,910
is handling vehicle services and

250
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:42,859
requests and things like that so we are

251
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,949
looking at the server security posture

252
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,990
family I am - and perspective and we're

253
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,480
implementing defense-in-depth

254
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,260
strategies to make sure that we have

255
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,500
multiple layer of protections to the

256
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:00,590
whole ecosystem in cybersecurity there

257
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,340
is no silver bullet for any kind of

258
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:07,850
industry so a better strategy is that we

259
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,970
have we got to put multiple layer to

260
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:18,530
protect art our you know core interest

261
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:23,540
there so now let me go into a little bit

262
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:26,930
detail to talk about these our cyber

263
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:30,530
security team also has a dedicated rep

264
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:34,939
team supporting our internal penetration

265
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:40,339
testing which is very much needed is a

266
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:46,910
team of certified ethical hacker that

267
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:48,230
has great expertise in hacking embedded

268
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,870
systems

269
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,540
our physical systems they have great

270
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,390
understanding of the whole ecosystem how

271
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:04,130
it works and how its protein is putted

272
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:06,830
together so we as a mission before we

273
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,570
ought we took them the defense-in-depth

274
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:13,490
and I will be speaking a little bit more

275
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:16,700
in the following slide so we do a one

276
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:20,420
step further now in terms of defense in

277
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,050
depth in depth you design a security

278
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,050
solution from the very beginning of

279
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:30,140
Purdue of building a car right build

280
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:33,410
security built vehicle with security in

281
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,260
mind can secure he is if you are

282
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:39,530
patching it has this cost a whole lot

283
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:44,300
more money then it is built it works

284
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:47,300
built in in the beginning so we took one

285
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:50,240
step further to say hey we we got a

286
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,370
secure solution but the the cyber

287
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,240
security landscape constantly changing

288
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,340
is this dynamic nature is it's very much

289
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,430
its nature because you know the

290
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:04,190
attackers can become stronger day after

291
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,740
day we become stronger they up there as

292
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:10,250
well but we need to constantly

293
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,010
constantly monitoring what's going on in

294
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,599
the vehicle it was was was sand from the

295
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,420
vehicle to the back hand and pump back

296
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:21,760
into the vehicle and we need to detect

297
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:25,520
if there is any sign of intrusion or

298
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,530
anomaly and we need to quickly respond

299
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:35,420
to any event that is suspicious so we've

300
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:38,360
we built a capability in detecting

301
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:46,840
monitoring and responding to a

302
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:49,100
cybersecurity event in our team so

303
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,580
another thing that I'd like to mention

304
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,980
is that the security these

305
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,050
vulnerabilities disclosure program which

306
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,860
i will talk have been warned in detail

307
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,100
in the following slides but GM has

308
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,189
launched

309
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:10,909
a disclosure program started upon that

310
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:14,450
January this year and we have received

311
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:18,970
ample amount of submissions from the

312
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:22,400
white hat hacker or what had what had

313
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:26,030
researchers so to speak the the research

314
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,700
community so many of which are IT

315
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:32,629
general IT related issues and some

316
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:36,320
missions a few of those are vehicle

317
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:39,679
related submissions and our team is

318
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,280
working diligently to assess the issue

319
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,850
to talk to the researchers constantly to

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,220
understand better what the issue was and

321
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:54,830
to come up with a solution to address

322
00:18:49,220 --> 00:19:00,500
any potential concerns over there so and

323
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:06,129
also in addition to that GM really views

324
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:11,750
cybersecurity not as a competitor

325
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:17,539
advantage so we really view it as not a

326
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:22,460
collaborative a competitor advantage but

327
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:27,980
as a systemic concern that the whole

328
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:31,070
industry needs to be you know needs to

329
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,049
pay attention and ultimately the whole

330
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,280
industry serves a collection of

331
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:40,389
customers which is the society can only

332
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,299
be better served if we work

333
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:55,870
collaboratively to fight against that

334
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:59,900
the hackers so we joined the automotive

335
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:05,209
Isacc information sharing and analysis

336
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:09,290
Center which is a group of automotive

337
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,900
OEMs all together there are now 15 OMS

338
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,850
participating which covers ninety-eight

339
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,360
percent of all the light duty

340
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:22,050
KO's in the north america so that effort

341
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,199
has took off and now a lot of the

342
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:28,590
involvements people so the intent of

343
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,550
that is the auto I stack is that people

344
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:35,399
will become or aliens or the automotive

345
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:38,460
industry become more open in

346
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,190
collaborating with each other to

347
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:47,190
identify the potential trends of the

348
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:49,710
cybersecurity you know effort so to

349
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,440
speak and to identify the potential

350
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,990
cyber security intelligence to share

351
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,930
with the whole community to benefit each

352
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,420
other's to so that everybody is aware

353
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:04,440
and everybody is thinking about how do

354
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,630
we do better so which comes back to the

355
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,900
point where you know cybersecurity is

356
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,490
not a competitive advantage but

357
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,260
everybody needs to work together

358
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:19,350
collaboratively to address the issue it

359
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,520
takes more than a single entity to work

360
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:28,469
on cybersecurity to improve our overall

361
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:32,430
industries our security posture we have

362
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:38,510
built strong relationships with external

363
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:41,820
groups of researchers of you know

364
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:46,370
standardization activities with

365
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,370
universities et cetera so

366
00:21:52,100 --> 00:22:02,929
all right so as the technology are

367
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:07,070
enhancing and the entry point of to the

368
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:10,700
vehicle are increasing so the attacker

369
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:14,629
has gotten more potential place to play

370
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,420
around with to play with around so GM is

371
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,140
focusing on protecting the customers

372
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,530
from the standpoint of the three major

373
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:28,640
categories we protect an anti-theft of

374
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:32,540
vehicles and we protect hacker from

375
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,050
tampering the vehicle our customers

376
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:39,050
safety is our number one priority of the

377
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:41,629
corporation and we are very serious

378
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:44,980
about the privacy of the customer data

379
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:50,780
and data privacy data data security

380
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,880
we also prevent use of harmful softwares

381
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,420
and making sure that there is no

382
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:02,810
counterpart counterfeit part into our

383
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:05,120
supply chain so this is a more of you

384
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:10,129
know the motivation of our cybersecurity

385
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:14,149
efforts and we sell a lot of cars

386
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,160
worldwide under different brand I'm sure

387
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:21,710
everybody here are pretty familiar with

388
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:28,190
that the first of four this is our GM

389
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:31,130
Opel brand and this is a the Vauxhall

390
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:35,960
which is primarily focusing on the

391
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:39,340
England area and this is a Holden New

392
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:44,600
Zealand Australia this is a Baldwin

393
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,530
Wooding and F aw this primarily is a

394
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:52,370
joint venture activity with I think

395
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:56,060
China so our joint venture actually

396
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:59,929
produces almost a half of the volume of

397
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,820
our world worldwide volume so which

398
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,690
represents a significant part of our

399
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,689
sales

400
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,639
okay now let's talk about the

401
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,100
motivations of the adversary's so there

402
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,710
are primarily two types of attacks right

403
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,760
if you think about focusing on the

404
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:25,990
vehicle side you got the infiltration of

405
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,590
the vehicle and caused to influence the

406
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,260
vehicle behavior you got the data

407
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:36,040
exfiltration which can potentially pull

408
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,490
the you know data in the vehicle out and

409
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,600
make use of that so there has been a lot

410
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,430
of work being done by the enthusiasts

411
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,120
and the white hat hackers and

412
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:53,140
researchers in this space and the work

413
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,800
has been going on for a while so our

414
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:59,790
view of the adversary anniversary

415
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:04,419
categories are the following the

416
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:08,399
enthusiasts the hackers hacktivism the

417
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:11,220
entrepreneurs the organized crime

418
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,130
industry in competitors and

419
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:19,180
nation-states so each different

420
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:22,990
adversary's has is different goals and

421
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:26,470
motivations and so far you know what if

422
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,590
we draw a line so far then primary's is

423
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:38,050
right here the white hat hacker is where

424
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:40,600
the current state is that so a lot of

425
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,540
collaborations are happening in this

426
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:50,980
space between the OEMs and the open

427
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:55,330
research community so now let's talk a

428
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,910
little bit about the bit detail but not

429
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,210
so detailed the defense in depth

430
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:05,170
strategy so we have to secure the

431
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:09,000
external and internal / internal of the

432
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:13,090
vehicle to make the layered method and

433
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,880
the attacker must be able to overcome

434
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,399
the different layers to gather a crown

435
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,700
jewel and we are we're going we are

436
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,690
making it very hard for the attackers to

437
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,390
do that so and again to reiterate the

438
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:37,480
ability to monitor detect and response

439
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:40,150
is very critical in this the security

440
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,690
vulnerability disclosure program so GM

441
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:47,260
is actually the first major automotive

442
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:52,270
OEMs that has this program and they

443
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:54,879
started as I said January 2016 so we

444
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:58,210
have see a lot of good collaborations

445
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,620
with the researchers and the team is did

446
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:08,340
it diligently dealing with the issues

447
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:14,770
and talking to the researchers and to

448
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:18,810
get the issue fixed and closed so we

449
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:22,360
collaborate with hacker 1 which is a

450
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:26,710
service provider disclosure service

451
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:30,580
provider of their and the port we have a

452
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,230
portal on the hacker 1 and if you can if

453
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,919
you want to search we can search hacker

454
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:41,710
1 TM that will probably bring you to 2

455
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:44,170
there so why is it important because the

456
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,810
cyber security is one of our top

457
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:51,370
priorities and we really want to make

458
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:55,320
sure that the customer is safe and their

459
00:27:51,370 --> 00:28:00,669
data is secure and our product is safe

460
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:05,950
so by having this disclosure program

461
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:09,990
that will keep us up to date on what the

462
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:14,740
latest of research has represented and

463
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:18,580
to keep us working on improving our

464
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,260
cyber security posture over time so and

465
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,379
it also helps us to maintain our

466
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:28,050
leadership position in the products of a

467
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:31,240
security area we can also identify

468
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,110
potential collaborative relationship

469
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,390
with

470
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:45,219
the researchers so it was very it is

471
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:47,919
very successful to date okay now let's

472
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,399
talk a little bit about the challenges

473
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,690
that the automaker is facing in a

474
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:57,010
cybersecurity space

475
00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:01,750
so the typical automotive automobile has

476
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:04,779
a pretty long life cycle we wear now to

477
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:08,740
define we are now designing vehicle five

478
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:13,480
years down the road and the vehicle will

479
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:16,269
be on the road for another 10 20 20 10

480
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,190
probably 10 11 I heard this the the

481
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:22,840
average stat a statistic is like the

482
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,909
vehicles are on the road for 11 years or

483
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,730
something like that so you could see a

484
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:31,169
long a lot of the vehicle that are even

485
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:34,480
older than that on the road so to

486
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,909
protect vehicles that were is designed

487
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,659
ten years ago is a different story than

488
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:44,500
protecting vehicles that are newly built

489
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:47,320
so is it's just a the nature of the long

490
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,710
product life cycle pose a potential

491
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,960
change potential challenge all

492
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:58,510
maintaining a higher level cyber

493
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,000
security on the older cars the

494
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,399
technology differences between the

495
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,799
commercial the the consumer and of

496
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:11,979
electronics is another challenge let me

497
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,340
give you an example so it in Michigan if

498
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,340
you leave your car or your smartphone in

499
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,529
the car parked in your garage overnight

500
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,080
the next morning when you enter the car

501
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:25,889
picking up your phone what happened

502
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,918
the battery is that right so there is

503
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:34,330
the battery cannot withstand that kind

504
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,190
of temperature but for vehicle we are we

505
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,799
have to design vehicle with very

506
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:44,220
stringent requirement environmental

507
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,929
requirement such as hot cold you know

508
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,659
moisture

509
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:52,360
humidity vibration all of those so which

510
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:55,389
puts a lot of constraints on how the

511
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,519
vehicle can be built and how the vehicle

512
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:01,600
what in what condition the vehicle can

513
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,899
can run so if if we park a car you know

514
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,719
during the night in the winter the next

515
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:10,989
morning the car battery is dead then is

516
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,019
not acceptable and as a matter of fact

517
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:19,389
the car has to withstand some

518
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:21,490
temperature like minus 50 and we have to

519
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,010
make sure not only the works but it will

520
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,950
continue to work in that situation so

521
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:30,370
the it puts a different constraints on

522
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:36,309
the vehicle then the consumer

523
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:44,229
electronics complexity complexity is is

524
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:47,559
a enemy of security so to speak the more

525
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:53,190
complex that the system is then the the

526
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:57,519
more difficult it is to make it secure

527
00:31:53,190 --> 00:32:01,990
for example the the cars in in 2000 only

528
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:05,889
have a 1 million lines of code in the

529
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:10,480
Vienna vehicle now the Chevy Volt that

530
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:14,350
that's introduced in 2010 has tami-lynn

531
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:19,120
whole line of code which is even more

532
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:23,080
than a f-35 fighter jet nowadays the

533
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,870
vehicle on average has 100 million of

534
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,408
code which is if you think about it it's

535
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:31,529
amazing it's much more than a lot of

536
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:39,399
other things you can't think of the

537
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:42,340
bullying of 747 the fighter jet is it's

538
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:46,000
a lot more than that and is gonna is

539
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,240
going to increase to two hundred million

540
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,519
our line of codes in the near future

541
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:57,279
so the which adds a lot of complexity to

542
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,059
the vehicles you can almost say that the

543
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,899
vehicle now

544
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:11,840
is running on ones and zeros almost

545
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:16,189
there you can see that so another thing

546
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:20,809
is that really the cybersecurity tenants

547
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,129
is far less than what's needed the

548
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,940
tenants are you guys

549
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:29,029
which is why GN participated joined

550
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:32,629
Series this year into the program and

551
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:37,429
trying to collaborate with the Purdue

552
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:43,279
and to moving to move forward that

553
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:46,779
educational program to help Purdue to

554
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,309
produce more cybersecurity talents

555
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:54,950
especially in in the cyber physical

556
00:33:49,309 --> 00:34:01,249
space IOT space and automotive specific

557
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:03,950
is the past but Purdue has a long

558
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:06,379
history of the cybersecurity excellence

559
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,629
which is recognized and it's one that's

560
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:20,089
that's why we choose Purdue to

561
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:22,969
collaborate with all right autonomous is

562
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:25,369
another very hot word as a matter of

563
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:28,839
fact I have my colleagues Mike Imoh here

564
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:31,639
who is the autonomous cybersecurity

565
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:35,359
group manager over here supporting me

566
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:42,589
and in this presentation I'm glad that

567
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:45,230
Mike made it so autonomous vehicle is is

568
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:48,469
a poser another set of challenges right

569
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,869
it shapes from the human to the software

570
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:53,149
to get an input of you know the the

571
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:56,569
situation the vehicle is running and

572
00:34:53,149 --> 00:35:00,500
they have to make a decision in

573
00:34:56,569 --> 00:35:04,009
real-time to to make sure that the

574
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,290
system is driving safely so it puts a

575
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:10,370
lot a lot more security and a robustness

576
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:15,009
requirement requirement on those

577
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:18,859
properties and autonomous vehicles plans

578
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:23,330
traditional automotive electronics with

579
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:27,170
IT society season like devices so the

580
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:29,569
traditional IT traditional vehicle easy

581
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,910
use you can think of there is a embedded

582
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,370
system for the most part it's gotten

583
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,310
limited the computational power and in

584
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:40,460
memory space and the resources that you

585
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:43,930
can run and build security all versus

586
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:48,170
the the other opposite which is the IT

587
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:53,230
you know generally you've got a lot of a

588
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:59,200
lot more resources to work on so how to

589
00:35:53,230 --> 00:36:04,160
how to make sure the the heterogeneous

590
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,470
state of the vehicle and how to have a

591
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,430
sub security solution that accounts for

592
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:14,720
the various difference of the capability

593
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:17,720
of the system is is a challenge and

594
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:23,720
you've got the autonomous vehicle also

595
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:26,779
has lidar which is the light and which

596
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,629
is a light distance and ranging and the

597
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,820
radar the radial distance and

598
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:35,060
rearranging the camera the camera data

599
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:39,890
coming into form of the sensor so it is

600
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:43,070
a lot more infos that the vehicle is is

601
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:46,400
getting and each one will be will have

602
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:50,510
its own characteristic and will it needs

603
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,620
its own cybersecurity solution to secure

604
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:58,190
it so and also that the physical

605
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:00,109
security aspect of the occupant cabin

606
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,140
requires additional cybersecurity

607
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:06,950
measures now you have all the sensors

608
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:09,950
lidar radar cameras is up side of the

609
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:13,250
vehicle and you have to think about how

610
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,370
to make it strong to protect from

611
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,680
tampering compromising physically of the

612
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:21,740
part so those are some of the newer

613
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,339
concerns in automotive in the autonomous

614
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:30,899
driving

615
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:33,540
space okay now is you the skills and

616
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,910
opportunities so our team is of really

617
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:41,430
diverse team and we we've gotten

618
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:44,220
engineers electrical engineers system

619
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:47,960
engineers with cybersecurity backgrounds

620
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:52,830
with cryptography backgrounds and

621
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:57,540
traditional IT backgrounds the security

622
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:59,640
architecture program management Rd and

623
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,580
even hacking as I mentioned in the

624
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,089
beginning so it's a this is just a some

625
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:10,470
examples skills that's that's going to

626
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:13,830
be needed for a successful cyber

627
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:19,319
security engineer for us engineer to be

628
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:23,880
successful now there are there are whole

629
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,730
lot more other skills that will be you

630
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,630
know needed or developed when you are

631
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:34,380
working in this space such as

632
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:36,930
collaborative skills communication

633
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,050
skills et cetera et cetera so which is

634
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:45,629
typical to most of the other jobs as

635
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:50,880
well so we see a lack of the talents in

636
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:54,990
this space and we hope the universities

637
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,140
can do a little more in in the educate

638
00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:01,080
in that education of embedded systems

639
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,650
security of harness automotive we are

640
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:08,370
the motive systems and embedded system

641
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:12,990
security and just promote the

642
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:17,160
understanding of these different systems

643
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:21,569
and prepare the talents to be ready to

644
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:24,690
to get into the workforce so some of our

645
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:29,160
openings are this this is just a you

646
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:32,000
know some of our current openings we

647
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,100
we've got our engineers we need the PM's

648
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,910
program managers we need the researchers

649
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:41,140
and we also have intern

650
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:43,450
shape openings for next a year so if any

651
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,779
of these and the previous of slides if

652
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:50,819
any of those you know interests you

653
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,050
please talk to me and Mike afterwards

654
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,180
we'd like you to would like to

655
00:39:53,050 --> 00:40:07,900
understand a bit better of your interest

656
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:10,089
and your qualifications and so some of

657
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:18,400
the elements the research topic that we

658
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:19,590
are we're doing right now which will

659
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,530
need your help

660
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:27,490
eventually are like remote attestation

661
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,890
which the the back end couldn't know at

662
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,700
any given moment what is their software

663
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,250
that's running on a vehicle is there any

664
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,580
new malware that wasn't supposed to be

665
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:41,350
on a vehicle that is currently present

666
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,259
and by remote attestation

667
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:47,560
we could have detect that but how do we

668
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:51,100
make it more efficient it is essentially

669
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,990
the core issue and intelligent intrusion

670
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,029
detection systems and the intrusion

671
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:59,350
prevention system how do we make it more

672
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:01,600
smart right make it smarter we could use

673
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:07,290
machine learning artificial intelligence

674
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,290
to to be the brain to make a decision

675
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,090
how whether that's an intrusion or not I

676
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,700
mean is monitoring is basically

677
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,610
simulating the brain sometimes the brain

678
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:22,060
can handle things that are fuzzy and

679
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,770
then still make a good decision but it's

680
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:27,060
very difficult difficult for the

681
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:31,270
vehicles or for any anything machine

682
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:35,259
because it it's not as good as the human

683
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:39,610
brain yet cyber forensics higher higher

684
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,590
stress architecture non crudo graphic

685
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:44,860
security solutions such as the physical

686
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:49,750
layer security or using physical

687
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,740
properties to enhance security such as

688
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,619
antigen

689
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:57,430
you can use the power you know

690
00:41:53,619 --> 00:42:00,880
consumption of of a pod where to to tell

691
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:03,160
whether is it has I intended function

692
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,360
embedded into the hardware as a hardware

693
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,520
children or something like that and the

694
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,650
sensor and he spoofing is another thing

695
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,720
that is critical to the autonomous

696
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:18,910
driving autonomous driving vehicles and

697
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,930
applications of potential artificial

698
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:25,118
intelligence into the cybersecurity so

699
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:29,799
I'm pretty much coming to the end of my

700
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:34,210
presentation and oh here are a couple of

701
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:40,960
things so you know this is I hope is

702
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:44,710
your next car we have Chevy this is a

703
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:52,300
little bit off for some reason the

704
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:55,960
picture our Chevy bolt Evie is the first

705
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,710
electrical vehicle that crack to crack

706
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,859
the code of you know affordability

707
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:09,730
together with a 200 mile plus driving

708
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:17,340
range so it's good and our Billick

709
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:23,230
vehicles are GMC trucks and SUVs are

710
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:26,500
Cadillac luxury brand and I want to also

711
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:29,500
talk a little about maven just so it is

712
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,440
estimated that right now there is 15

713
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:36,130
million of people who are using the

714
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,740
right sharing or car sharing and GN

715
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:42,090
basically combined a couple of different

716
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:48,040
programs and made it into a maven brand

717
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:50,520
so this is our brand of sharing and we

718
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,560
are creating a you know half a dozen

719
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,520
personalities probably more than that US

720
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:03,570
cities and we also have prisons in in

721
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,570
Germany in China Brazil and more to come

722
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:10,960
so this shows you the interior of our

723
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:15,160
Cadillac and you can see the 3d you know

724
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,550
map over there and this one as I

725
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:28,500
promised you can see the the apple

726
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:28,500
carplay there and a few more interiors

727
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,720
now it's really the end of my

728
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:42,970
presentation so any questions or

729
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:45,669
comments I'm happy to to take a couple

730
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:48,490
of questions one is when you have these

731
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:53,320
in big thunderstorms how does it affect

732
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:56,160
a capability of GPS communication your

733
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,960
car it does it interrupts it in a way or

734
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:05,850
when you have the big thunderstorms Oh

735
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:08,500
Big O founders yes okay ah well I'm not

736
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:15,190
I'm not expert to answer that question

737
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:17,500
but uh well you can say you are driving

738
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,230
a car all of us and that is some kind of

739
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:23,800
a big thunderstorm and if it is

740
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,840
autonomous basically car it's gonna come

741
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,910
some cause some accident and all of a

742
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,310
sudden basically there's a pileup or

743
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,149
something so that's one concept okay

744
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,860
gotcha

745
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:38,080
yeah so the the cheetah is my

746
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,900
understanding I'm not expert on the GPS

747
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:45,759
but it's my understanding that the GPS

748
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:48,820
now is pretty reliable it can in many

749
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,880
cases it can battle against the bad

750
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:55,750
weather there's one and the vehicle also

751
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,520
has a dead reckoning capability where if

752
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,520
you law for example if you lost the GPS

753
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,850
signal if you don't you know tunnel the

754
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:06,009
vehicle that that reckoning algorithm

755
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:11,319
can still know where your vehicle

756
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:14,620
location is and predict your your your

757
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,260
your trip or your route and also the

758
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:21,940
vehicle has initial what's it called

759
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:26,590
janeshia measurement module i am you

760
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:29,410
which no it has got a zero into it it

761
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:31,270
knows where you are your you know your

762
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:35,140
relative position of the vehicle and

763
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:37,660
things like that so all of these could

764
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,270
help in this duration it is my

765
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:51,100
understanding cursory it's not really my

766
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:53,230
area you do have any qualms to and then

767
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:57,069
basically the location with respect to

768
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,010
the other cars that's one thing that you

769
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,570
wanna basically consider because that's

770
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,890
one thing and the other things I'm

771
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:07,990
concerned about is the amount of these

772
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:10,720
frequencies that have the have they done

773
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:14,020
any studies and how because like the

774
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,209
noise noise noise pollution this is kind

775
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,650
of becoming frequency pollution and

776
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,030
there are some people maybe they have

777
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:21,730
some different device in their bodies

778
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,130
and maybe the other devices and all of a

779
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,110
sudden if there's some disruption or

780
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,450
something do they can't update on

781
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,040
anything on in that regard you are not

782
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:34,270
just a human being because they are also

783
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:37,360
the other animals and maybe we know that

784
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,730
some of these mammals in the sea they

785
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:44,170
get affected by the communications of

786
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:49,060
the basically submarines and some of the

787
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:50,740
other things so after US starts doing

788
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:55,180
General Motors no I'm not saying that I

789
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:56,830
say basically forecasting or basically

790
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,390
being concerned with what's gonna happen

791
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,460
next because you can do everything and

792
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:04,109
all of a sudden you're gonna be in

793
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,700
somewhere that it gets out of control so

794
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:09,580
yeah I know we're very limited on the

795
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:12,250
government tells us what bands of ranges

796
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,779
we can be in I don't know if we've if

797
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,900
you if you know of any areas of where we

798
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:19,390
really tested the limits of that and how

799
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,120
much noise is too much noise I had well

800
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,100
I guess this is kind of about outside of

801
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,520
our area right because you know within

802
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:30,000
GM I you know we definitely they have it

803
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,700
to cover that but I will be happy to you

804
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,840
know write down your questions and you

805
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,799
know get an answer for your offline

806
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,360
they're just things because someone

807
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,710
ideas come to mind when you think about

808
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,520
because there's some of these

809
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:47,010
impeachment for this some concern what's

810
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,600
gonna happen but every is everybody sees

811
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,820
the good thing we're gonna do this and

812
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:57,470
this and that and then all of a sudden

813
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:59,340
this happen mmm-hmm yeah thank you yep I

814
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:03,359
have a question

815
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:06,030
security versus safety trade-off if

816
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,430
let's say to provide integrity with sign

817
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:10,680
messages and we'll use certificates for

818
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,589
parties authentication it will take time

819
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:18,149
to validate certificates to verify

820
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:20,520
signatures and then it imposes overhead

821
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,860
so that the message is delivered with

822
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,380
delay to the mechanism to breaks or to

823
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:28,560
the engine what do you think about that

824
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,900
trade-off my second question about

825
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,930
secure programming techniques which you

826
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,730
use in the company you mentioned that

827
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:38,490
firmware of modern vehicle is more than

828
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:40,950
1 million lines of code then probably

829
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:43,500
use some static analysts static code

830
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:46,169
analysis tools memory protection tools

831
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:50,970
to prevent bugs buffer overflows in that

832
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:53,490
code yeah yeah ok good question so let

833
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:57,720
me try to address the both of them and I

834
00:49:53,490 --> 00:50:00,450
can help so the cyber security and city

835
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,330
is not conflict into each other the

836
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:05,819
cyber security is supporting and

837
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:08,370
supplementing the security part of it

838
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,850
that this the safety part of it we are

839
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:13,799
making the vehicle more secure by

840
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:17,670
leveraging the cyber security mechanisms

841
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,560
so you talk about the signing the

842
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:23,160
certificate and all the things like that

843
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:26,130
which potentially as a little bit of

844
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,879
overhead and potentially as a bit of

845
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:34,080
delay but we are making it in a way in a

846
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,970
way such that it won't cause that huge

847
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,310
delay that will impact the safety

848
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,950
critical systems so there are still

849
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,849
solutions out there

850
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:46,189
no to to make it hamona say work and

851
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:49,099
also for example the the lightweight

852
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,589
cryptographic algorithms you can still

853
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:54,230
make it as strong enough and yet

854
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:57,799
efficient enough and don't cause

855
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:01,400
overhead to potentially influence the

856
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:06,109
safety aspect of it so that's for for

857
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:08,900
the for an extra question oh yeah so so

858
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:10,130
2d what these comment is is we still

859
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,780
were still bound by the same

860
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:13,820
requirements that we were before cyber

861
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,820
security was in the picture just like

862
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,740
you said that message for breaks or

863
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,140
whatever it has to go across the bus it

864
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,328
has to get processed just as fast as it

865
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,549
did before so today's point you know

866
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:28,070
we're adding ready more horsepower and

867
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:31,609
hardware accelerators to do that quick

868
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:33,079
cryptography and still meet the meet the

869
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:34,520
time requirements but we're not

870
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:36,349
adjusting any of our performance

871
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,520
requirements and we're not allowed to

872
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:38,690
adjust any of our performance

873
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,759
requirements just because we're added

874
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,530
security because that will come right

875
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,060
back to us right well you you can't make

876
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,220
our cars work if you're adding the

877
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:50,509
security so we're bound by those

878
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:53,180
requirements still yeah do a second

879
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:55,670
question sure those are some of the best

880
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,890
practices that that's recognized by the

881
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,430
industry and as a matter of fact that

882
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,200
different various entities are

883
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:08,029
suggesting and recommending an issue

884
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:11,379
guidelines such as the SHA 3061 they

885
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:13,940
have the cybersecurity guide books

886
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,710
recommending you have to you know it's

887
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:21,109
recommended that you take the the

888
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:24,980
process is to make the york developers

889
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:28,549
you know a lifecycle secure to implement

890
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:32,599
to utilize static and dynamic dynamic

891
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:34,760
code analysis tools constantly at a code

892
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,740
check check in and then the next day

893
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,339
you're gonna address all the warnings

894
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:43,189
identify the better tools and you know

895
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:47,630
do it next time when you check the in

896
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:50,650
again run the tool so yes those are some

897
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:53,130
of our best practices that are being

898
00:52:50,650 --> 00:53:08,850
employed

899
00:52:53,130 --> 00:53:10,650
yep any other questions sorry so with

900
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,630
devices we have right now I have the

901
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:17,010
privilege of saying do not track my

902
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:19,080
location all right do not do not send

903
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:22,380
out a signal to this particular I can

904
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:25,040
control what what apps can track my

905
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,480
location on what apps can learn what

906
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,700
information about me do you think as

907
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,340
automotives you can afford to give the

908
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,980
user the privilege of saying that for

909
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,570
this duration or on these days I don't

910
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,060
want you to track my location I want to

911
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,710
be offline does that it's that a

912
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,990
privilege you can afford to give the

913
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,180
users or is that something that would

914
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:52,439
contradict with the entire purpose of

915
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:56,419
having an autonomous system I don't know

916
00:53:52,440 --> 00:54:00,450
I have a good answer for that as sort of

917
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:02,550
outside of my expertise so I would have

918
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:07,350
to defer that question to some authority

919
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:09,330
and turn to experts on that because it's

920
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:14,100
it's a it's a messy legal question right

921
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:16,170
but but to opt out anybody can opt out

922
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,819
of OnStar right and I guess I would be

923
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:22,170
the same thing here if you want to opt

924
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:23,970
out of being tracked because of you know

925
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,230
some service at General Motors won't

926
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:28,230
suffice that's fine

927
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,360
where it gets sticky now is our AGM

928
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:33,630
knows that there's a vulnerability out

929
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,640
there and it's attacking vehicles in the

930
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:37,800
greater Seattle area or whatever we're

931
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,500
gonna eventually get to that point what

932
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,300
do we do right if you if we think you

933
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,880
might be over there should we force the

934
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,620
update to you it's a whole legal

935
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,260
discussion now that we're trying to have

936
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:53,430
if you know privacy gets involved and

937
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:57,110
yeah it's it's it's a messy yeah so no

938
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,109
no telling where that's gonna go yet

939
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,129
good question

940
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,890
right

941
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,960
you
