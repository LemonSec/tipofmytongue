1
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,590
we got our next actor technical speaker

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,950
today you had the opportunity to meet

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:27,070
this morning he was awarded our diamond

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,840
award which is again the you think of

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,580
coal when they come in as a student and

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,528
under tons and tons of pressure from

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,399
their faculty they turn into a diamond

8
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:38,380
so jess or was not chose it was chosen

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,730
to be a speaker before we realized that

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,530
he was going to end up being our award

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,910
winner but it worked out to be very nice

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,440
not only did you get here that he's a

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,910
great student but now you get to hear

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,309
some of his great research that he's

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:57,419
done so our next speaker will be uh

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:01:05,259
Desiree oh okay you're in that oh yes

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:07,570
perfect okay I think the goal for

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,420
whoever gives a talk in in the afternoon

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,490
right after lunch is start to keep their

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,520
audience a week that's what I'll try to

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:25,810
do just want the bar back there to get

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:28,390
off okay so first goal try to keep you

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,160
awake second goal give you something

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,640
that is a little bit different from what

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,640
we are used to hear hear we're used to

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,620
very low level how we do code protection

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,260
now we do cyber security in our systems

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,120
what I'm giving you today is something a

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,520
little bit high level a little bit less

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,280
detailed because in dealing with complex

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,110
systems interaction between systems so

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,270
we heard it at all this morning i'm

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,670
boring i'm building an airplane my

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,039
problem is not my jaan achsah curity my

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,650
problem is when the airline chooses

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,370
their entertainment system and I could

37
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,110
have some trouble here so first of all I

38
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,510
will tell you what I'll talk to you

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,750
about this is just an application of

40
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,120
some of my research for my PhD I will

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,180
tell you why we decided to introduce

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,910
this application to cybersecurity and I

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,620
will give you the four slides summary of

44
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,900
what in my dissertation is a hundred

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,480
pages that one of the methods I

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,610
developed during my four and a half

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,410
years here Purdue

48
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,690
is called system operational dependency

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,600
analysis showed up and I will show you

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,220
how we are using this methodology in

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,070
different applications and in particular

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,510
today we will show you how we can use it

53
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,959
to address some of the problem of cyber

54
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,510
securities and then it will give you

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,670
just a quick glance of a second method

56
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,679
that doesn't have a cool acronym is just

57
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,350
system developmental dependency analysis

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,690
as DDA and we should find some better

59
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,079
cranford for this one and then we'll

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,820
draw the conclusions okay let's start

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,560
with complex systems we have a bunch of

62
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,900
systems they are connected together

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,140
there are systems that need it for input

64
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,239
by some other system and we got our nice

65
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,850
happy pirate who is trying to attack our

66
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,420
system now what we can do is basically

67
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,030
two things the first is reducing or

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,190
containing the attacks so trying to

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,880
block people outside our systems or

70
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,410
trying to destroy their tools would

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,209
widget are attacking so make them

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,810
unhappy this is done mostly at the level

73
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,269
of individual systems and this is what

74
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,180
we are good enough we're quite good at

75
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,180
doing it right now now we got another

76
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:47,220
problem we have to reduce the impact of

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:51,760
attacks that go through the so-called

78
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,950
interstitials we have to try to reduce

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,480
the attacks that do not affect affect

80
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,619
directly a system but that either be

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,200
attacked to some connection between

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,989
systems or they can be attacked to an

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,298
individual system that don't cause a

84
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,850
huge trouble in that system but then

85
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:13,840
they cause a cascading effect that may

86
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,120
have higher impact that we imagine so

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,548
the first step we need to do for this

88
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,280
second part reduce the impact of attacks

89
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,979
as we need to analyze this impact and

90
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,270
assess what is the risk of this kind of

91
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:32,560
attacks and for this classification I

92
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:35,409
use at all by Powell 2010 he classified

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,750
three effects of cyber attacks the

94
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,460
primary effect is direct disruption of

95
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,560
an individual system under attack

96
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,530
the secondary which you call secondary

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,810
or internal effect is the disruption of

98
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,900
services that were provided by the

99
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,420
system under attack and then there's a

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,469
tertiary effect that is the cascading

101
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,030
impact on a probability of other systems

102
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,250
so what it means is that in a complex

103
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,090
system and actually it happens every day

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,810
we can accept some attacks if they do

105
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,010
not cause too much disruptions and what

106
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,880
I'm trying to do with this application

107
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:18,810
is quantify what it means too much and

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:23,400
how can we actually compute and quantify

109
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:25,380
what is this impact tertiary impact so

110
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,830
our goal and supporting cyber security

111
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:33,090
complex systems and system of systems is

112
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:36,419
addressing this tertiary effects this

113
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,010
tertiary effects come out of three I

114
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,800
don't think you can see it in the back

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,320
so I will read it out three features of

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,770
complex systems operational dependencies

117
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,330
between the systems we're dealing with

118
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,880
complex overall behavior that is not

119
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,620
easy to understand sometimes there is

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,409
some propagation or some propagating

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,390
effect that we didn't even consider that

122
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,330
is due to some emergence behavior in our

123
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,820
complex systems so we need to also

124
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,820
analyzed with our disco skating effects

125
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,820
we need to keep in mind that securing

126
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,820
our individual components or individual

127
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,640
systems does not guarantee that the

128
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,520
overall system will be secure and this

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,229
is a step that working with decision to

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,599
me was quite obvious when I talk to

131
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,430
practitioners they always had in mind

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,920
okay if I secure all my individual

133
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:34,650
systems everything will work fine wrong

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,650
so let's switch to some little more

135
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,830
technical talk about soda this is the

136
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,729
first of the four summary slides soda is

137
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,260
a parametric model of system behavior it

138
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,050
all starts back from simple linear

139
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,650
economic models trying to match input

140
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,270
and outputs and see how our outputs

141
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,370
behave when the inputs chain

142
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,070
change and then this simple linear model

143
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,490
course could not model accurately enough

144
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,590
some complex operational dependencies so

145
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,040
other people hames and then Garvin

146
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,840
printer and mitre develop some more

147
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,360
complex model based on two parameters

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,039
and in particular Garvin pin to develop

149
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,550
this functional dependency network

150
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,430
analysis tool then measure and quantify

151
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,120
the dependencies reading capabilities

152
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,240
that we wanted to achieve starting from

153
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,950
this method I ran a lot of experiments

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,170
since as you heard this morning I have a

155
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,849
lot of trouble getting data my research

156
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,310
is funded by Department of Defense

157
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,280
they're giving me money but not data and

158
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,380
i will like both of them of course they

159
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,590
cannot because of my of my citizenship

160
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,170
and the same is when we've been put in

161
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,869
contact with mitre the Navy the Army

162
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,930
Research Lab and NASA and of course they

163
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,760
always have trouble with data so what

164
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,530
they ask me is either I teach them how

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,659
to use my methods and they use them or I

166
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,070
have to make up my data so what I did is

167
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,810
I ran a lot of simulations for various

168
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,170
for various applications that would that

169
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:13,650
we build I built agent based models I

170
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:17,010
ran some experiments to determine how

171
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:21,780
good where this parametric models and

172
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,880
they were good but not really awesome

173
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,559
they couldn't model some behavior that

174
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,610
instead I would have really loved to you

175
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,350
for example when there's some dependence

176
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,460
you can imagine input output is almost

177
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,170
stepwise so if we have some input we get

178
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,110
almost no output and all of a sudden we

179
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,059
get quite a good output this parametric

180
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,280
models could not capture that behavior

181
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,910
this course traveled because when we got

182
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,230
results in our soda model they were very

183
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,680
different from what we saw in the

184
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,890
agent-based model so what I did was

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,969
improving it adding a third parameter

186
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,770
adding something that represents the

187
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,350
internal status of the systems we are

188
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:05,040
considering and India and as we'll see

189
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,840
in next slides I achieve a quite good

190
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,189
model that can give some information for

191
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,990
high-level Ark

192
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,520
petrol decision what we're trying to do

193
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,280
with this with this tool is identifying

194
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,069
how I can put my systems together in a

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,380
feasible way that is also robust robust

196
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,840
enough to allow me to achieve a certain

197
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,590
threshold of ability even when I'm under

198
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,260
attack we can identify what are the

199
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,060
critical it is and besides that we can

200
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,980
identify what are the reasons of the

201
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,979
behavior will serve that is something

202
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,630
that for example surfers response

203
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,670
methodology do not give us they give

204
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,760
very good models but they do not tell us

205
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,810
why this systems behave the way I

206
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,150
observe so by using this method after we

207
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,520
identify this criticality identify why

208
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,319
something happens we can discard flawed

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,670
architectures and improve the

210
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,750
architectures that are already working

211
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:04,949
in a good way I will save you the math

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,050
that's behind it the simple points that

213
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,710
I want you to take out of how soda works

214
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,260
is that we have a normalized concept of

215
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,720
internal status is just a percentage how

216
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,490
well my system is working is it giving

217
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,620
me forty percent of its capabilities you

218
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,170
give me a hundred percent eighty percent

219
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,600
of course this number will be related to

220
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,969
some physical property and some of my

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,660
applications for example is probability

222
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,830
of correct radar detection or

223
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,640
probability system gives enough

224
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,940
bandwidth and so on based on these

225
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,220
internal status we go and see what is

226
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,490
the output so based on the operability

227
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,070
of the system I we're going to see how

228
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,170
the operability of cmj behaves and of

229
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,560
course system j as its internal status

230
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:57,290
but then part of its final output will

231
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,030
depend on what system is passing in and

232
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm sorry sure we have this piecewise

233
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,530
linear input-output behavior that's the

234
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,319
minimum of these two curves so identify

235
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:11,310
that most systems can be modeled with an

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,680
area that we call s.o.d zone a sense for

237
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,439
strength of dependency that is an area

238
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,719
where when the operability an input

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,120
decreases the probability an output

240
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,960
decreases but not so much you can still

241
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,330
be

242
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,040
above some acceptable threshold and then

243
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,100
we got a critical area when we start

244
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,400
getting very low inputs when we got very

245
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,400
high disruption in system I or somewhere

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,850
in the interstitial then we have a huge

247
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,650
loss so we quantify this model with

248
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,260
these three parameters usually we get

249
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,970
them from simulation where if we don't

250
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,650
have even simulation we can use expert

251
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,810
opinion that I would just leave as the

252
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,380
final resource it would be better to

253
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,119
have historical experimental data so if

254
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,310
I'll ever have seasoned ship at some

255
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,850
point maybe I will be able to get this

256
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:03,060
data of course this is just a single

257
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,900
dependency see semi to system j can

258
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,300
become more complex this is just a

259
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:12,030
dependency of detection capability from

260
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,099
helicopter readership raider the blue

261
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,350
dots are the results of the experiments

262
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,890
from the agent-based model simulation

263
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,590
that's quite detailed this fit was the

264
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,770
old two parameters f DNA model and you

265
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,620
can see wasn't a good representation in

266
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:32,850
some points this fit on the riot is a

267
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,890
soda model three parameters and i want

268
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,990
to underline again that we accept to

269
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,420
lose a little bit of detail with what

270
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,240
happens in real life but we have

271
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,650
parameters that have some physical

272
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,290
meaning the parameters are telling me

273
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,439
how critical is this dependency how

274
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:55,550
strong is this dependency how wide is my

275
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:59,490
critical zone the final slide for soda

276
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,109
quick three steps of how we apply it in

277
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,540
our complex system we identify what are

278
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,330
the operation on dependencies this also

279
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,849
means that those parameters and those

280
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,220
number that we call operability and self

281
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,680
effect in s or internal status will have

282
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,260
a physical meaning so we are exactly

283
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,030
telling what is internal status of sls

284
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,880
what is internal status of Orion capsule

285
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:25,800
and what this errors mean what do I need

286
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,080
for this operational dependency between

287
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,180
spacecraft and what do what is the

288
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,040
operational dependency of achieving my

289
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,290
mission to Mars upon this systems

290
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,509
then if we have historical data if we

291
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,269
have experiments of whatever is the

292
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,769
source we identify the parameters the

293
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,620
represents they represent these

294
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:50,190
dependencies at this point we can run

295
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,720
our soda analysis it can be and we'll

296
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,480
see later some application can be

297
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,949
deterministic single point we decide

298
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,110
what are the failures or what is the

299
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:01,349
current opera Billy's status of each

300
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,149
system and we measure what would be the

301
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,940
cascading effect on the probability of

302
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,170
all the other systems until finding out

303
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,920
the numbers we are interesting for

304
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:13,170
example with how much percentage I

305
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,479
achieved my capability of executing this

306
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,719
mission to Mars or it can be some

307
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:23,040
stochastic analysis like this plot you

308
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,860
can see here I just assign probability

309
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,170
distributions to the operability of each

310
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,120
of this node so their internal status

311
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,370
somebody tells me this is a very robust

312
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,899
system this is in Nora bus this is a

313
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,630
system of which we don't know anything

314
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,600
use a uniform distribution and what I

315
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,279
measure is probability density function

316
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,029
of her abilities of all the other

317
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,370
systems what will my final system 5 do

318
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:53,490
what will be the expected value out of

319
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:57,389
it what do we do to apply it to cyber

320
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,269
security first of all system that is

321
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:03,120
working correctly and we imagine this

322
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,389
simple 3 node Network our errors are

323
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,889
just communication links so the

324
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,040
probability dependency is just

325
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:14,220
communication bands and this case I

326
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,130
assumed that it was the verbally was

327
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,199
number of packets per second that

328
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,630
arrived correctly at destination

329
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,750
everything is working internal status of

330
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,220
decisions one hundred percent each one

331
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,600
of the dependencies and we'll see one

332
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,389
hundred percent of the required input we

333
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,990
can have an attack to one system that

334
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:38,610
system will be disrupted and we have the

335
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,279
world I called secondary effect a

336
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,130
internal affect the service given by

337
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,160
that system is now in it not anymore one

338
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,480
hundred percent it's seventy percent and

339
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,790
of course both the dependent system

340
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,410
we'll see this seventy percent of the

341
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,329
required input or something can happen

342
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,420
at the interstitial it can be disruption

343
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,790
it can be an attack and the result is

344
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,279
that this system will still have its

345
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,529
hundred percent of our ability but then

346
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,240
it won't be able to communicate the

347
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,850
required input for example in this one

348
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,110
ok band so once this and we'll see the

349
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,740
hundred percent of the required input

350
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,160
the other will see on fifty percent now

351
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,670
the question is is this good enough and

352
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,219
if it's not where do we want to act do

353
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,420
we want to improve their busness here do

354
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,519
we want to improve the robustness of

355
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,769
this individual system do we want to

356
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,269
change our architecture completely and

357
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,350
these are some of the questions that I

358
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:45,240
trying to answer and are there any

359
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:45,240
questions preliminary questions sure

360
00:16:51,329 --> 00:17:03,209
yes I'm not generating data from that

361
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,529
model i'm using the model to analyze i'm

362
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,198
generating data from an agent-based

363
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:10,439
model so engineering the blue dots

364
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,329
you've seen its independent the

365
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,100
piecewise linear model is what I used to

366
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,279
model the results that I would see in

367
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,559
real life or from simulation and I use

368
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:27,359
the simplified model to analyze and get

369
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:29,070
results yes correct okay i will show you

370
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,340
this simple example it's a very small

371
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,549
network I got something for NASA that

372
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,709
has 300 notes and it's really hard to

373
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:41,158
follow so I will go with the simple five

374
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,380
notes analysis one control center two

375
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:44,639
satellites a UAV a carrier that needs

376
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,690
some information from one of the

377
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:52,019
satellites and UAV to perform its task

378
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,970
this is a part small part of a naval

379
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,200
warfare scenario which will see a larger

380
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,600
Network later I ran some reduced number

381
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,679
of simulations here of course we don't

382
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,959
want to spend too much time in

383
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,539
simulation otherwise this model would be

384
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,029
useless so it did some design your

385
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:12,149
experiment run a few simulation feed the

386
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:13,830
data and these are the three parameters

387
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:16,439
for each of this dependency strength

388
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,350
criticality and impact that tells us how

389
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,500
wide the critical zone is so for each of

390
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,570
this dependencies we can see what is the

391
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,019
direct impact on the immediately

392
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,289
following system first kind of analysis

393
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:33,330
side there is a simple deterministic

394
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,510
analysis let's assume that each one of

395
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,418
the system can fail one at a time and

396
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,399
they go down to twenty-five percent of

397
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,010
their internet status so let's see what

398
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,418
happens if the control center is not

399
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,460
working at twenty-five percent of its

400
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,909
super ability and in this case it's

401
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,700
still the meaning of a probability in

402
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:58,860
this application was again information

403
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,539
transmitted to the following systems

404
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,830
what happens if the operability of the

405
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,929
satellite number to decrease

406
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,309
twenty-five percent and so on and our

407
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,799
measure of merit or measure of

408
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:14,340
performance in this case is how well is

409
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,980
the carrier performing and we could see

410
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,769
that actually if the carrier itself was

411
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:23,460
disrupted somehow either by failure or

412
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:25,409
by attack in the end it was supported so

413
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,690
much like it so probability depended so

414
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:30,659
much on previous system that even if the

415
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,870
internal system of the carrier lost 75

416
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,760
percent in the end the final operability

417
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,580
of the carrier lost only fifteen percent

418
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,220
so what we identified is actually given

419
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,490
this topology are most critical systems

420
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,750
we're number one and number four so the

421
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:53,850
control center and this one satellite of

422
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,230
course we get we can get the same in the

423
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,090
case of cyberattacks if the attack is

424
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,149
not directed to a system but to a

425
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,678
communication channel so we got so in

426
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:06,120
this case I would assume let this

427
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,950
rupture and more give attack the

428
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,989
determinate analysis is the same as for

429
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,480
attack to the nodes we got a disrupted

430
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,260
link that means the system is working

431
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,279
correctly but then its output goes along

432
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,440
the link number 2 and link number 3 but

433
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,389
along link number 1 only twenty-five

434
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,330
percent of the required output is

435
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,918
received by this satellite and again we

436
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,678
can identify what are the most critical

437
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,149
links in this case the last two so the

438
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,090
links that bring the final communication

439
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:38,489
to the carrier and their critical even

440
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,980
if you think that here they're failing

441
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,080
one at a time so it means that we still

442
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,179
achieve communication on one of the two

443
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,309
channels but still lose almost thirty

444
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:54,179
percent of the final operability little

445
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,010
bit better we can have a more thorough

446
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,320
understanding or what actually happens

447
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,649
in this topology if instead of focusing

448
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,860
on a single case we have some tribution

449
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:07,649
for example in this case we have

450
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:10,830
internal status of regular systems as a

451
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:13,500
beta distribution shifted to the right

452
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,850
so there are system they usually work

453
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,360
around eighty ninety percent of their

454
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,000
maximum capable

455
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,260
and my disrupted system in this case

456
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,480
instead then going down to a single

457
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,680
number twenty-five percent follows a

458
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,540
beta distribution this is a beta 2 11

459
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,250
for who is familiar with with beta

460
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,590
distributions so it's just the

461
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,680
probability that the internal status of

462
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:42,330
my disrupted system will have this value

463
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,830
I ran the same analysis as before except

464
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,960
and in this case we're running a hundred

465
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,360
thousand cases every time we simulate

466
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,170
the probably distribution and the

467
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,330
outcome is a probability distribution

468
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:58,010
for the operability of interest so in

469
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,659
this case where the first node the

470
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,490
control center following this

471
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,590
distribution for internal status and

472
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,340
every other system in the network

473
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,929
working correctly this was the final

474
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:15,949
distribution for the operability of the

475
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:18,690
carrier and you can see actually all the

476
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,910
the case of the final variability is

477
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,160
always lower we always have more loss

478
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,480
than we had in the previous case because

479
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,130
in the previous case when we go down to

480
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,830
twenty-five percent we almost never

481
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,080
reach the critical zone we almost never

482
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,610
reach the area when actually our loss

483
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,389
you know variability is a lot higher

484
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,830
here instead we have many cases almost

485
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,370
fifty percent of the case i think the

486
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,530
median is here that are between 0 and

487
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,449
twenty percent of the internal status

488
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,600
for each of these systems when there is

489
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,220
interruption so we can see that now note

490
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,129
one is always critical as it was before

491
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,780
but now even note 3 that's the other

492
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,580
satellite and even the carrier itself

493
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,710
are critical systems in this network we

494
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,320
do we can do the same with the links so

495
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,540
classic analysis and again here the

496
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,300
links the final links to the carrier

497
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:12,030
where the most critical and again we see

498
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,790
that all links are now more critical

499
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:18,480
than they appear to be by doing a single

500
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:20,520
point analysis now what do we do with

501
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,460
this data i will show you with this

502
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,870
slightly larger scenario and you can see

503
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,660
again that we are working a very high

504
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,389
level this analysis can also be done a

505
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,250
lower level i also did at the level of

506
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,050
individual subsystems you want to

507
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,990
complex system just the network becomes

508
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,480
larger since the model is piecewise

509
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,480
linear is actually very fast so I had

510
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,050
network with 1 million nodes and 250,000

511
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,610
links and I got the results in 25

512
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:52,050
seconds so it's quite fast so this was

513
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,479
an application for Department of Defense

514
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,360
novel war first scenario system of

515
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,830
systems we had our systems helicopter

516
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,560
mh-60 le copters boats UAVs and surface

517
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,990
vehicles divided in groups that had

518
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,260
different tasks and the tasks were

519
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,970
performing recon of Mayan summaries and

520
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,470
enemy boats and then engaging the enemy

521
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,420
some of the systems had actually two

522
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,110
tasks they spend ninety percent of the

523
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:25,740
time doing recon and ten percent also

524
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:28,620
engaging the enemy first step after

525
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,860
defining what this links and and again

526
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,540
they were just for the Raiders

527
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,669
probability of detecting the enemy when

528
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,800
it's within the range and for the weapon

529
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,290
system probability of engaging the enemy

530
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:44,790
we needs within the range I convert it

531
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:47,330
to this soda network topology so now I'm

532
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:51,180
interesting systems and subsystems when

533
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:54,870
when one of the ship had double task so

534
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,490
part recon heart attack and then I added

535
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,080
these notes that just represent our

536
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,230
capabilities that we're interested

537
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,760
quantify it is recon the enemy bills the

538
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,890
enemy mines the enemy submarine and

539
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,960
engage the enemy mine spells and

540
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,870
submarines and they also had another

541
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,940
topology that actually another network

542
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,520
that was embedded in this one but I just

543
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,460
bleed into you or for clarity these are

544
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,110
the communication links so when I do

545
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,590
recon I have to communicate to some

546
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:27,030
other system this is where the enemy is

547
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:28,439
going gauge the enemy I ran various

548
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,930
scenarios this is one of the

549
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,040
applications when it just speak three

550
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:37,440
links and again I perform simple that in

551
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,409
music and all is a single point there is

552
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,800
some attack on this specific channels or

553
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,430
de specific communication links number

554
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
one two and three

555
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:52,500
and again I look at the secondary effect

556
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:57,909
so how much the directly affected system

557
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:59,890
lost in capability but would watch the

558
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,670
variation in the capability of engaging

559
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:06,820
the enemy so if I have a failure in link

560
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,830
number one the shape of my Surface

561
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,649
Warfare group lost thirty five percent

562
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,710
of its capability but since it was

563
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,940
embedded in this group in the end I lost

564
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,190
only eight point seventy five percent

565
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,500
capability of engaging the enemies on

566
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,740
the surface so this can still be

567
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,350
acceptable my Admiral general whoever

568
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,290
will tell me if it's acceptable and of

569
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,600
course as we did a conversion from

570
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,190
performance to this normalized measure

571
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,860
of our ability we can also do the

572
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,060
inverse operation and I can tell then in

573
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,330
this case eight point seventy five

574
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:44,560
percent means this much delay in terms

575
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,270
of time in engaging the enemy something

576
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,210
that might not be acceptable is for

577
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,040
example if we lose link number 3 we have

578
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,570
only one sis seminary copped a

579
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,000
helicopter that can engage the enemy

580
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:58,120
submarine if we lose this communication

581
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
will lose forty-five percent of our

582
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,030
capability here that also will translate

583
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,270
into forty-five percent loss and our

584
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,160
capability to engage somewhere in and of

585
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,590
course in this simple cases obvious the

586
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,320
reason why because we have this one

587
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,990
system performing this task in more

588
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,050
complex system actually have to go and

589
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:22,510
look at cascading effect and find a with

590
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,340
the parameters I can find a path that

591
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,980
tells me this is the path of high

592
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,800
criticality high strength and this is

593
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,430
the reason why this system is critical

594
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,889
now that we know why we can decide what

595
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,260
to do in this case is simple improve the

596
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,880
anti-submarine subsystem since the

597
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,420
problem was the fact that we had only

598
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,090
one system performing the task but we

599
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:49,450
also know that here we have a ship that

600
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:52,209
can do reconnaissance of submarines just

601
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,550
let's just this ship help so we have a

602
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:59,180
different topology where this chip can

603
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:01,879
also recount submarines and communicate

604
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,790
and what happens is just with still loss

605
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,320
here or forty-five percent but with this

606
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:13,370
help our final capability of the entire

607
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,700
submarine reconnaissance group increases

608
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,469
and we lose only twenty-five percent of

609
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,780
course again this is simple example I

610
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:26,150
got more complex applications in the

611
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:30,080
papers in backup slides so this is all i

612
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:33,110
have for soda today second step really

613
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,169
quick last three slides what i did with

614
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,899
SD da so at some point somebody asks us

615
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:41,540
why don't you use this concept of

616
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,930
operational dependencies even in a

617
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,930
developmental domain so based on the

618
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:50,240
same ideas in this case my parameters do

619
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,980
not represent operability dependencies

620
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,710
but operational dependencies but they

621
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,080
represent developmental dependencies how

622
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,910
much the development of various systems

623
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,070
can be overlapped how much they are

624
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:04,340
independent from each other and what is

625
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,830
the cascading effect of some delay in

626
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,530
developing this system of course in

627
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,689
simple pert networks we just have this I

628
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,430
guess most of you are familiar with /

629
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,470
techniques we have this absolute

630
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,050
dependencies I need to wait until the

631
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,910
system is fully developed and deployed

632
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,980
to start the development of my other

633
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,050
systems when we have multiple

634
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,390
stakeholder stakeholders and we are

635
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,370
talking about complex system this is not

636
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,550
the case we might have some partial

637
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:34,250
overlapping and we have to decide how

638
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:37,220
much we want to begin the development of

639
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,170
a system before some other system is

640
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,700
fully developed there is some risk

641
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,070
associated because I can spur my

642
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,690
development my other stakeholder tells

643
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:47,030
me these are the data you can based upon

644
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,010
but at some point they would say oh you

645
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,670
know what I'm not giving you the system

646
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,410
anymore or I will have two years delay

647
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:57,140
how does this impact what we're doing

648
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,440
and how do we use this together with

649
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:05,540
soda to decide topologies that are more

650
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,850
robust towards attacks I will skip the

651
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,490
model it just say how much we can start

652
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,590
ahead of time our development what's

653
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,920
important is some application for

654
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,199
example

655
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,540
in this case I had three different

656
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,940
developmental architectures called AB&C

657
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,740
that were still for the Naval Warfare

658
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,470
scenario system I just decided to

659
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,160
develop my empty submarine anti-surface

660
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,260
anti-mine systems at different times so

661
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,720
the first thing I have is my capability

662
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,100
my operability of the technique and

663
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,230
engaging the enemy is growing over time

664
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,290
because I'm deploying more and more

665
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:42,130
systems but at some point I might have

666
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,810
some disruption of or some attack or

667
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,540
just some stakeholder deciding that they

668
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:49,840
won't give me their system anymore first

669
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,899
thing we can measure is how much our

670
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,870
architecture is robust can you recover

671
00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:00,760
architecture see is the more robust

672
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:04,729
simply the risk we had accepted was less

673
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,560
we had deployed some system later so we

674
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:10,520
achieved less capability at some point

675
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,580
less than the architecture biore but

676
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,860
since we had this later deployment we

677
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,760
also had more flexibility that means

678
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,020
when there was this attack or disruption

679
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,990
architecture see was the best was the

680
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,910
more robust or we can have resilience

681
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,700
capability to recover part of this

682
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,200
variability think of the of the example

683
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,660
I gave before when one system could

684
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,790
replace another so in this case what we

685
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,420
saw is that instead architectures B and

686
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:40,190
C were better at recovering we already

687
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,720
had some system deployed but they had

688
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,360
some rule by which they could replace

689
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,190
each other and they still could perform

690
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,709
well so what we're doing here is trying

691
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,900
to use together the operational domain

692
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,850
the developmental domain and again the

693
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,950
goal is identified what architectures

694
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,530
are better in terms of robustness and

695
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,900
resilience against the tertiary effect

696
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,200
and one to underline again this does not

697
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,820
replace any concept of security within a

698
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,950
single system as you can see something

699
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:11,149
that we need to add to security in

700
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:14,030
individual systems conclusion I show you

701
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:17,380
this soda tool is a dependency analysis

702
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:19,610
tool is a parametric model of behavior

703
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,220
we're using in separate in cyber

704
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,990
security application to represent the

705
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,659
tertiary effect that is the cascading

706
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:30,139
effect of disruption and attacks

707
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:32,059
on systems I show you how great we can

708
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:34,609
identify critical system critical links

709
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,979
stochastic analysis takes longer battle

710
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:40,399
course gives more information and we can

711
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:42,710
at this point do some educated analysis

712
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,299
and educated change in the topology of

713
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,679
our networks the software the current

714
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,080
version of the software the source is

715
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,909
still an academic version is not fully

716
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,428
complete but it's available for free on

717
00:32:52,909 --> 00:33:01,700
nanohub RG is pre-owned produced student

718
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:04,220
and member faculty and staff can just

719
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,049
access with their credentials everybody

720
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,539
can create a free account on nanohub and

721
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:11,809
use these tools there is also manuals

722
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:13,989
and everything in there are there any

723
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:16,789
questions or is there time for question

724
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:19,629
we're at a time thank you very much yes

725
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:19,629
ray thank you
