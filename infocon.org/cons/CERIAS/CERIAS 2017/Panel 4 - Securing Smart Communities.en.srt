1
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:10,629
okay this panel wins the record for the

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,510
quickest set of time the entire

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,030
symposium I point that out you guys are

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,770
good so anyway it's my pleasure to

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,250
introduce our panel moderator for the

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,990
the secure smart communities panel

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,310
discussion and so I'd like to introduce

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,189
professor Richard Boyle

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,930
he's with Purdue Polytech and he'll I

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,320
introduced his panel and take it from

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,480
there

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,120
all right well what a great two days has

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,089
been everyone having a good time I hope

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,739
this has been all right excited students

15
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:44,140
that is great with great students

16
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:47,260
excited faculty we have excited

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,199
corporate sponsors and partners I think

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,579
this is great lots of cool things being

19
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:56,138
being explored and described some of it

20
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,839
a little scary really when you think

21
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:01,030
about it right that you know the

22
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,059
vulnerabilities we're discussing and the

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,840
research and projects on addressing

24
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:10,690
those vulnerabilities but you know that

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
is you know wouldn't be worth it or we

26
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,380
wouldn't do it if we didn't think it was

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,780
worth it right because that's the

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,520
advance of society and that's what in

29
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,120
technology right and that also is what

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,890
you know is the risk right of

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,110
interconnectedness we're social animals

32
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,770
the original Trojan horse was a gift

33
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,890
right between connected societies and

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,170
and so you know it's no different in the

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,700
progress of we may think oh wow there

36
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,110
are a lot of vulnerabilities with all

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,930
this private you know we have privacy

38
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,800
risks now and and outright security

39
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:50,950
risks and you know we could say the same

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,410
thing about the risks of a high-speed

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,510
crash in a car right when we had horses

42
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,759
we didn't have too many of those okay

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,430
but we died because it took six weeks or

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,690
eight weeks to get across the country

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,880
instead of just a couple hours right

46
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,370
that's part of the trade-offs we do and

47
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,049
likewise with our interconnected devices

48
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:14,650
the net gain we feel is worth it right

49
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,550
and yet we have to build safety into

50
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,640
these problems right

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,750
and that's what I just came back from a

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,750
rotation at OSTP at the white house in

53
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,700
BC and and that was kind of my role I

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,500
was a technical guy right

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:37,310
I was the robotics and and IOT guru for

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,500
the White House but oFPP is about policy

57
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,810
right it's about how technology affects

58
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,320
policy and birth vice versa how policy

59
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,520
affects technology and so my role wasn't

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,440
designing the microprocessors and the

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,630
algorithms and and playing with the fun

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,390
gadgets it was trying to get people

63
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,030
together to ask those questions what is

64
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,429
the right trade-off what are the

65
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,110
economic benefits that are going to

66
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,890
result from greater interconnectedness

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:06,340
and yet how do we you know interconnect

68
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,369
in this you know brings in

69
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,770
vulnerabilities and it's explaining to

70
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,270
two technical people to non-technical

71
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,580
people to make sure that the right

72
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,710
parties are at the table to get these

73
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,440
things airs and I think our panel is a

74
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,060
nice diverse excellent panel for exactly

75
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,030
that you know some of the things we

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,140
dealt with in my role in smart cities

77
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,600
and in robotics

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,570
you know the FAA came into this and

79
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,829
grown rules right and and and some

80
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,410
people would just come in and say well

81
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,160
look we just need to make sure that

82
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,190
every drone has an ID okay and it's kind

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,020
of my role to say well but the best auto

84
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,500
pilots in the world right now are in the

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:51,830
open source and so if we for software on

86
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,770
a drone so we can ensure privacy we can

87
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,480
ensure security well people will just

88
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,160
pull out the software and put in their

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,709
own because it's just as good and maybe

90
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,530
better and then they say well we'll just

91
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,380
lock down the CPU can't we do that well

92
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,200
no because the best auto pilots in the

93
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,350
world run on little cheap arduino 'he's

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,570
right they're not military systems and

95
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,589
so they'll just pull out the cpu and put

96
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,120
in their own oh well then maybe

97
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:24,650
open-source is the problem that's the

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,730
security threat well you know yes if you

99
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,609
don't design your defenses

100
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:34,220
properly right it's that trade-off that

101
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:39,030
makes this both scary and exciting right

102
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,190
and that is the nature I think of what

103
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,289
we're talking about here and and why

104
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,460
this has been a good day and here we are

105
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,110
at the end of the second day and we

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,599
still have a full room is awesome okay

107
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:54,780
thank you so what I'm going to do is let

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,580
our panelists introduce themselves I'm

109
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,869
just going to go down the list because

110
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,400
we have some great people and we're

111
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,260
going to have them tell you what they do

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,570
okay and then we're going to open it up

113
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,930
for questions and welcome your

114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,250
involvement in this panel so Bob let's

115
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:18,990
if you could give us your take on

116
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:21,930
yourself well I was a NSA spent 26 years

117
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,850
and as a director of network security at

118
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,300
NSA and ultimately went to the Pentagon

119
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,720
and became the deputy assistant

120
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,670
secretary for cyber security there and

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:37,290
supported three presidents while I was

122
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:41,430
there and retired after the first year

123
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:44,250
of the Obama administration and you know

124
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,860
I have had been extremely passionate

125
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,670
about many things in my era in cyber

126
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:55,200
security so probably the most passionate

127
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:58,560
thing before this issue that we're

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,719
talking about this afternoon was helping

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,020
to bring the the department defense and

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,100
ultimately the US government into a

131
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:11,039
strategy of leveraging the internet for

132
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,460
defensive purposes because the DoD was

133
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,830
stuck in the dark ages and and we

134
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,469
realized back in the 1990s that we

135
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,919
needed to to move the military to be

136
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,680
effective globally as a power not only

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,460
for wartime but for peacetime we needed

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
to be able to leverage the Internet and

139
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,460
it was a very very difficult cultural

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,770
issue in those days as you can imagine

141
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,560
but we got it done especially with the

142
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,080
unfortunate situation with 9/11

143
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,820
the resources were there the biggest

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:51,900
mistake we made in 2001 when we formed

145
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,030
our strategy with the White House is and

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,859
everybody to this day was involved in it

147
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:01,280
where we get together we'll look back is

148
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:04,110
that security was not a major priority

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,929
and as a security guy I was not very

150
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:11,730
happy about that but the goal of the DoD

151
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,560
at that time was to get connectivity get

152
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,050
content out there right away get a

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,780
buy-in from the troops and the war

154
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,860
fighters and let security catch up

155
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,760
that would be attitude and of course

156
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,450
here we are almost two decades later and

157
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,940
we're at a similar crossroads and that

158
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,700
crossroads is in large measure what this

159
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:39,260
panel was talking about which is how do

160
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,919
we leverage IOT for the betterment of

161
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,050
not only this country but the globe and

162
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,270
and I'm extremely passionate about one

163
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,360
thing is I'm not going to let us make

164
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,450
the same mistake we did in 2000 which is

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,830
not to make security of core element of

166
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:02,940
the strategy I'm determined to fall as

167
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:06,780
much as I can on my sword to ensure we

168
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,050
don't make that mistake I was on the

169
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,039
President's Commission for the past year

170
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,410
and we fortunately got IOT and

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,000
cyber-physical written in the

172
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,910
recommendations to whoever the president

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,530
was going to be and I've confident that

174
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,979
Congress and the White House is

175
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:29,419
aggressively trying to deal with it but

176
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,699
I'm only confident to the point where

177
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:37,110
oftentimes functionality off often wins

178
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:40,740
over security but I will tell you that

179
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,140
back in 2000 when we implemented the

180
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,360
net-centric strategy for the DoD in the

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,160
ultimately the US government we really

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,510
didn't have a lot of security solutions

183
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,630
in place so the reality is we only could

184
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,540
have gone so far but I really

185
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,630
feel right now more than ever that we

186
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,900
have in front of us some unbelievable

187
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,060
technologies to allow us to deal with

188
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,370
smart cities to elect to allow us to

189
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,930
deal with security to the point where we

190
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,880
can beat these adversaries and but we've

191
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,430
got to work together as the previous

192
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,980
fireside chat panel talked about to make

193
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,620
this happen I'm extremely proud of the

194
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,950
fact that right here in this university

195
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,330
some of the brightest minds and Purdue

196
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,840
in the center of academic excellence

197
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,370
here and put their thoughts together and

198
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,740
have come up with some phenomenal

199
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,920
technology that I believe will be the

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,250
building block for smart cities and IOT

201
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,170
in general I believe will be a lynchpin

202
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,330
of where we're going to where we're

203
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,390
going to move and that is the hardware

204
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,600
root of trust and identity security

205
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:54,960
built in to the to the core fabric of

206
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,790
IOT and we can go into great detail what

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,550
that means we've got phenomenal people

208
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,290
here and Purdue that I think are going

209
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,410
to revolutionize where we're going to go

210
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,420
and I think this is going to be a step

211
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,980
that's going to change everything a lot

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,760
of what we've even talked about the past

213
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:15,060
few days will be dealt with aggressively

214
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,420
if this technology gets invested and

215
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:21,839
adopted and I am determined to make sure

216
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,819
the US government at least puts the

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,550
money in place to make this happen which

218
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,370
will then translate to smart cities

219
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:32,819
that's it excellent thank you Bob

220
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:37,050
now with a much more human centered view

221
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:40,680
on on this issue is Denise Lee good

222
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,839
afternoon everybody I'm nice Lee and I'm

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,719
a South African living here in the

224
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,820
United States I transferred to the US

225
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,850
roughly two years ago prior to that I

226
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,470
come from a fantastic little city called

227
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,140
Johannesburg which is one of the largest

228
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,550
cities on the African continent and in

229
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,949
my tenure with the lloyd's which is

230
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,319
roughly six years I previously led the

231
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,720
African practice for city solutions and

232
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,870
emerging technologies and I think when

233
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,930
we talk about technologies as they are

234
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,580
today we need

235
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,859
bring it all back to the concept of what

236
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,990
is you know what is their purpose what

237
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,000
is their function certainly on the

238
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,980
security side it's a massive massive

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,710
issue but we don't operate in a vacuum

240
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,050
and when we talk about hard-coding

241
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,120
technologies we also need to think about

242
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,459
what does it mean for you and I as the

243
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,529
individual the concept of smart

244
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,229
communities of smart cities of smart

245
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,910
nations is effectively a system within

246
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,980
systems and that's therefore pre-pre

247
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,329
mandates that those respective systems

248
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,820
whether there are systems of

249
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,459
transportation systems of security just

250
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,810
the core data blocks that are floating

251
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,839
around in the ubiquitous connectivity

252
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,520
that is I digital economy of tomorrow we

253
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,740
have to figure out how all of these work

254
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,630
together and if we take it back to the

255
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,020
human side and we think about us as

256
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,820
humanity how do we as individuals across

257
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,279
different countries different

258
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,339
communities between industry between

259
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,529
governments between academia how do we

260
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,810
start working together to create a

261
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:14,500
solution today that will safeguard our

262
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,969
survival into tomorrow so when we look

263
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,760
at all these technologies that are being

264
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,040
developed today the technologies for

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,380
tomorrow they haven't even begun to be

266
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,050
thought about how do we safeguard that

267
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,100
how do we safeguard ourselves if we look

268
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,500
at the Millennials and some of the

269
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,080
research that's being done they're super

270
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,390
comfortable to be able to give all all

271
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,370
access to themselves in terms of devices

272
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,810
right so whoever's got the data on them

273
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,510
whether they're accessing the internet

274
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,510
Facebook etc they're very very

275
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,069
comfortable to have that open to anybody

276
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,220
who needs it because that justifies

277
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,770
their respective requirements as all the

278
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,839
folks like myself of some higher

279
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,670
functioning introverts a little less

280
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,770
comfortable to share that kind of

281
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,349
information so what does that mean for

282
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,569
me how can I face god my information

283
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,310
while leveraging their information and

284
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,620
how does the government potentially look

285
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,140
to leverage that where we bring in

286
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,930
systems within systems together and it

287
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,360
all comes down to choice right are we

288
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,109
going to choose to be part of the

289
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,120
solution for tomorrow and I'll usually

290
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,960
give up a potential risk and be open to

291
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,040
a risk that someone else is

292
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,100
we're going to be in a position to

293
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,250
hacked into my last story my medical

294
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,170
records everything associated to me to

295
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,870
be able to safeguard tomorrow or am I

296
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:35,240
going to try and hand for that

297
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,620
regulation policy technology and and

298
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,200
this is a question that we as

299
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,030
individuals as citizens need to come to

300
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,010
terms with with the support with

301
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,620
government with academia with technology

302
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,980
because if we don't on some level give

303
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,200
it over we don't have much chance of a

304
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,970
sustainable future tomorrow because

305
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,400
we're running out of the resources we

306
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,740
certainly are so how do we come together

307
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,910
how can we bring the benefits of

308
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,850
tomorrow in such a way that we don't

309
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,490
effectively commoditize ourselves in

310
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,260
today if you go today there are websites

311
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,210
that are available that can actually

312
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,880
quantify how much you are worth as an

313
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,910
individual with your data your digital

314
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,430
identity right now how much you for me

315
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,439
Denise is worth in dollar terms today

316
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,939
and I tell you what when I have a look

317
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,590
at my value that's on the internet

318
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,500
excuse me because I'm worth a whole lot

319
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,170
more than a couple of hundred dollars

320
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,690
how do we safeguard the fact that

321
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,479
roughly two weeks ago legislation has

322
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:38,240
been positioned that is appears cannot

323
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,410
own all that data about me how do i

324
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,630
safeguard to opt in versus opt out where

325
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,579
are we from a legal perspective a policy

326
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,730
perspective how as we as communities

327
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,740
coming together to make sure that the

328
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,230
choices that I make are indeed for the

329
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,820
betterment of tomorrow for for my

330
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,330
friends for my family for my children

331
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,740
for myself without actually sacrificing

332
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,780
their future through that

333
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,250
commoditization process but it's

334
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,890
something I'm personally very very

335
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,780
passionate about technology in the cyber

336
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,000
realm is absolutely one of the

337
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,069
components that we have to consider but

338
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,200
again within the systems within the

339
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,690
systems of thinking there are many many

340
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,140
parties that come to play in addition to

341
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,140
the text

342
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,040
well thank you Denise and a new pump

343
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,570
you're going to talk a lot more about

344
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,520
some of the risk or the the attacks

345
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,160
themselves from a technical standpoint I

346
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,189
think but introduce yourself okay good

347
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,510
afternoon everyone I'm on a thumb from

348
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,170
Nanyang Technological University

349
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,870
Singapore so my take on this topic is

350
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,430
like when I moved from Germany to

351
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,040
Singapore I spent like 10 years in

352
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,939
Germany when I move to Singapore I

353
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,400
immediately realizes the country with

354
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,990
ecology fast track

355
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,270
everyone is having smartphone everyone

356
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,450
is very very keen and adopting to the

357
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:06,720
new technology and moving to whatever

358
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,600
new coming up extremely fast I had an

359
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,270
old Nokia phone with me coming from

360
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,010
Germany and I couldn't even find a SIM

361
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:18,329
card that I will use for this so I had

362
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:20,069
to opt for a new phone and in recent

363
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,970
times when you have following this news

364
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,260
about Pokemon go if you go to the

365
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,209
streets of Singapore it would be

366
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,029
extremely crowded everyone is looking

367
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:32,760
for Pokemon so I don't know about

368
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:35,880
security at that point or not but what I

369
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,200
have seen for sure is it's very smart

370
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,130
community I dropped into the new

371
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:44,700
technology it's very fast and for my

372
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,040
research in security it was until 2011 I

373
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,589
was working on microprocessor design

374
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,510
hardware accelerator design I was not

375
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,940
into cryptography or security something

376
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,490
like that and a collaborator requested

377
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,930
me okay can you design a accelerator for

378
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,120
us hardware accelerator for a

379
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,609
cryptographic primitive I said yeah we

380
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,810
can do this so you want it to be

381
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,420
low-power yes

382
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,208
we want to low area yes lightweight fast

383
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,790
yes we can do this so we did that and

384
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,740
then this collaborator said okay can you

385
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,109
please make it resistant towards side

386
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,760
channel attack and what's that said okay

387
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,469
you should not release too much

388
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,230
information about the power consumption

389
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,510
and then there are some techniques by

390
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,849
which you can actually mask this power

391
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,190
consumption whatever dynamic power

392
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:31,290
that's being consumed in the device so

393
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,210
we adopted that technology and we could

394
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,600
show that some masking is done

395
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,090
then they said okay can you prevent also

396
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,610
any information leakage through the

397
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,639
static power consumption what's that

398
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,370
even the processor of the accelerator

399
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,140
when it's not doing anything even then

400
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,139
it's silently releasing information and

401
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:56,310
that's enough to capture the key or

402
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,260
breach the confidentiality of it and we

403
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,310
couldn't have any clean techniques at

404
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,800
that time to block this and then we came

405
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,419
to know about more and more such kind of

406
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,280
side channel attacks and leakages

407
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,620
including fault attacks and if you look

408
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,260
into all the plethora of attacks that we

409
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,110
have right now to this hardware

410
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,800
accelerators mind-boggling and extremely

411
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:26,550
lightweight you can use a camera flash

412
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:30,020
to perturb a memory cell you can use

413
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:33,360
this hair dryer to heat up the chip and

414
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,820
cause it to malfunction at your own will

415
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,560
and you can see the outputs and you can

416
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,060
recover some information out of this

417
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,129
circuit now the bad thing about all this

418
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,530
is you cannot really the software patch

419
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,830
to correct it if the hardware is

420
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,690
designed and if you can malfunction it

421
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,659
using a Trojan or using a side channel

422
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,180
then it's gone and in recent times a

423
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,280
very prominent example of this is ro

424
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,590
hammer bug some of you might be familiar

425
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,620
with this that was discovered by some

426
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,560
researchers from CMU and then Google

427
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,540
showed that it can be done in a very

428
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,669
simple manner you keep on writing a

429
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:15,000
piece of assembly code in a part of your

430
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:18,090
memory repeatedly and then you can make

431
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,850
some bits of memory flip even without

432
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,100
accessing those parts so you can

433
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,159
actually have a very high privilege

434
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:30,300
escalation in your memory and that

435
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,510
defect is there in many laptops already

436
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,120
there you cannot really patch about this

437
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,740
so this is almost a end game for

438
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,290
security that you don't have a solution

439
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,460
to lot of problems when designing the

440
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:46,620
hardware and the attackers know this so

441
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,430
this is the situation that

442
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:53,489
we are in and then of course the best

443
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,080
way to stop it don't do any computing

444
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,550
don't do any communication okay then

445
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,740
you're secure or you put a lot of access

446
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,560
controls like what we call in the

447
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,320
traditional world is the operation

448
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,210
technology or ot security

449
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,830
only someone who's reliable would be

450
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,480
able to access this or not so we should

451
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,070
be doing this ideally to prevent this

452
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,290
situation but what we are seeing on the

453
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,830
other hand is we are actually giving

454
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,960
them in the wild earnest so if you look

455
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,000
into the Internet of Things phenomenon

456
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,170
cyber-physical system phenomenon then we

457
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,450
are actually going to put all the device

458
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:38,070
everywhere which could be really

459
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:39,570
accessed and easily compromised and one

460
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,470
of those scenarios that we are observing

461
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,500
right now in Singapore is we wanted to

462
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,360
try out with smart traffic management

463
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,860
such a technology adaptive nation it

464
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,560
tries to different technology very

465
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,530
quickly so what they said is we have a

466
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,620
lot of nice options

467
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:00,030
like mass that we transport the cars and

468
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,800
everything but we also want to have

469
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:05,010
something like a semi rapid transport

470
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,690
for the last line of transportation from

471
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,129
the metro station to your home there

472
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,950
will be a platoon of autonomous vehicles

473
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,420
very small semi autonomous vehicle and

474
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:17,430
that would carry to your home so this

475
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,860
kind of things are being experimented

476
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,420
right now and there are a lot of

477
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,070
researchers coming from the mechanical

478
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,400
engineering background automotive in

479
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,230
engineering background traffic

480
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,820
infrastructure background and of course

481
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,290
the electronics and computer science

482
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,590
experts they are collaborating together

483
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,389
to prepare a testbed to see how the

484
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,060
autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles

485
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,600
can be put together to create a very

486
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,919
smart Argonne traffic infrastructure and

487
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,649
this is the exact point that I raised

488
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,090
there I am part of this collaboration is

489
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:54,270
how secure this is and the ways you can

490
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:58,230
actually disturb this violate this

491
00:21:54,270 --> 00:22:00,000
traffic scenario is numerous so for

492
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,940
example you can compromise it

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,020
ethic sensor still so still there for a

494
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,370
few seconds that the detectors would not

495
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,520
be realizing that it has been

496
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,110
compromised and that can cause a traffic

497
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,830
disturbance in another part of the city

498
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,080
you can change the electronic road

499
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,639
pricing forcing the behavior of the

500
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,399
users to take another route

501
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,230
and of course not to mention about all

502
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,310
the compromises of the vehicle security

503
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,360
that we also discussed in today's

504
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,950
morning so this is the situation that we

505
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,270
are in and we are discussing many

506
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,930
different ways to put the

507
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,060
countermeasures of course to have

508
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,980
trusted IOT devices to have some kind of

509
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,330
at a station knowing full well that

510
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,590
there are many devices could be

511
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:48,270
compromised and I am glad that in the

512
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,370
studious description the topic is put a

513
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,490
secure and smart community and I will

514
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:56,189
stress on the topic community because it

515
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,440
has to play a very important role in

516
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,150
this transitioning phase where we know

517
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,030
about lot of vulnerabilities for which

518
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,130
the solutions are not clear so it could

519
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,260
come from the consensus protocols it

520
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,940
could come from the policy it could come

521
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,670
from the standardization but the

522
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,100
community has to enforce on how security

523
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:19,110
is being adopted in the smart

524
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:26,610
infrastructures all right Thank You fun

525
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:29,159
and finally yunxiang up thank you okay

526
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,429
who knows about yourself ah there your

527
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,140
side all right thank you first follow

528
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,600
people they are looking at page eight

529
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,350
how many of you know I'm a security risk

530
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,469
here because I'm not in Hawaii I'm

531
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,270
pretending to be here um okay so I'm

532
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,130
associate professor in each code in

533
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,930
computer engineering in the last several

534
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,870
years I've been building assistants you

535
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:54,270
look at the gobo network cameras how

536
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,120
many of you you counted how many cameras

537
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,040
you will see you when you walk on here

538
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,149
to lunch how many of you try to come

539
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,190
back once I was give a speech in a

540
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,140
conference and I asked how many cameras

541
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,320
are in a room we counted there were 17

542
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,200
cameras in that conference room and

543
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,210
field even even notice that

544
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,610
I'm a computer system person the reason

545
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,860
we build this is we talk about big data

546
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,469
what speaker there's video right we have

547
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,100
lots other video over the world we want

548
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:28,289
to entice the data so I have seen so I

549
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:33,379
talk about video I want to give you few

550
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:35,879
slides if this works okay so there was a

551
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:38,908
report about three years ago saying

552
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:41,070
about a quarter billion surveillance

553
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,919
camera deployed worldwide I think the

554
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,950
number probably a lot more now another

555
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,039
book h/h published in 2004 says they

556
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,740
have four million cameras in UK so you

557
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,350
count about every seeking person

558
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,379
there's a camera depot somewhere if you

559
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:01,230
go to new york the HT tell you there are

560
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:10,369
a lot of camera somehow this doesn't

561
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:10,369
work yeah quit the run button one whoops

562
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:18,409
okay most people don't even notice that

563
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:20,450
but we talk about smart communities we

564
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,860
over talked about sensors and amount of

565
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,900
sensors cameras are particularly

566
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,699
interesting because they generate so

567
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,690
much data you really new thing about

568
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,590
this in different ways let me give you

569
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,660
some examples

570
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,399
somehow tell me scuba type thank you

571
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,340
so imagine a situation like this this

572
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,980
was flooding in Houston about a year ago

573
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:46,550
actually exactly a year ago you can see

574
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:50,240
the traffic camera in Houston of the

575
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,430
left side are taken on April 18 last

576
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,530
year and right side are taken a few

577
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:57,740
weeks ago you can see these are the same

578
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,960
cameras so the lesson here is you can

579
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,840
use the camera to see what's going on

580
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,300
your city now what Texas is doing right

581
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,590
now is they have a people see thousands

582
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,350
of people sitting in front of hundreds

583
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,290
of computers of looking at those cameras

584
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:15,740
but if we could analyze the data in real

585
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:19,460
time by computers it's possible to have

586
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,110
a situation assessment in real time it's

587
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,500
not only Houston can you go to the next

588
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,389
slide please

589
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,070
also New York this was a project my

590
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,720
student did a few years ago my student

591
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,460
said I want to go to see the parade but

592
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,710
I don't have a money to pay the airplane

593
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,930
ticket so I say let's go to see the

594
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,550
parade without going there and so it

595
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,080
will build a system you can see the

596
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,399
parade it's actually better than going

597
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,379
there because you can see the entire

598
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,800
parade for many many cameras in real

599
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,560
time it's not only Clinton exercise free

600
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,720
not only in New York it's all the work

601
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,080
all the data I show here is publicly

602
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,050
available on the internet so that

603
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,970
bringing many interesting questions who

604
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:03,230
owns the data who can see the data who

605
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,740
can store the data if you have access to

606
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,650
when

607
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,960
camera maybe it's okay but you have

608
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,600
access to the data in the entire city

609
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,660
what kind of information can you get on

610
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,120
my student a tree look at the camera in

611
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,000
New York City my hand heads and we were

612
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,899
able to track a few vehicles across

613
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,500
multiple intersections we did manually

614
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,350
but

615
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,170
imagine you can do that by computers so

616
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,090
next slide is it's not only outdoor in

617
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,420
many cases also endure this is a

618
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:37,610
shopping mall of my former student was

619
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,570
very interested in this because they

620
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,120
want to improve their shopping

621
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,250
experience of their own and their

622
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,199
family's shopping experience so they

623
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,010
start looking at if you have the data

624
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,330
what can you do in this case thing about

625
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,440
people get tired and there are cheers

626
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,790
for the people they don't like shopping

627
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,980
but they have a family members that go

628
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,940
like they like to shop you would

629
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,510
appreciate the presence of shoes there

630
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,100
are many problems using camera networks

631
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:10,730
something are very low-tech it goes on

632
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:13,850
exercises if you also have a denial of

633
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,640
service attack you don't need any

634
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,679
computers it's not much shame as we've

635
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,680
seen we don't own them but the data is

636
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,030
publicly available we see then I observe

637
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,050
the attack by Birds

638
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:30,350
Oh spiders those cameras may be deployed

639
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:34,700
in places that difficult to access maybe

640
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:37,100
along borders or somewhere so that means

641
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,340
your information may not be guaranteed

642
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,189
so the last slide please there are many

643
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,590
opportunities and challenges you can use

644
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,610
camera to improve physical security I

645
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,110
have also seen one day that center of

646
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,389
the edge you use camera to improve later

647
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,719
cybersecurity they put came out to see

648
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:59,660
hood whether the room has been broken

649
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,970
into so they use camera to ensure their

650
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,490
cybersecurity you may be able to

651
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,350
discover trend by observing they have

652
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,570
for many many sources across long time

653
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,030
so that gives you some knowledge that

654
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,830
may not be available today real-time

655
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,860
analysis allow you to respond to

656
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,540
emergencies that is not available today

657
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,760
you don't believe what you see in movies

658
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,430
that they are still quite a few years in

659
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,410
the future if you can provide data from

660
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,600
many sources from camera from sensors

661
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,670
from weather report you may be able to

662
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,620
get a much better idea about what's

663
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,710
going on that's not possible

664
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,928
by using one source of data there are so

665
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,420
many different many challenges for

666
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:41,270
example data integrity and availability

667
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,220
our cistern we have a more than 100,000

668
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:47,030
came running off season now with that

669
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,370
amount of data every day we we see some

670
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,410
cameras up and something rather dunk how

671
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,360
do you get information when you don't

672
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,880
have a complete access to all the data

673
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,810
you want that that's another important

674
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,520
question the research I started is how

675
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,710
to deal with this month large amount of

676
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,840
data we when I gave a speech in

677
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,430
Microsoft Research a few years ago the

678
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,189
speaker in front of me said we get the

679
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,050
same hotel by the data a year when I

680
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,200
started I said again still terrified it

681
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,370
has a so that's the amount of data well

682
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,800
talked about and we are not even close

683
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:24,229
to the possibility if you get a trillion

684
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:29,000
billion cameras that's on the data you

685
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,060
need it's beyond today's technology open

686
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,280
today use people use camera as some kind

687
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:38,210
of host event analysis for example is a

688
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,160
crime but very often the knowledge of

689
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,530
autocrine the reportable point is to a

690
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,790
second chain or somebody call the police

691
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,310
the police is not watching the text the

692
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,570
data they never know that like the video

693
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,909
has recorded the crime

694
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,939
somebody call us please and the police

695
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,580
go go back to see the archive of the

696
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,140
data if that second channel doesn't

697
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,960
exist even though you have all the

698
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,510
evidence in your video you still don't

699
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,700
know what is there again the volume of

700
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,180
data is too big of I already mentioned

701
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,850
the data quality also if you have camera

702
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:15,620
outdoors you get a problem with whether

703
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:17,770
bird spots and so on also even today the

704
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,360
recognition rate for for computer

705
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,990
programs still very low as the last year

706
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,729
the one of the most popular competition

707
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:30,110
called large-scale image recognition

708
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,510
competition held by image net last year

709
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:35,090
the accuracy was 67%

710
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:38,990
a lot of state we are and you was won by

711
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:42,409
the top winners of big companies in fact

712
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:44,360
if you really news last year the

713
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:47,960
complete was so intense one company HTT

714
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,909
and what code of evil competition become

715
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,340
is wind achievements that complete is

716
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,679
very poor

717
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,860
it even with so many companies putting

718
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,110
so much resources the acre is only 67%

719
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,770
so there's a still long way to go using

720
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,428
the data to create smart community thank

721
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:08,070
you all right well thank you very much

722
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:12,150
and now I would like to turn the

723
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:18,629
spotlight on you and see if what

724
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:20,779
questions do we have for our panel and

725
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:25,049
I'm going to start us off a little bit

726
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:26,700
because we heard to give some you know

727
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:30,059
some of the technology some of the

728
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:33,600
technical problems that we have you know

729
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,610
from even there was a comment about

730
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,209
monitoring power for side-channel

731
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,889
effects and of course we've know about

732
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,080
things we talked about smart cities with

733
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,399
smart power meters right well gee if

734
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,480
everyone has access to that they can

735
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,658
know when you're home when you're on

736
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,600
vacation when you're away so the

737
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:54,990
question to the panel then is how in in

738
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,299
this society how are the threats

739
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:01,830
changing how are they evolving in the

740
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,299
future well I'll just comment that going

741
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:09,210
back to the camera example I never

742
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:11,158
forget that 2010 I was in Dubai and I

743
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:15,450
was talking to the head of security in

744
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:19,039
UAE and he said you know if you remember

745
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:22,080
the recent assassination of the hamas

746
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,360
head of hamas over in dubai amateur if

747
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,559
anybody's remember that incident in 2010

748
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,860
he said that was a cyber attack so I

749
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:36,149
said why was that a cyber attack and he

750
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:39,629
said well because the agents who came in

751
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:43,080
to UAE our country and assassinated the

752
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,960
ammas leader in his hotel basically took

753
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,480
control of the camera system in the

754
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,720
entire city from the airport to the

755
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,830
hotel and back out again to allow them

756
00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:00,600
to go there and commit the assassination

757
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:02,820
and and so he said unfortunately we did

758
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,879
not have very good control and security

759
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,500
built into our account

760
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:11,960
and therefore the event occurred they

761
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,418
could easily occur at the Boston bombing

762
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,050
as an example but we all know how much

763
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:22,040
we leveraged the camera system to to

764
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:24,379
capture the guys that did that but to

765
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,509
your question more directly it goes back

766
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:29,719
to my earlier comment this is what I

767
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,679
told the general in UAE if you have

768
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:36,949
strong very strong hardware base

769
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,800
security and identity built-in to the

770
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:43,848
camera system it would make it very

771
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,980
difficult for an adversary to take

772
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,629
control of that system they didn't want

773
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,579
to knock that camera system by the way

774
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,098
out that's the last thing you want to do

775
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:54,440
that would have set alarms off they

776
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,200
wanted to take control of that camera

777
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,819
system leave the images in a state that

778
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,799
they were comfortable with which is

779
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:05,779
exactly what an adversary will do but we

780
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,030
need to be able to implement the kinds

781
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,520
of high assurance security which we're

782
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:13,760
not doing as we heard you know many

783
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,880
times over the last couple days to be

784
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,349
able to prevent those kind of attacks

785
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,040
Hardware based security which I said

786
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:24,319
Purdue is working on quite a bit with

787
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,099
with as an ad is an example as a major

788
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:32,240
company will deal with issues like

789
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:36,020
side-channel attacks and in other kinds

790
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,089
of exploitation techniques and and

791
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,089
that's why it's imperative on all of us

792
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:43,160
to be able to raise the bar of security

793
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:46,160
from the level that we're dealing with

794
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,710
today which is very low to medium levels

795
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,259
of security to that high level of

796
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,940
security much of which is even we'll

797
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,730
hear Ron Ross talk about in the wrap-up

798
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:59,329
speech is included in the standards that

799
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,329
that NIST is articulating as we speak

800
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:04,609
but that's a very very important part of

801
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:08,520
how we have to move forward in the

802
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:11,860
future all right

803
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,800
Venetia want to respond sir yeah I think

804
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:17,080
in addition to that I think if we think

805
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,150
about attacks in the future just the

806
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,100
last 10 or 15 years giving us a bit of a

807
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,040
flavor the attacks were coming from

808
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,380
outside of our borders with the with the

809
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,759
move to the cloud right now and as that

810
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,350
evolved moving forward more and more

811
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,020
data is going to be uploaded into the

812
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,410
cloud the clouds will centralized

813
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,790
potentially outside of our jurisdiction

814
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,819
multiple jurisdictions and there's a lot

815
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:42,520
of layers of law associated with that

816
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,280
now depending on the culture in those

817
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,740
particular countries they may or may not

818
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,750
subscribe to the kinds of security

819
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,939
protocols that that we would ultimately

820
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,790
like to see and are able to safeguard

821
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,310
ourselves here in a specific geography

822
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,029
with technology evolving as rapidly as

823
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,250
what it is

824
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,930
especially the small IP related

825
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,570
generation that's coming out of emerging

826
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:07,000
technologies and the emerging

827
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,890
territories as well that stuff has been

828
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,950
slapped up into the cloud really quickly

829
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:14,650
it was fast adoption we're going to be

830
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:17,980
behind the curve in terms of knocking

831
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:20,230
that down as we evolve with time we need

832
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,900
read additional collaborative

833
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,520
collaboration in terms of communities as

834
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,250
to how we're going to handle that moving

835
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,530
forward and to complement the hard

836
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,000
related security and coding that we're

837
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,130
looking to implement as well because

838
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,260
otherwise everything can be locked down

839
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,690
in a physical device but if we don't

840
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:43,750
control it physical device we don't

841
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:46,420
control that security potentially thank

842
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:48,100
you I think I want to echo a few points

843
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,080
first I think collaboration is important

844
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,940
people on the stand security they may

845
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,830
not understand video if you are doing

846
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,670
video may not understand hardware

847
00:37:53,830 --> 00:38:00,580
implementation also one important factor

848
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,650
is the resource issue there you may have

849
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,680
a great algorithm but you can super much

850
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,750
power then you're not going to use it so

851
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,870
there are many factors need to be

852
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,880
considered so I think opportunity ideas

853
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,859
with expert from different fields is a

854
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,170
great opportunity to continue a

855
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:20,320
conversation and to have a further

856
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,119
discussion creating a solution covers

857
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,740
for data source once

858
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,240
dirty from the hotwing implementation

859
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,589
and the low-power and so on god by the

860
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,269
way i like to echo one thing the

861
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,740
professor gets said i think that's one

862
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:36,308
of the things that's very important as

863
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,799
we move forward in the future with with

864
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:40,359
newer technology in this area is the

865
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:42,099
fact that it has to be able to be

866
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,470
low-power you have to be able to deal

867
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,950
with the processing challenges the

868
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,899
memory challenges and and these security

869
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,689
systems have to be able to last

870
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:56,109
oftentimes fifteen to twenty years when

871
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,880
they're being deployed and so that's why

872
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:02,410
you have to have a whole new paradigm

873
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:07,029
for security as we move forward I have a

874
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:08,558
question for Denise excuse me you know

875
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:12,249
we've been doing a lot of work in smart

876
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,529
cities you read the ploy sensors as well

877
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:18,759
as cameras and all these kind of things

878
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:22,150
and Singapore in particular it's

879
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:25,660
interesting that when I'm interested

880
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:29,739
from you is what you see these cities in

881
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:32,379
terms of their thinking because as we

882
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:36,309
look as we work the problem it's more

883
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,950
than security in fact you know they want

884
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:41,829
because of the systems of systems issue

885
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,538
and and not understanding where the

886
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:45,910
boundaries and where the data is really

887
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:47,829
come from there are instances in where

888
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,558
we want the data to be available to

889
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:52,930
everybody so we want open public data

890
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,059
but we don't want it to be tampered with

891
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,460
or spoofed because we're using it for

892
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,440
decisions and but we want everybody to

893
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,799
have access to it so we can't encrypt it

894
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,960
right we have private data that we want

895
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:07,538
to monetize alright so we have to have

896
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,359
different monetization models yet we

897
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:13,299
have to support this idea of privacy

898
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,400
security rights management and then we

899
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:18,038
have the data that the government wants

900
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,749
to protect yet we want inanimate eyes

901
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:22,299
that in such a way that we can drive

902
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:25,118
trends analysis and things like that

903
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:27,279
while protecting privacy so what I see

904
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,619
is it's a real challenging issue and

905
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:32,950
because of that we're in the process of

906
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:36,550
deploying many things that don't address

907
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:39,129
any of the needs that we're stating

908
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,650
we have to have so I'm interested with

909
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:45,180
your experience and background what do

910
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:49,240
you see coming together in the way of

911
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:51,370
regs or standards or how do you see the

912
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,250
community beginning to come together to

913
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,350
pull all these competing issues kind of

914
00:40:54,250 --> 00:41:00,550
together and bring the whole community

915
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:02,200
together around these kinds of issues so

916
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,350
that's a great question thank you I

917
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,939
think each I mean the concept of what a

918
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,620
smart city is I think there's more

919
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,900
literature out there today of what it is

920
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,759
not if we look at definitions our bodies

921
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,710
have come together internationally to

922
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,870
define what is a smart city what is

923
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,060
smart infrastructure we've got the likes

924
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,799
of the United Nations involved you know

925
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,360
defining what smart infrastructure is

926
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,360
giving guidance we've got the smart

927
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,390
cities council I think the important

928
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,130
thing is is the fact that there not been

929
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,080
body standing this up by themselves

930
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,880
there are collaborative entities

931
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,170
communities that are coming together to

932
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:41,100
define what the thing smart thing should

933
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,570
look like moving forward and it's a

934
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:46,480
collaboration between industry between

935
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:50,290
business between communities between

936
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:54,520
normal citizens as well as governance

937
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:56,740
bodies and the government and you know

938
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,259
whether it's about creating an open data

939
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,959
standard to make information readily

940
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,120
available that can you know also

941
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,680
information we put into one really nice

942
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,000
little bucket and we can slice and dice

943
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,339
that the different things from the

944
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,440
cameras been able to interface that with

945
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,940
the FBI's most wanted database as you're

946
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,680
driving down the road using those

947
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,510
cameras and the gantry because you paid

948
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,049
your EasyPass I mean that's the ultimate

949
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:22,660
vision of what this is certainly that

950
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,190
comes with some choices so in my

951
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,960
experience working across the emerging

952
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,050
territories some of the trends that

953
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,120
we're seeing now is is how we can

954
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,130
actually get our arms around the areas

955
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,170
of focus is this a new city that's being

956
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,750
being created from the ground up like

957
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,880
we've seen relaxing by we're seeing

958
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,520
quite a lot in Africa that's happening

959
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,200
now in Asia etc or is this an evolving

960
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,420
city where we have to refine and replace

961
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,740
existing infrastructure like the London

962
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,750
Underground and things like that because

963
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,029
that you know the military element is

964
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,730
shoe

965
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,790
and where we're seeing a lot of success

966
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,320
is is in those cities that have got a

967
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,440
very clear vision where they've had that

968
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,410
collaboration with the communities from

969
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,510
a faith perspective from a nonprofit

970
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,640
perspective and how they built a multi a

971
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,250
multi-channel collaborative approach

972
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,509
where everybody works together to come

973
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,180
up with what this thing should

974
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:18,330
ultimately look like it's not even it's

975
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,509
not quick and there's a lot of healthy

976
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:23,700
debate the cool thing is the backbone in

977
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,170
which all of this happens upon right so

978
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,750
what does that infrastructure look like

979
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,760
and everything just seems to be coming

980
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:33,570
back to the data to your point who owns

981
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,650
the data so in the event it's a new city

982
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,880
it's a bit easier with a new city

983
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,080
because you're buying everything you're

984
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,240
dropping it in brand new shiny

985
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,220
whoever's dropping in that broadband is

986
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,870
able to say these are the guidelines

987
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,700
that we're going to put on top of it if

988
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,259
we give you free access to the broadband

989
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,580
these are our terms and conditions in

990
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,040
which we're going to play in the sandbox

991
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:55,049
and the more folks that are involved in

992
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,880
that in terms of industry in terms of

993
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,840
the community as well as the government

994
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,550
they're actually starting to create

995
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,340
schools of thought if you will like like

996
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,050
a Facebook culture right that has no

997
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,610
jurisdictional bonds they've got their

998
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,770
rules of what they were going to do and

999
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,660
how you need to interact and we're

1000
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,420
starting to see trends like that that's

1001
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,430
happening today those are the areas

1002
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,290
where we've seen success other areas in

1003
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,810
terms of the legislative component and

1004
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,610
in your life has changed some of the

1005
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,730
legislation around differentiating

1006
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,870
between private data and public data and

1007
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,960
they've gone into quite a healthy

1008
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:32,460
breakdown of what that means again it's

1009
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,800
a work in progress they've got multiple

1010
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,800
communities they've got multiple sets of

1011
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,080
legislations in which to work with the

1012
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,030
telcos are absolutely they have to be on

1013
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,960
board because they're the backbone of

1014
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:49,140
that and it's a process it's a journey

1015
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,270
yeah but generally it's coming from

1016
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,819
specific areas of we want to reduce

1017
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,280
crime we want to uplift the community in

1018
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,800
terms of job creation and it's

1019
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,450
bite-sized chunks I joke you know it's

1020
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,870
how are you each an elephant you take

1021
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:11,859
one bite at a piece at a time

1022
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:18,240
yeah zooni any other questions from the

1023
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:21,360
crowd okay

1024
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,439
John introduce yourself John Walsh with

1025
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,260
vice-president of secure technology at

1026
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,200
analog so what cities do you see is the

1027
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,840
leaders in thought leaders and

1028
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,720
implementation of technologies that

1029
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,390
support the values that that you see in

1030
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,930
smart cities and create the outcomes and

1031
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:48,129
the things that are you know education

1032
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:51,520
you know all that kind of stuff so every

1033
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,770
year there's a smart cities global award

1034
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,480
an event effectively that's being

1035
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,190
created last year it was awarded in

1036
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,170
Barcelona and they have a number of

1037
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,080
categories in terms of what constitutes

1038
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:03,580
being a smart city and again getting to

1039
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,380
grips with what this thing is there's

1040
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,080
multiple different types of definitions

1041
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,780
around innovation education to the

1042
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,400
masses whether its sustainability

1043
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,570
whether it's safety for the reduction of

1044
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,830
crime etc I think the communities if we

1045
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,750
think about it not the city of Valencia

1046
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:21,490
around Barcelona in terms of what

1047
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,530
they've been doing in their rapid

1048
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,209
response the ability to respond to an

1049
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:28,240
emergency situation in a really short

1050
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:31,870
space of time you know we've got some

1051
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,120
some cities or towns if you will that

1052
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,279
are busy evolving across Africa right

1053
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,200
now the key drivers of being around the

1054
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,390
ability to maximise their water

1055
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,319
shortages with partnering with the

1056
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,580
government as well as large and no

1057
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,790
alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage

1058
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,990
companies to to leverage the shortage

1059
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,690
and the war supplies and what they're

1060
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:55,149
doing on the end the smart utility side

1061
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:58,000
but I think Singapore swiftly stands out

1062
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:00,340
in the top 10 around their smart

1063
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,320
buildings initiative the city of London

1064
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,840
from a security perspective they can

1065
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,630
track you as you arrive in London until

1066
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,070
you leave London and I smile when you

1067
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:10,300
spoke about the number of cameras in

1068
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,610
here cuz I started counting the people

1069
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,110
and he's got a smart phone versus he's

1070
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,069
got a computer and voice and you

1071
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,229
probably ugly

1072
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:20,499
got I don't know well over 100 cameras

1073
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:21,848
in this room right now so being able to

1074
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:24,189
leverage that information with

1075
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:26,799
legislation just because your phone is

1076
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,599
not on you have an activated your camera

1077
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:30,190
doesn't mean that you know Big Brother

1078
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,499
is able to connect it and grab that

1079
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,509
information if they need to so I think

1080
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:38,229
there are a lot of different cities the

1081
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:41,199
UAE huge inroads there Australia in

1082
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:43,239
terms of what tis in doing to assist

1083
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,359
some of the the counting is in Australia

1084
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,099
with the sustainability issues on

1085
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:55,058
energizing them I think there are a lot

1086
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:57,699
for different things alright another

1087
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:59,589
question was sure absolutely so I drove

1088
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:01,329
up here from Nashville a few days ago I

1089
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:03,729
tried to stick to the main highway I

1090
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:06,489
pulled up a couple times on two side

1091
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:08,109
roads and it's pretty shocking how many

1092
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:10,630
communities are kind of going out of

1093
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:12,549
business they're you know abandoned

1094
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,529
stores it's very hard to even find a

1095
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:17,619
working gas station you know as you come

1096
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:20,380
up into into Indiana so I'm wondering

1097
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:23,319
are there any thoughts on how this smart

1098
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,930
city technology could maybe expand

1099
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:27,160
outside the you know the city limits and

1100
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,469
bring some of these other communities

1101
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,680
into the fold of kind of you know new

1102
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:31,680
technology

1103
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:44,400
absolutely so I think if we look at the

1104
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,930
technology that that is available today

1105
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,910
one of the key drivers or initiatives

1106
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,700
and the small cities initiative is on

1107
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:54,100
societal upliftment leveraging

1108
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,839
technology to through Wi-Fi through

1109
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,390
satellites to be able to get education

1110
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,940
to communities that can't get to a city

1111
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,910
center etc and and the few things around

1112
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:07,630
that is leveraging drone technologies as

1113
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:11,350
well as hard hard devices like I've had

1114
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:13,000
Google and books etc to take that

1115
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:16,440
education to those communities I think

1116
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,570
in terms of job creation and upliftment

1117
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,220
the ability to port one business today

1118
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,430
into a digital platform

1119
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:26,680
I think lends itself to be a good idea

1120
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,660
for certain environments and certain

1121
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,359
industries and less so for others but

1122
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:37,149
being able to to to think about smart

1123
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,820
banking so doing your banking on your

1124
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,980
phone and this new technology that's

1125
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,440
come out with with large players like

1126
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,790
G&G electrics etc with their light bulbs

1127
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,620
you can literally go and stand

1128
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,900
underneath their light bulb and download

1129
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,600
your banking details onto your smart

1130
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,960
phone etc so I think you know as as

1131
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,810
these devices continued to evolve and

1132
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,820
they start proliferating the environment

1133
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:04,480
if you will and whether its sensors on

1134
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,480
the roads the ability to track to social

1135
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,500
media analytics sentiment analysis etc

1136
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,520
where people are moving and the spatial

1137
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,800
Geographic technology that's there with

1138
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,020
the planning of new communities I think

1139
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,790
you know the world is going to continue

1140
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,290
to evolve I guess the key thing is

1141
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,940
making sure that we're leveraging the

1142
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,890
right technology in the right place and

1143
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,900
then that kind of comes back to the

1144
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,150
collaboration with communities how best

1145
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,600
to position it because it could

1146
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:33,010
potentially be quite a sizable expense

1147
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,549
you know one of the one of the areas

1148
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:38,380
that I was really surprised about when

1149
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,390
we were in Australia talking to their

1150
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:44,050
government you know was the smart

1151
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:45,490
agriculture area it is it's unbelievable

1152
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,300
the amount of innovation that within

1153
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,790
smart act

1154
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,579
that's revolutionizing everything around

1155
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:55,130
the world and we just scratch them we

1156
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:57,440
scratch the surface right now the only

1157
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,720
other thing I'd comment on is is while

1158
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,359
we will see these massive number of

1159
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,098
sensors being deployed

1160
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,700
hopefully all secured right with very

1161
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:09,770
good security you know the thing that's

1162
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,680
happening right now I when I look at

1163
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,569
innovation around the globe especially

1164
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,000
coming out of places like Silicon Valley

1165
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:20,359
is we're really in the middle of the

1166
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,339
machine learning arms race because

1167
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:24,740
that's going to be the thing that's

1168
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:27,589
going to be the big differentiator when

1169
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,808
it comes to this area and and then so

1170
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:31,730
again putting security into that process

1171
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:33,470
because the adversaries are going to get

1172
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:36,829
right want to get right into that

1173
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,058
machine learning AI arena because that

1174
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,190
is the brain that's going to be

1175
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:42,500
controlling a lot of these sensors that

1176
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,240
are going to be here but that's also why

1177
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,059
we have to respect you know the issues

1178
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,558
like data privacy and data rights

1179
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:52,250
management's and all these other issues

1180
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,260
at the same time wait a time for one

1181
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:57,170
more quick oh you want to comment on the

1182
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,730
bump we're glad to this comment is I am

1183
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,920
not old enough to understand how

1184
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,839
policies are design and so on but I

1185
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,690
certainly do have a feeling that the

1186
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:08,569
technology dynamics is too fast compared

1187
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,579
to the policy dynamics and the time it

1188
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:12,680
takes to implement a policy or to come

1189
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:15,890
up with a standardization to prevent us

1190
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,529
from any technological mistakes that's

1191
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,839
too unbalanced right now and somehow it

1192
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:23,809
has to be corrected and one thing that

1193
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:27,828
we cannot definitely do is to slow down

1194
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:35,119
technology the obvious solution is

1195
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:37,250
automatic policy final question Denise

1196
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,230
had mentioned that the definition is

1197
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,359
working I think so okay that's the

1198
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:44,299
definition of smart cities varies from

1199
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,569
place to place as do the interests and

1200
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:50,359
needs of certain cities around around

1201
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:51,740
the world and each of you have mentioned

1202
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:54,440
someplace I think you're doing it right

1203
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,540
I would love to hear examples of people

1204
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,549
think are doing it absolutely wrong or

1205
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,380
our focus or that you believe are

1206
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:00,680
focusing on the wrong things when there

1207
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,869
try

1208
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:09,589
to develop a smart community a smart

1209
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:12,470
city excellent question to take that one

1210
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:19,509
on I'm scratching my head you virtually

1211
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:23,660
and I think I mean to do something wrong

1212
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:26,809
you know I guess it comes down to the

1213
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:30,040
agenda right if the agendas being driven

1214
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:36,349
in such a way that it is benefiting a

1215
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:38,390
component of society you know is it is

1216
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:41,000
it wrong in terms of its nature I mean

1217
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:43,910
it should get quite existential here I

1218
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,119
think the folks that are doing it wrong

1219
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:49,220
are potentially those folks that are

1220
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,809
saying we need a solution today and

1221
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,058
we're going to jump in with both things

1222
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,339
and we're not going to consider what the

1223
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:58,609
potential butterfly implication is going

1224
00:53:55,339 --> 00:54:02,509
to be by doing it and to your point in

1225
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:04,910
terms of legislation right but you know

1226
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:06,950
I'm saying believer that good can come

1227
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,058
out of that as well right because if you

1228
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:10,368
think about some of the most amazing

1229
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:12,230
technologies that are around today they

1230
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:13,549
were created in someone's garage and

1231
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,069
everyone told them that they could never

1232
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:19,759
do it etc I mean if you just have a look

1233
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:21,799
at it cause you know the future the

1234
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:27,410
future land I mean you know it was wall

1235
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:29,839
street a minute sir now I give where

1236
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:32,328
things go wrong is when we try and do

1237
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,430
things in isolation right because then

1238
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:38,150
I've only able to leverage what I know

1239
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:41,359
I'm only able to do something to my

1240
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:43,760
maximum ability and I think if we

1241
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,589
consider the aspects of smart to

1242
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,390
consider that we consider the innovation

1243
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:49,779
index in terms of where we're seeing the

1244
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:54,710
most growers coming it's from involving

1245
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:58,490
academia into that as well is it wrong

1246
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:00,589
you know I could argue that even the bad

1247
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:04,098
guys in terms of the ability to innovate

1248
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:05,869
and do things that are really bad compel

1249
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,770
the rest of the good guys to be better

1250
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,710
at what they do

1251
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,410
so I'm not sure if that answers your

1252
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:13,549
question but good Christian I'll I'm

1253
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,270
definitely going to think of us that

1254
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:18,200
again

1255
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:22,090
I guess by my perspective is that I

1256
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:26,480
think the mistakes that I'm seeing is

1257
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:29,000
number one I believe the paradigm for

1258
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,900
the way we did security in the last 15

1259
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,550
years can't be applied to the future and

1260
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,610
so the other point is that where the I

1261
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,410
see no T come together you know we

1262
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,970
clearly want an end and strategy we

1263
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,560
clearly want to go from the edge to the

1264
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:47,089
cloud and we want to be able to be

1265
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:50,090
pervasive but we have to have security

1266
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:53,000
that's very agile very lightweight but

1267
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:55,070
very robust and that means you have to

1268
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,940
have security designed to be very

1269
00:55:55,070 --> 00:56:02,210
scalable to be able to meet that IT to

1270
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,910
ot environment to the edge to manage all

1271
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:07,310
these sensors to deal with the AI issues

1272
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:10,609
and so what we have is we have this

1273
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:14,920
massive massive security industry that

1274
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:18,680
many of us were from are from that are

1275
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:22,210
selling 20th century security them a

1276
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:25,279
little bit of 21st century pasted on

1277
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:27,080
bolted on right and that isn't going to

1278
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,420
work it's going to work a little while

1279
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,180
while the IT infrastructures are sort of

1280
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:35,060
there to kind of you know be there to

1281
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:37,250
kind of maintain stuff but is it going

1282
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,040
to work in the future could it quickly

1283
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,350
be obsolete and that's why we need to

1284
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,450
have strong policies and the only other

1285
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:47,690
comment I'd make on the policy front is

1286
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:50,450
that when we do smart cities or smart

1287
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:54,140
towns to the earlier point on rural

1288
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:56,450
environments it has to be a policy that

1289
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,810
requires that security standards be up

1290
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:01,790
at that level so it's secure smart city

1291
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,560
you know thoughts and my thoughts are

1292
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,690
very much alike as you see from my

1293
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,619
perspective you're seeing plenty of

1294
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:11,180
people who have kind of taken like the

1295
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:12,980
old cellphone approach so let's just get

1296
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,930
it out of will as we find the problem

1297
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,580
Jeff will throw security on top will

1298
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,609
patch at all instead of really trying to

1299
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,200
invest

1300
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,840
I think there's a lot of communities are

1301
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,339
trying to jump in this smart city but

1302
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,170
are just throwing things out there that

1303
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,340
are you're going to tie themselves to

1304
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:28,650
legacy there to be an awful lot of

1305
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,260
problems and not a decade from now

1306
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,420
I just Tigers for not once or something

1307
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,550
right exactly

1308
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,430
look how much money it costs you know

1309
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:40,350
all of us experiences in our lives you

1310
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:43,379
your tax dollars are needed see to build

1311
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:45,690
all these Metin massive cities then you

1312
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,450
do the road system second right and we

1313
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,580
all wait in line that I was the fight to

1314
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,230
get out of those those cities that's

1315
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,569
what we do with security we build the

1316
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:56,010
functionality but then all the amount of

1317
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:59,370
money it's going to take to recode

1318
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:01,800
reduce security you know it just breaks

1319
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:04,830
the bank and then everybody gets upset

1320
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,870
but but to both of your points I think

1321
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:09,180
we're today trying to build a solution

1322
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:10,859
for tomorrow I mean if we if we just

1323
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,540
think back at the evolution of

1324
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,510
technology in the last four years I

1325
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:19,259
think when the internet was both it was

1326
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:22,200
both the idea of sharing information and

1327
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,390
now we're trying to control it but so I

1328
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,180
think what we have today to your point

1329
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,950
I'm having an agile approach for

1330
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,720
tomorrow we are going to be going

1331
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,490
through that journey of ripping out and

1332
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,390
replacing because things are evolving so

1333
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:40,080
quickly so you know we build on our

1334
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:43,890
knowledge from yesterday more all right

1335
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:47,670
all right well thank you very much we do

1336
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:49,670
have another speaker yet and so what I'd

1337
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:55,739
like to do is thank our panels

1338
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:55,739
