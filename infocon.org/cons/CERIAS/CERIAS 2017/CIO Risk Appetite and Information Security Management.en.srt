during his time here his current

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,210
research interests include both IT and

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,210
information security management

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:40,850
management please welcome professor wing

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,710
back to campus David thank you okay

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,600
thank you I'm glad to be have a chance

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,050
to come back here and present one of my

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,350
papers okay and good afternoon okay so

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,870
this is about the CIO risk appetite and

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,420
about security management issues and my

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,190
co-author is from Stony Brook so we are

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,649
trying to work on this project for a

21
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,989
long time we look at the CIO we look at

22
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:07,250
the top management team we look at the

23
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:10,189
directors okay so the motivation of this

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,259
paper is kind of straightforward so we

25
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,500
have seen a lot of reports talking about

26
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:18,259
the CIOs role in today's environment

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,509
okay so we have a lot of really high

28
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,299
profile information security incidents

29
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,060
in recent years so we start to see that

30
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:30,560
information security management has been

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,619
a CL top priorities after all these kind

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,079
of security breaches okay and they say

33
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,270
that CEO is not just about investment

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,639
decisions it's about all the IT

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,759
resources it's also about the security

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
management issues okay and they talk

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,070
about a lot about the leadership style

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,740
that may affect how the CIO may make his

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,529
or her decisions okay so this kind of

40
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,658
leadership style may include that how

41
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,909
they try to approach these investments

42
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,820
how they try to interact with other

43
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,539
people in the team okay but there's one

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,060
key factor here is about risk-averse

45
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:11,390
aversion or how the level of risk

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,630
aversion here okay there are some

47
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,459
anecdotal evidence here okay so we can

48
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,340
see there are some commentaries or

49
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,090
articles about the sales risk aversion

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,500
so one stream of them saying that sales

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,860
cannot be risk averse

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,530
okay simply because that they will try

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,540
to stop they will try to stop to

54
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,159
initiate new projects they will try to

55
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,069
maintain the status quo

56
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,670
or they were not that willing to adapt

57
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,579
to new technologies okay but there's

58
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:48,109
some discussions also they say that

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:51,590
after 2008 after 2009 we start to see

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,329
more and more risk-averse CIOs and they

61
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,180
found out that it has nothing to do with

62
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:59,690
the economic conditions okay it's just

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,239
like they are not that willing to take

64
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,480
risk or trying to do more exploratory

65
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,690
things okay so we find it kind of

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,470
somehow contradictory results from those

67
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:15,170
professional articles okay and we also

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,569
notice that it's not just about the risk

69
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,410
aversion level they start to talk about

70
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:24,589
that when the CIO is on the board they

71
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,690
can make more strategic decisions they

72
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,810
may have more influential powers over

73
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,849
the whole company okay and they say that

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,790
a lot of times the sale can now make the

75
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:39,440
decision or it looks like the CIO is

76
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:42,319
risk-averse simply because that the CEO

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,620
is trying to limited the actions the CIO

78
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,839
may take so for example the CEO doesn't

79
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,840
want to have initiate new projects and

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,720
there are some budgetary issues so the

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,180
CEO may be limited okay so it's not

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,760
really about the sales personality but

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,859
it's more like what kind of position

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,840
that Yale is in and what's the

85
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,760
interaction between the scale and the

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,540
CEOs okay

87
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,120
so these are our motivations so this we

88
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,989
are trying to explore this issue from

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,599
three different perspectives okay the

90
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,579
first one is we want to understand what

91
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:22,669
the association between CIO risk

92
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,310
aversion and the possibility of reported

93
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:29,270
security incidents okay so it's more

94
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,729
like based on our discussion earlier if

95
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,400
a CIO is risk-averse

96
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,400
and email circuits IT investment

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,580
decisions how the CL may approach new

98
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,089
issues how they may do all these

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,490
deployments of IT resources so this may

100
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,789
affect how they can protect the IT

101
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,529
assets or these information assets okay

102
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,259
so that's why it may affect the

103
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:57,110
possibility of security breaches okay so

104
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:59,539
it's more like what's the final outcome

105
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,279
of the effectiveness of security

106
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,979
management okay

107
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,649
then we look at that when the CIO is on

108
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,508
the board when this person has more

109
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,419
influential power in terms of strategic

110
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:15,050
decisions over the whole company will

111
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,240
that change our results okay and the

112
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,740
last one will be the interaction between

113
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,270
the CIOs and the CEOs how these two

114
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,949
leadership in the company when they have

115
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,149
some interactions in terms of their

116
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:31,490
personality will that change our results

117
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:34,279
okay if your question feel free to stop

118
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,899
me at any moment okay

119
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,999
so interestingly when we go back to the

120
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,129
literature and we try to search for

121
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:47,870
anything all kinds of literature about

122
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:50,689
the CIOs or in security management we

123
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,620
don't find anything specific about risk

124
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:57,589
aversion okay so we have seen people

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,189
talk about the role of CIOs their duties

126
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:04,580
obligations this stream of literature

127
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:06,319
kind of old there are a long time ago so

128
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,659
it's more like at that time we don't see

129
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,860
that many CIOs so that's why they start

130
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,498
to talk about the roles and the

131
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,919
personalities the characteristics the

132
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:18,860
obligations okay and then we start to

133
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,919
see that okay it's not just about a CIL

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,699
what's the interaction between this IT

135
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,649
leader and the whole top management team

136
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,449
okay so that's why that's the time we

137
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:33,259
start to see there's some coordination

138
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:36,469
issues how IT management they try to

139
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:39,349
reward their employees how we look at

140
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:42,409
different coordination across function

141
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,409
has all these kind of issues that's a

142
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:47,010
second string

143
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:50,610
okay the third stream is about whether

144
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:54,000
they can really create value the first

145
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,580
paper is this one between the early 2000

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,480
okay at that time people start to argue

147
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,310
that okay so you can have a CIO you

148
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,900
start to put this information technology

149
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,960
to a more like strategic positions that

150
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,380
means you focus more on IT issues but

151
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,719
does it really help or does the markets

152
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,350
or the investors do they really believe

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,560
that when I create a new position I can

154
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,660
better manage my IQ resources or whether

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,630
I can better manage my information

156
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,760
assets okay so that's why they have this

157
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,700
kind of research totally talking about

158
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,219
CIOs impact or whether they can create

159
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:39,420
the value for the company so again

160
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,250
that's 15 years ago okay and then you

161
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,280
have a stream of literature talking

162
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,580
about the strategic alignment okay so

163
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,609
one of the big issue people have been

164
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,419
debating on was the business goal in the

165
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,050
IT goals

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,270
okay so a lot of times I say that in the

167
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,120
past a lot of strategic decisions were

168
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,890
made simple it because that hey I want

169
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,220
to do this investment because my

170
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,890
competitor is doing that okay so they

171
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,320
focus so much on IT investment but they

172
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:13,380
start to forget that there's some

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,900
business goes there and RIT stroll and

174
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,480
how this IT stromae support our business

175
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,969
objectives or can we use this

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,800
information technology to achieve new

177
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,610
things okay

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,180
and the last one it's closer to to our

179
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,310
case it's about the CIO characteristics

180
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,190
okay so they start to talk about okay

181
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,039
this is your leadership style this is

182
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,830
how you can interact with people this is

183
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,218
how you make decisions okay but again

184
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,740
oh we do not really see anything

185
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:51,920
specifically about the risk aversion or

186
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:55,129
the risk appetite issues okay

187
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,889
so after we have seen a lot of papers

188
00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:00,889
about the CIOs issues or the top

189
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:04,999
management team we notice that there are

190
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:07,579
only two formal journal papers started

191
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:10,249
about CIO information security

192
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:13,339
management okay the first one is about

193
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:17,480
the position and compensation okay so

194
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:20,299
their argument is that if there is a CIO

195
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,419
position that means the company focused

196
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:25,819
more on this information technology they

197
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:27,889
are willing to spend more efforts they

198
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:30,108
are willing to spend more resources on

199
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:33,649
this domain that's why they are willing

200
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:37,839
to have this position there okay so from

201
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:40,730
this perspective it is more likely that

202
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,939
this company can have more resources

203
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,839
devoted to the IT put up this IT

204
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:50,509
perspective okay so probably they were I

205
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,509
can do a better job in managing their

206
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,189
information assets so it select likely

207
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,610
to have some bad things for these

208
00:09:55,189 --> 00:10:01,339
companies okay and they found these kind

209
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:06,169
of results and the second part is about

210
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:08,419
compensation okay so they say that when

211
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:11,779
the CIOs compensation package is

212
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:15,379
different it reflects a sales

213
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:19,369
willingness to devote efforts and the

214
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:20,989
willingness to take risks okay so in

215
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:24,319
this paper they put it in two different

216
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:27,889
positions so one is CIOs who is only

217
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:30,139
willing to take salaries okay whatever

218
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,869
I'm doing the only thing I will get is

219
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:35,059
just a fixed salary okay no matter the

220
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:38,089
performance is good or bad my salary

221
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:40,039
will not change this is one type of CEOs

222
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,129
they say that details are really

223
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,129
relatively more risk-averse okay

224
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,730
they have another part of the story when

225
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:53,089
the CIO is more willing to take options

226
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,669
stock awards that means the CL has some

227
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,489
more relatively are willing to give more

228
00:10:55,669 --> 00:11:01,819
efforts to this position okay because

229
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:04,280
the options in Star Wars Awards tie

230
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:07,939
closely to the CIOs performance

231
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,100
okay so they say that they can somehow

232
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,890
categorize CIOs into different groups

233
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,250
based on how they calculate their

234
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:22,290
compensation packet okay and they say

235
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:24,210
that for those fixed part for the CEOs

236
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,400
who are willing to take those fixed

237
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,540
salaries the management needs more

238
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,100
effective okay the second one also talks

239
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,469
about the information security

240
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,500
management but it's more like the

241
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,200
composition of the top management team

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,500
okay so they look at whether the

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,570
tablinum is younger or whether the top

244
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,920
managing has more insights about the

245
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,200
company okay so they focus more on the

246
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,870
coordination issues the willingness to

247
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,430
accept new things the willingness to

248
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:01,410
take more adventures okay and show that

249
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,989
based on different age groups based on

250
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,270
different ten years of this top

251
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,250
management team the results of

252
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:14,449
effectiveness of information security

253
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,450
management will be different okay yes

254
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,720
yeah cuz yeah yeah I'm just curious it

255
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,880
gives you you've got that two papers but

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,770
they are both values so either the

257
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,660
teacher or on this topic around the wall

258
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,110
for the past ten years

259
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,480
there's only several of them or most of

260
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,270
them are conference papers okay

261
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,910
right and their focus they focus on the

262
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,610
CIO in the top management team but it's

263
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,969
not specific to information security

264
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,040
management okay very few of them okay

265
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,900
and one of the reason is that I'm going

266
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,050
to talk about this is that there are

267
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,050
some technical difficulties to collect

268
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,780
the information right that's why okay

269
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,790
yeah all can you explain your papers a

270
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,560
little more was it like a meta-analysis

271
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,959
type of papers or did you actually

272
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,410
conduct a study for these okay sure

273
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,600
so for both of this papers we actually

274
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,650
try to collect

275
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,050
the information security incidents okay

276
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:27,079
candy from news articles it can be from

277
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,510
the privacy breaches so we can collect

278
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,570
them and at that time there was also

279
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:34,819
database called data loss database so we

280
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,980
collected sanim for profit organization

281
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,550
so it collects all the information and

282
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,980
for cio and top management team we

283
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,500
collect that comes those information

284
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,420
just company by company so for each

285
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,540
company will try to identify whether

286
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,599
there is a need cio positions okay and

287
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,510
how many people are on the top mentor

288
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,480
team and their ages their education

289
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,480
background all this kind of things okay

290
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,979
okay so after we review those security

291
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,770
management takers so we switch our focus

292
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:17,030
more specifically to this risk aversion

293
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:19,310
behavior right okay so we find this this

294
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:22,339
is kind of an old paper but we like this

295
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,260
kind of definitions here if they that

296
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,900
the risk is the characteristics of

297
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,360
decisions that is defined at the extent

298
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,300
which there's uncertainty about where

299
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,560
they're potentially significant or

300
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,959
disappointing outcomes of decision will

301
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,699
be realized so we know that this is just

302
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,590
risk right it's uncertainty in the

303
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,770
future sometimes can be good sometimes

304
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:46,400
can be bad but most of them we worry up

305
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,829
more about the passings okay and they

306
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,890
have done a lot of most of these are

307
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:56,570
surveys and experiments they notice that

308
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:59,439
risk can affect decisions of course okay

309
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,180
they say that each individual is

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,990
different in terms of our risk

311
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,790
preferences okay that's the reason why

312
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,950
sometimes we are willing to take more

313
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,589
risk some other people's are not willing

314
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,040
to do that and they say that this

315
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:19,130
attitude is pretty consistent across

316
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,890
different context so it's more like this

317
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,050
internal thing actually makes all the

318
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,640
kind of all kinds of risk decisions or

319
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,370
risk behaviors okay so if we collect all

320
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,790
the information about risk aversion or

321
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:37,520
behavior or risk decisions we summarized

322
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,949
there are two different possible actions

323
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,540
of CL may take Aggie or she is

324
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:47,150
risk-averse okay one is that if he or

325
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,880
she is risk-averse he may want to just

326
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:53,230
maintain the status quo okay so they

327
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,210
don't want to do too much exploration or

328
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,950
exploit existing knowledge may be good

329
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,680
enough okay

330
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,900
so you may not be able to see that the

331
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,260
company is trying to learn new things or

332
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,240
try to have investments in new areas

333
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,860
okay so in this case we believe that the

334
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,380
information security management is

335
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,660
weaker simply because that you are not

336
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,290
able to follow the new trends or the new

337
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:21,589
threats okay but it's also possible that

338
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,040
when the CIO is risk-averse he or she

339
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,880
wants to protect everything okay so it's

340
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,449
more like the CL may overestimate the

341
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,660
risk of the companies facing okay so we

342
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:38,330
have so many information assets I have

343
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,949
to protect everything okay but the

344
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,930
problem here is not really about

345
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,120
security management because you're

346
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,910
trying to protect everything the problem

347
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,720
is that you may spend too much too many

348
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,930
resources on those less or relatively

349
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,930
less important information assets okay

350
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,300
so the investment is not that efficient

351
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:02,870
okay but for security management you may

352
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,419
do a better job in this case okay so we

353
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,189
look at those anecdotal evidence we look

354
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,429
at those prior literature's in different

355
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:13,730
context we're unable to determine which

356
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:16,520
one is a more appropriate one from the

357
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,290
theoretical perspective okay so that's

358
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,329
why we say that this may be just an

359
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:24,909
empirical question that we want to

360
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,909
explore a little bit more okay

361
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,669
okay so if you can remember that we say

362
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,949
that from those professional articles

363
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:36,889
they say that it's not just about the

364
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,559
CIOs risk preferences it's about that

365
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:42,139
whether the CIO is in a really important

366
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,600
strategic positions okay

367
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:47,330
so in recent years we have seen this

368
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,570
more and more popular so they try to

369
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,809
invite the CIO to join the board okay so

370
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,580
one is that they want to know more about

371
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:58,850
how they do information technology

372
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,820
investment but another perspective is

373
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:04,789
that they want them to be there in order

374
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,759
to defend those high profile security

375
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:10,700
threats okay so they want to bring this

376
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,620
up to the strategic level to make sure

377
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,309
that they can really do a good job here

378
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,008
okay so in this case if a sale can be on

379
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:21,590
the board and we believe that that

380
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:24,470
investment tendency or protection

381
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,519
tendency will just be amplified right

382
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,350
because now I'm on a strategic position

383
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,389
if I want to protect everything I will

384
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,389
have more decision power I will have

385
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:37,729
more resources to do that the same thing

386
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:41,719
if I just want to keep maintain the

387
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,809
status quo I try to do last exploratory

388
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,820
things I try to maintain what I'm doing

389
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,220
now in order just to exploit in my

390
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,428
existing knowledge when I'm at a

391
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,340
strategic position I have more power to

392
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:57,500
implement what and believe to be true

393
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,870
okay so that's why we believe that they

394
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:05,149
will amplify it and have a bigger impact

395
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:07,939
here the last thing is about the CEOs

396
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:11,029
risk aversion this is kind of tricky

397
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,960
here okay so when we look at those cynic

398
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:16,639
dodo evidence we say that a lot of times

399
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,580
some companies delegate the IT

400
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:23,330
investment decisions to the CIOs but

401
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,399
some other companies don't okay the CLS

402
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,428
do have the final decision right on all

403
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:31,100
kinds of major investment decisions okay

404
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,470
and the CEOs knows the overall picture

405
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:37,129
of the company and know the budgetary

406
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,429
issues okay so what's the interaction

407
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:44,719
between the CIO and CEO or risk averse

408
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:47,690
level okay so in our case if the CL

409
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,330
wants to invest more they try to protect

410
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,119
everything but it depends on actually

411
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,519
depends on the CEOs attitude so if the

412
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,860
CEO is really risk-averse this is that

413
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,049
how we don't have enough budget I don't

414
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,899
want to initiate new budgets or don't

415
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:05,869
want to initiate new IT investments even

416
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:08,689
the CIO wants to protect things II may

417
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:11,570
not work as expected okay

418
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,269
the same thing this year the CEO may

419
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,600
also overestimate all kinds of risks

420
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:19,399
because of the CIOs decisions okay so in

421
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,519
that case this year we'll also worry

422
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:24,619
that oh we can I just do this we need to

423
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,429
spend more efforts on how to protect our

424
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:30,649
information assets okay so that's why we

425
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,950
say that there must be some interactions

426
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:36,709
and that interaction maybe may amplify

427
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:43,279
these results or try to reduce the CIOs

428
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:46,399
efforts okay but risk aversion has long

429
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,240
being a tough issue for researchers to

430
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:53,119
capture okay so in the past you will see

431
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,169
these two things here one is called the

432
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,178
asset allocation approach okay and the

433
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:04,879
other one is called a lottery payoff to

434
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:08,929
cost ratio approach okay the first one

435
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:12,019
is I try to do surveys or try to do

436
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:15,529
experiment so it's more like we have a

437
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:18,889
group of 40 people and I say that now I

438
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:22,309
have a portfolio of less risky and some

439
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:25,008
really risky investment decisions I'll

440
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:28,100
let you do make those decisions okay

441
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:30,950
then I will see that okay based on your

442
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:34,369
personal characteristics we are more

443
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,590
willing to take the risky profile or you

444
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:40,399
are more willing to take the safe

445
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,320
profile okay this can only be done

446
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,678
through surveys and most of time it's

447
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,158
just an experiment okay the second one

448
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,700
is the lottery payoff to cost ratio so

449
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,119
the meaning of this one is you have

450
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,909
impales

451
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,129
and you have a cost so we have everyone

452
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:02,219
in the room so I try to adjust the

453
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:05,149
payoff and the coast so for example if

454
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:08,159
you need to spend $10 but you can get

455
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:12,389
$100,000 back are you willing to spend

456
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,929
that $10 okay another scenario you need

457
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:17,879
to spend $10,000 but you can only get

458
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,849
$100,000 back with the probability of

459
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:24,238
for example 50% are you willing to

460
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:26,698
invest at $10,000 okay so they are

461
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,289
trying to give you different payoff to

462
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:31,499
this cost ratio with all these

463
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,959
probability things and see how you can

464
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:37,799
link your personalities to your

465
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:40,859
decisions okay but as you can see that

466
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,899
if you want to do this you need to do

467
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:49,168
surveys you need to add to experiment

468
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:51,629
and it's almost impossible for us to ask

469
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:54,479
an cio to do all these surveys or to

470
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:56,938
come here to do the experiment one is

471
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:59,399
that there are too expensive there's no

472
00:22:56,939 --> 00:23:01,949
way we can pay their time okay the

473
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:04,918
second thing is that when we send a

474
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:06,779
survey to CIOs if they don't have time

475
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,299
to answer your questions we may get

476
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:12,469
something from his secretary or from his

477
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,059
staff okay we're not so sure what's the

478
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:17,939
what's the actual information inside all

479
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,918
these things okay so we have been

480
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:22,019
searching around to see whether we can

481
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,679
get this kind of risk aversion measures

482
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:29,819
just directly from publicly available

483
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,599
data or from this information that we

484
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:37,129
can collect with some reasonable efforts

485
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:40,979
okay then we saw something like this

486
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:47,428
they use this to capture the CEOs risk

487
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:50,309
appetite okay so the original design

488
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:53,789
behind all this thing is that when the

489
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:56,428
CI a-- 20 CEO is older compared to those

490
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,158
younger ceos they have a different

491
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:01,949
tendency to take risk generally younger

492
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,589
people are more aggressive they are

493
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:07,020
mulling to take risk in general the

494
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:09,120
tenure is also an issue well

495
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,770
when you are in the same position for a

496
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,979
long time generally we're more

497
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,700
risk-averse compared to your on to a new

498
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,820
position we have more energy to do new

499
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,220
things okay and it's also about the

500
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,210
percentage of the shares you own about

501
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,880
the company okay so if you owe a lot we

502
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,500
actually tie your benefits actually to

503
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,230
the company's survival or to the

504
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,050
company's performance so the action will

505
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,300
be different or the market value of your

506
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,879
stocks and options right okay so when

507
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,559
the market value is going up you have

508
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,450
more actions you want to take more

509
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:49,379
actions to make sure that you stay there

510
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:52,950
or going further okay so it's more like

511
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,580
we are trying to use this aged tenure

512
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:00,510
shares owned or stocks and options to

513
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:04,830
see how this may related to this

514
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:07,770
person's risky decisions but the problem

515
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,399
is that we are not able to observe all

516
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:15,120
kinds of risks risk-based decisions the

517
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:19,170
only thing we can observe is how the CEO

518
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,340
choose its compensation packet okay so

519
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,320
if the ceos is that met celery is only

520
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,990
$100,000 a year but I'm willing to take

521
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,600
a huge amount of options in stock Awards

522
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,370
then that's something that we need to

523
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,129
consider right they don't really care

524
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:39,750
about a fixed part to take more effort

525
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:41,490
based compensation okay so that's why we

526
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,610
try to do these kind of regression

527
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,940
models so the dependent variable is the

528
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:54,030
salary divided by total compensation

529
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:58,410
okay yes please in the option situation

530
00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:01,170
for CEO compensation and how did they

531
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,690
get awarded options is it based on how

532
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,330
few breaches they incur the

533
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,780
profitability of the company how much

534
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,230
money they spend versus that that's an

535
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,230
excellent question

536
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,390
CIOs are not like CEOs so most of the

537
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:20,860
time for my observations see I also only

538
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,470
get salary for

539
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,469
very very few of them have options okay

540
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:30,440
and that's the reason behind somos

541
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:34,430
that's the real reason behind that we

542
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,710
only use salary / total compensation so

543
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,830
it's more like because we know everyone

544
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:43,130
has a salary so for example 60%

545
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,899
everything else it's the adverb aced but

546
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,510
something else cake bonus there's some

547
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,490
CL tech stocks but your correct option

548
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:54,890
is very few okay and based on this model

549
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:58,670
we are able to capture that this

550
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:01,970
parameters here so this parameters shows

551
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:04,340
that how this age tenure in this

552
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,990
percentage of shares owned may

553
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:13,070
contribute to this risk based actions

554
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:15,590
okay so when we have a new observation

555
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,100
here we can calculate this predictive

556
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,990
value that's how we call the lambda here

557
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,730
okay this is the latent risk aversion

558
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:28,850
matrix so we can somehow

559
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:34,070
quantified this kisk appetite based on

560
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:39,169
this regression models okay yes what's

561
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:42,710
the e subscript J key okay so this one

562
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:47,240
here is the noise or other things that

563
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:51,530
are not captured by everything from here

564
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,930
to here okay so it's more like I have

565
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,879
included a lot of different factors but

566
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,340
of course they're always something that

567
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:04,130
we cannot capture right but that thing

568
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:07,159
will be here and based on the size of

569
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:11,240
this one and based on the level we can

570
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:14,410
try to quantify that how good this model

571
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,850
is that means if you have a lot of noise

572
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:20,090
then your model cannot really explain

573
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:24,469
anything right so ideally we want this

574
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:27,800
part the alpha 1 to alpha 4 part can

575
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,160
explain both of the things and the noisy

576
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,430
part is just a tiny 4

577
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:37,160
this so the e subscript J is a constant

578
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,850
but no it's not a constant so sets are

579
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,450
variable

580
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,370
yeah buddy this is just the difference

581
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,540
between the predictive value and the

582
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:49,909
actual value the error okay goose I'm

583
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,730
sure understand in this case our C is

584
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,560
known areas that deserve is a value

585
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,730
doesn't know yeah it's a value the

586
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:04,070
Layton risk-aversion matrixes it's the

587
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:08,630
whole predictive value from here so it's

588
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:12,320
dead within old Israel for new records

589
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,350
no for new records we will know alpha 1

590
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,780
alpha 2 alpha 3 and knock off all right

591
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:21,260
then for new records when we have a CI

592
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:26,540
oh Sh we're plugging the cos H times

593
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:29,330
alpha 1 plus alpha 2 times the new the

594
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,270
tenure information we collect plus alpha

595
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,980
3 times the percentage of here's own

596
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,840
that we collect for a new observation

597
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,360
and then we'll do the same thing here

598
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,240
then we will have the predictive values

599
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,240
here so we are trying to find e in that

600
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,280
case what's the unknown Oh what are the

601
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,370
equation trying to solve and it

602
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,040
confusing okay so then for all kinds of

603
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:56,780
models yes there's always a particular

604
00:29:52,040 --> 00:30:01,129
part and the noise part okay so how come

605
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:05,060
we have a noise parting if we can

606
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:10,340
predict this RC here based on everything

607
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:13,520
from here to here perfectly 100% then we

608
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,470
don't have any error here of course but

609
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,810
most of times you won't be the case

610
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,160
right so that's why every time we're

611
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,070
going to try to do the prediction

612
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,860
there's always some kind of things that

613
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:28,429
I cannot compare to cannot predict so

614
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,590
for example when I predict the code the

615
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:35,450
salary divided by the total compensation

616
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:39,980
ratio the actual value is 60% when I try

617
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:42,470
to do the prediction is 55.7% and that

618
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,290
difference of 4.3%

619
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,840
we'll be your error okay okay so how

620
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,830
good is this model if we can have a

621
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,570
smaller error the normal dosage

622
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:57,230
conception okay okay so this is our main

623
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,490
model

624
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,830
so preach is just a dummy variable so

625
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:07,220
when the firm has a reported data breach

626
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:10,550
in the following two years okay based on

627
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,880
this vio information okay we try to have

628
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,770
one year in two year but we notice that

629
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,590
it's really hard for us to define that

630
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,110
what is the first year because the CIO

631
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,300
information is based on the reports that

632
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,240
we can collect but the breach may

633
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,710
happened around the reporting time or

634
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,110
may be really far away from the

635
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,210
reporting time okay so that's why we

636
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,399
decide that we'll just take those years

637
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:38,270
into account okay

638
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,320
so we have a risk aversion level we have

639
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:46,129
whether the CIO is also the director we

640
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,320
have the CEO risk aversion level okay

641
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:53,720
then we have a lot of things that may

642
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:56,030
also affect the bridge company size okay

643
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,030
so someone argued that when the company

644
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:02,660
is larger it's easier for the company to

645
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,520
be the target okay there's also some

646
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,530
arguments saying that if the company is

647
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,260
larger the company may have a better

648
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,480
mechanism or governance structure so

649
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,960
it's less likely to have the bridge okay

650
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,590
but we don't know that someone argued

651
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,220
that when you have the age of this top

652
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,689
management team okay then you may change

653
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,150
when your market to book value is

654
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,280
different the breach probability is

655
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,680
different because you focus more on the

656
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,720
intangibles compared to the tangible so

657
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,760
it's more like the high tech company the

658
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,360
same thing here for these R&D issues

659
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,480
here the same thing they say that okay

660
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:45,080
when you have a higher leverage ratio

661
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:48,620
you may not have enough resources to do

662
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,980
investments or you may be limited for

663
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,050
size independent for size percentage

664
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,240
they say that it's part of your

665
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:59,080
governance structure

666
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,240
they are also represented represents the

667
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,980
coordination issues you have from the

668
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,320
directors okay director age you have the

669
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,409
directors gender someone says that if

670
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,889
you have more female on the directorship

671
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:16,659
then the management is better okay then

672
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,820
we also have different types of

673
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:21,429
industries financial institutions

674
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,760
whether you're high growth or low growth

675
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,500
you are in a highly litigation industry

676
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,289
that means you have a lot of these kind

677
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,630
of litigation issues in the past

678
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:35,379
high-tech companies or not whether

679
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:39,159
there's any yearly effects across all

680
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,230
the time period we have here okay so

681
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,809
based on what we are trying to do we

682
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:48,490
collect everything that we can have from

683
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:50,590
2003 to 2015 okay so we have all the

684
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,649
executive information and compensation

685
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:56,260
from a database called exec you come ok

686
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:59,649
all the firm characteristics are from

687
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,919
computed ok in board directorship data

688
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:06,939
or in the past it's called risk metrics

689
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:10,450
and now it's called ILS okay so this is

690
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,550
how it looks like so we have firm year

691
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,339
observations of two thousand and two

692
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,339
hundred CIOs with compensation

693
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:21,159
information okay so we have some missing

694
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:24,849
data so final simple we only have one

695
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:28,599
hundred and eleven hundred from your

696
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:32,260
observations so let me show you that one

697
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,530
of the breaches we collected so this is

698
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:39,070
something that we get it from the public

699
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:42,010
information so it made public the time

700
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:46,929
data security go public so February the

701
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:48,909
9th 2017 the companies are bees ok we

702
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:53,020
know the location is Atlanta Georgia

703
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:55,419
it's a hack okay type of corner

704
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,640
organization it can be a government

705
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,879
agency it can be a non-for-profit

706
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,098
this is for just a general business

707
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,500
operations and they say that there's a

708
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:07,599
loss of three hundred thirty five

709
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,390
thousand credit card and debit card

710
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,309
information

711
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:14,029
total records it's just three hundred

712
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:16,190
thirty five thousand okay so we collect

713
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:19,160
this one from the privacy rights

714
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,289
Clearing House okay so we just dumped

715
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,440
everything and we also have the

716
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:27,589
information from data loss database okay

717
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,880
so in order to make sure that we have

718
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:31,970
everything we want

719
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,819
we also search for all the news articles

720
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:38,919
we can see whether we meet any major

721
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:42,288
ones okay you can look at this one

722
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,999
reported breach by year for all these

723
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:49,849
public traded companies you can see that

724
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:54,109
when we try to include everything this

725
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:58,279
number is unbelievably small okay that

726
00:35:54,109 --> 00:36:00,980
means a company that is public traded we

727
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:03,170
have the CIO information we have the

728
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:07,670
compensation information we have the

729
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:10,549
firm characteristics we can only find 49

730
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:13,549
reported breaches in our sample all the

731
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:16,730
rest are no bridges no reported bridges

732
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:21,079
here okay or going to do a correction of

733
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:23,960
this one later okay if you look at this

734
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,390
by industry most of them are still in

735
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,749
the manufacturing industry okay about

736
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:32,569
half of them okay we have sound for the

737
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:35,118
wholesalers we have sound for financial

738
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:38,329
institutions we have some other business

739
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,489
services okay we have some high high

740
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:44,539
tech companies and IT services here as

741
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:46,789
well okay but I expected we don't have

742
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:48,230
much for agriculture firms and we don't

743
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:51,440
have anything for these minor things

744
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:56,269
right because information assets is not

745
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,970
a main thing here oops okay so we have

746
00:36:56,269 --> 00:37:03,529
the descriptive statistics that you can

747
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:06,019
take a look okay so I want to show you

748
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:08,450
this one okay so the company size on

749
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:12,589
average is about seven billion dollars

750
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:16,549
after the logarithm transformation okay

751
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:19,759
our MD this is the percentage so it's

752
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:21,240
about five percent of your total sales

753
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:25,830
revenue

754
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:29,720
okay bore size on average you have my

755
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:32,700
people on the board okay it's expected

756
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,839
independent board director size on

757
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:40,140
average about 78% of the board are

758
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:43,680
independent okay and we have this

759
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:47,940
director tenure eight years age it's 61

760
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,609
years old okay but you can see that even

761
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:55,290
the media needs about 61 years old so

762
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:57,210
it's really close and we also do a test

763
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:01,080
about see whether they are really

764
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:04,320
different between men bridge firms or

765
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,960
there's no reported bridge firms and the

766
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,570
reported as bridge firms you can see

767
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,680
that a version level is totally

768
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:16,680
different here okay and whether the CIO

769
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,190
is also the director is different the

770
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,220
company size is also different okay

771
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:26,280
R&D level is also different so this two

772
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,189
group of people are basically there are

773
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:34,200
two different groups of companies okay

774
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:36,600
and in order to justify a guy on explain

775
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,089
how many all the sample size for all

776
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:45,600
those tiny chance here oh yeah all the

777
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:47,520
sample size for all this okay so it's 1

778
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,480
over positive or is it negative and

779
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,750
records we have some more missing values

780
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,590
so that's why all record is are those

781
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:02,430
like company yes okay for them even

782
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:04,230
observations okay the first thing we

783
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,810
want to do is do you remember that we

784
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,600
say that a professional article says

785
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,440
that CIOs are getting more and more

786
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,200
risk-averse

787
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,500
across time and it has nothing to do

788
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,319
with economic conditions so that's the

789
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,370
first thing we want to look at it this

790
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,920
line here is the risk aversion level

791
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:29,400
based on our estimation so you can see

792
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,650
there is some kind of fluctuation ok but

793
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,990
this is probably the reason why there's

794
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,890
an article saying that is dropping they

795
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,669
are getting more

796
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:41,940
more risk-averse okay but it comes back

797
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:45,660
and he goes down again so overall if you

798
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,329
draw a trendline here okay this value is

799
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:51,328
getting smaller and smaller so they are

800
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:55,109
getting more and more risk-averse okay

801
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:58,140
so that trend is correct if you look at

802
00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:00,930
this line up here and look like this one

803
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:04,109
here it's more like they are perfectly

804
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:07,859
complement to each other so when the CIO

805
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:09,660
is getting less less risk-averse a more

806
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:12,269
risk-averse and then we have fewer

807
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,118
bridges or the other way around so we

808
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:16,890
can see that when there is a damp here

809
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,750
then you will see a peak down here when

810
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,990
you see there's a valley here then you

811
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:24,390
will see a picture okay so this gives us

812
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,169
some kind of intuition about what's

813
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:31,288
going on across time okay but if you

814
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:36,029
look at this regression results overall

815
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:39,359
when the CIO is more risk-averse there

816
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:42,900
are less likely to have security breach

817
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,420
incidents so this confirms our argument

818
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,900
the second one when there are more

819
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,450
risk-averse to try to protect everything

820
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,789
so the main issue becomes that it's not

821
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:57,839
in our scope but the main issue becomes

822
00:40:53,789 --> 00:41:00,089
that when there are so risk-averse the

823
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,369
IT investments or the investment on

824
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:05,490
information security will probably be

825
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:07,500
quite inefficient there will be the

826
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,410
bigger issue here right because you

827
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:16,410
spent too many resources on things that

828
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:21,538
that are not deaf valuable okay and when

829
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:24,299
the CIO is also the director okay and is

830
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,160
also has a risk aversion level here when

831
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:30,869
we look at the interaction term here

832
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,779
this one suggests that when the CIO is

833
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:37,500
the director compared to the case when

834
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:41,039
the CIO is not the director the results

835
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,970
is getting stronger okay so that means

836
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:48,260
when the CL is that a strategic position

837
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:52,100
it has the power to amplify that in

838
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:56,450
in terms of his or her personality okay

839
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:59,299
and how about this one oops when I look

840
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:02,419
at the risk-taking CEOs in the

841
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,780
risk-averse CEOs you can see that we

842
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,840
only see a result here

843
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:11,330
okay this looks quite contradictory to

844
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,540
our intuition right because we say that

845
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,160
probably they will have a bigger impact

846
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,850
because both of them are more

847
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,899
risk-averse but actually it's not okay

848
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:30,100
so when you have a risk-averse CEOs the

849
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:33,470
results it's only on this side okay

850
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:38,089
meaning that when you have a risk of our

851
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:40,910
CEOs it's not really about investment

852
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,950
issues it's also about protections and

853
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,868
whether this protection about

854
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:48,500
information assets or these kind of

855
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:51,290
investments can be consistent with the

856
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,830
CIOs decision based on his or her risk

857
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:57,950
profile okay so when you have a

858
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:01,160
risk-taking CEOs then the story is

859
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:04,730
different okay and we have some

860
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,310
additional results we try to decompose

861
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:10,790
the breaching two different things okay

862
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:15,799
this one shows that when you have a

863
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:19,250
risk-averse CIOs we only see that result

864
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,830
for internal breaches that means someone

865
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:25,400
has access to your system or is

866
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:29,569
affiliated okay so for example your

867
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,660
contractor your employees okay so that

868
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:35,300
protection is good for these kind of

869
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,240
internal breaches so this one does not

870
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,920
really work for hackers activities okay

871
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,709
everything comes from outside the

872
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
company and this only works for digital

873
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,680
assets he has nothing to do with

874
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,379
physical things so this over protection

875
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,810
argument when you are going to lose your

876
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,550
hard drive you take your laptop to

877
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,200
Starbucks and you just put it there and

878
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,810
then you forgot to bring it back with

879
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,450
you all these kind of physical things

880
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:05,410
cannot be protected

881
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:08,618
that's expected and we did some

882
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:11,470
robustness tests here the first thing we

883
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:14,470
did is the rare event correction if you

884
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,660
can recall that because of our simple

885
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:20,230
selection process we end up with a

886
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:23,348
really really tiny amount of companies

887
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:26,319
with information security breaches okay

888
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:29,559
that might cause some problems because

889
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:33,220
that it's more like a fraud case you

890
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:36,819
have a tiny portion of this event group

891
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:40,359
that can be picked okay so there's a

892
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:42,640
correction techniques that we use the

893
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:46,119
developed world from Harvard professor

894
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,259
so we just use it so basically this rare

895
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:53,980
event correction process is more like

896
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:56,230
the algorithm will try to recompute the

897
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,230
distribution or the weight between the

898
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:02,079
event group and the control group okay

899
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:04,809
so this kind of methods has been used in

900
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,480
those natural disasters earthquakes so

901
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:11,020
as you can expect it we try not to have

902
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,000
a lot of natural disasters right okay or

903
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,140
has been used for those Cancer Research

904
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,819
because it's rare rare it relatively

905
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:22,058
okay and our resort remain quite similar

906
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:26,290
we also try to look at this cio power

907
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:29,530
here because when we search for this CIO

908
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:32,558
position we notice that a lot of CIOs

909
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:36,309
are not just the aisles it can be the CL

910
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:39,099
with the chief operating officer or I'm

911
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:42,369
the CIO and I'm also the chief marketing

912
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:44,349
strategy person okay or I'm the CL but

913
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:47,140
I'm also related to the manufacturing

914
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:50,680
processes okay so we are trying to see

915
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:53,348
that when this CIO is not just pure IT

916
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,210
person when this y'all need to get

917
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,180
involving a lot of different functions

918
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,490
or operations of the companies where

919
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:03,399
there are results will still hold okay

920
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:06,549
and we show that when a CL has multiple

921
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,160
functions and that's the time we can see

922
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:12,190
these results so it's more like my a key

923
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,470
investment decisions now I can consider

924
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,330
all other functions into account not

925
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:19,540
just myself

926
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:21,880
okay so overall this is our our basic

927
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,810
test or initial results so we try to

928
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:28,630
show that when a CIO is - risk-averse

929
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,549
it's more like the fear is more likely

930
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,710
to over protect the information assets

931
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,470
so there may be other issues of our

932
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:37,900
investment in efficiencies okay and

933
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:41,319
their interaction between the CIOs in

934
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,550
the CEOs may also affect the results so

935
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,540
whether they are both through its

936
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:48,820
conversion or one is really risk has a

937
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,710
really high risk appetite it's not

938
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:53,710
totally risk-averse but the other one is

939
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:56,109
to the other extreme okay and the last

940
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:59,020
thing is that when the CIO has a bigger

941
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,359
power has is more impactful in the

942
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,420
company his personality or his

943
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:07,840
investment decisions will have a bigger

944
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:12,910
impact is different okay so that's

945
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:16,060
basically all we have so far okay and

946
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:22,118
thank you for all the comments do you

947
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:24,820
have any other questions suggestions um

948
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,650
going back to your main model it was

949
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,660
there any certain variables that are not

950
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,910
I mean relevant for that model or

951
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:41,670
because it seems like a lot of variables

952
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:45,670
you were dealing with yeah so this yeah

953
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:48,099
almost so this director age is gender

954
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,260
your tenure issue or all fall to be

955
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:53,020
correlated and associate okay and

956
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,630
actually we didn't ask one thing that is

957
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,359
in the literature they say that this is

958
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:01,780
shouldn't be a linear model okay you say

959
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:04,569
that because the tenure is not like when

960
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:06,520
you have a smaller amount but when you

961
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,170
have a smaller experience with this a

962
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,750
company or when you have a long

963
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,670
experience with this company they say

964
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:17,020
there is not a linear relationship with

965
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:18,869
bridge they say should be a parable hour

966
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,820
it should be a nonlinear relationship

967
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:23,859
because when you are younger when you're

968
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:27,160
older it doesn't make sense it's more

969
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:28,430
like whether you change to a certain

970
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
point then your

971
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:33,500
have to may change to another direction

972
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,480
right so in this case we may need to do

973
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,270
something else with this model sentence

974
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,270
yep one more question why didn't you

975
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:43,790
include any like decision um like

976
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:46,850
metrics or anything or like personality

977
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:50,410
variables in your model yeah we are

978
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:54,380
trying to do that we're collecting

979
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:57,200
education experience those things do we

980
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,870
end up with only one year of we can only

981
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,210
get one year of the data you know so

982
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,670
we're trying to search backwards but it

983
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:07,450
takes some time to get everything so

984
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:14,270
yeah but that's a good suggestion to use

985
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:17,560
okay other comments okay so thank you

986
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,560
for coming in your suggestions

987
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,759
you
