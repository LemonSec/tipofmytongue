1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,770
good afternoon we'll get started here

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,469
and it's my pleasure to introduce Neil

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,690
Cassidy Neal Cassady is from rolls-royce

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,789
and he is responsible globally for IT

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,198
and information security prior to

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,539
joining rolls-royce he was deputy

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,580
director of operations for cert UK the

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,640
national computer emergency response

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,229
team in that role at cert UK Neil was

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,179
responsible for cyber incident handling

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,980
across the UK critical national

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,860
infrastructure as well as being

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,840
responsible for situational awareness he

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,940
brings a wealth of experience at in his

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,350
role as director of IT security at

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,030
rolls-royce and he'll speak with us

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,030
today about cybersecurity and large

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,710
complex operations he probably wins the

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,600
award for the speaker who's traveled the

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,670
farthest having come from England to

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,289
meet with us today so I appreciate i'll

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,340
be making it through the snow today in

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,019
joining us so so Neil thank you well

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,079
that's that's very my introduction bit

25
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:06,780
when I was going to talk about myself

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:11,600
but yes where to start first thing I do

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,479
need to point out is we don't make cars

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,860
so it it sounds silly but when we

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,509
generally have to start presentation

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,520
through this and there's a couple of

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,329
colleagues at the back one of which was

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,048
in bit invited to am invited to a day

33
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,179
Aston Martin digger any fantastic return

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,299
up play the cars tend to be James Bond

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,360
and turned up and all the other

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,070
companies there were Mercedes Toyota and

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,659
then kind of this they go around the

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,789
table introducing themselves he kind of

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,259
realized that they've invited the wrong

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,350
rolls-royce to the day so we don't make

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,149
cars I was going to talk a little bad

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,479
about what we what we actually do with

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,719
involves risk because and rolls-royce is

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,340
very well known for its engines and for

45
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,960
civil aerospace engines and defense but

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,970
we also have some other interesting

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,829
parts of our business power systems make

48
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:15,260
diesel engines lots of diesel engines

49
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,140
from anything from Russian oligarchs

50
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,989
superyachts through to

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,279
power in half the Chinese submarine

52
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:29,080
fleet so quite a wide range of both

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,630
civil and military diesel engines a

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,850
marine business and is kind of based out

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:40,400
of Norway it and we do everything bar

56
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,650
build ships so we will design them we

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,730
design and manufacture most of the deck

58
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,050
equipment on them as well and we'll talk

59
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,090
a little bit more about some of the

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,950
areas some of these areas a little bit

61
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,730
later in terms of where they're going

62
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,010
and the the issues that it brings for

63
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,970
cyber security and having to protect the

64
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,100
data and there we also have a nuclear

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:09,320
business which is split into two we

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:13,430
provide a lot of components and services

67
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:17,180
into civil nuclear power stations as

68
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:20,209
well as building nuclear power plants

69
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,299
for submarines which is a fairly

70
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:27,530
sensitive area so we do quite a lot it's

71
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:30,799
more than just and the engines that take

72
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,170
us all on all day and every year and the

73
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,970
the engines that sit in the back of fast

74
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,940
jets so it's a quite a wide and varied

75
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,560
company in terms of the scale of the

76
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,440
estate there were some things on here

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,260
that for the cybersecurity point if you

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,829
generally scare me scare me witless to

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,290
be honest it's things like there are a

80
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,239
hundred and five plus third-party

81
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,670
connections into our network the plus

82
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,760
tells me we probably don't know exactly

83
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,000
how many which is a concern in itself

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,890
but it's a large global network it's got

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,630
over well over 50,000 users if you

86
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,720
include all our contractors would

87
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:16,969
probably up to nearly 70,000 people

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,640
globally we have offices in around 50

89
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,739
countries we operate out of 120 odd

90
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,719
countries so largely if you consider

91
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,120
every time a plane lands we probably

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,600
have some people on the ground able to

93
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,280
service it they need access to the data

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,810
and somehow we need to provide it to

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,030
them which can be a real challenge we've

96
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,320
got five thousand applications that sit

97
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,750
on our network to support the

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,340
engineering activities that we do the

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,720
application rationalization work that's

100
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,460
been going on has brought that down from

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,350
a rather impressive nine to ten thousand

102
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,169
just a couple of years ago down to a

103
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,280
modest 5,000 but that's still an awful

104
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,900
lot of applications out there but

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,090
interesting we still we only have three

106
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,409
and internet points of presence so

107
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,359
mostly things come in through one and

108
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,800
they go out through through which gives

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,000
us quite a good level of control over

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,870
ITA state so what do we need to protect

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,560
you'll be pleased to know I don't use

112
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,670
too many bullet points on slides what do

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,040
we need to protect a lot of excitement

114
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:28,100
of intellectual property within roles

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,450
and it's the key to the entire company

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,740
being right at the cutting edge of

117
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:39,440
engineering and manufacturing so that IP

118
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,820
is extremely precious to us a lot of

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,410
that information a lot of that IP is

120
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,690
also first human go into the defense

121
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,290
world is controlled data and whether

122
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,810
that protectively marked by a government

123
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:54,860
or whether it's export controlled or

124
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,680
itar control data that that gives us one

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,560
or two minor headaches and largely

126
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,940
because considerable time ago

127
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,770
rolls-royce decided that an engine with

128
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,969
an engine was an engineer we didn't

129
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,770
matter what it was application was so

130
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,410
all the backend manufacturing is all

131
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,630
mixed up so we mix up or a lot of for

132
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,210
the aerospace side of Defense and civil

133
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,770
we mix up all of the kind of

134
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,840
manufacturing process in the data at the

135
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,859
back end which causes huge amounts of

136
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
problems when you're dealing with

137
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,710
controlled data and the access control

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:32,169
that goes needs to go around that so I p

139
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:35,330
and the export control type data

140
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:38,810
manufacturing know how is another really

141
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,090
key piece of information for us some of

142
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,520
the IP that we generate quite frankly we

143
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,109
can barely make it so

144
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,849
good luck if somebody steals in attempts

145
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:53,979
to do it themselves but it's um that

146
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,419
manufacture we know how is extremely

147
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,340
important how you build some of the

148
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,799
things that we do know that the fan

149
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,039
blades on that the engine that's shown

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,419
there oh you're able to put a double

151
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,330
decker bus on the tip of one of those

152
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,490
fan blades and it will hold it and they

153
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,008
are we get caught of an inch thick of

154
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,770
those tiny things really but

155
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,210
spectacularly strong so how we build

156
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,770
those have a manufacturer how we put

157
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:22,349
them together the processes the quality

158
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:27,280
processes are all exceptionally strong

159
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:29,590
differentiated for us the other thing

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,940
that we need to protect really heavily

161
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,840
is our services now so in recent years

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,159
we've actually tipped over to be

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,289
probably about half of the revenues in

164
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:45,120
the company come from services rather

165
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:48,000
than original equipment manufacturing so

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,940
and it is a really interesting space and

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,969
because each individual bit of data is

168
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,190
largely worthless but when you put them

169
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:00,940
all together he suddenly has an

170
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,710
inordinately and that's that's something

171
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,719
it's quite hard to get the people who

172
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,060
work with this data and own the data to

173
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:10,960
really understand the value of what

174
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,930
they're handling on databases the

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,068
ability of a threat actor for example to

176
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:21,430
disrupt our supply operations and our

177
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,460
repair and overhaul / ations on the data

178
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,289
and services side is really strong we we

179
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,109
use and the business model for our

180
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:32,140
engines he's one of the business models

181
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,089
is very much around power by the hour

182
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,159
it's we get paid when the when the

183
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,890
things flying when it's on the ground we

184
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,539
get no money so that drives an entire

185
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:45,069
logistics train that will keep that

186
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,319
engine in the air so if you can disrupt

187
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,660
that if you can have people making bad

188
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,120
decisions about where they're going to

189
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,810
repair things where the aircraft need to

190
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,170
be in order to repair

191
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,160
then you could really disrupt help how

192
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:03,020
well thoughtless operates in its

193
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,219
profitability I said I talked about a

194
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,980
little bit about some of the future

195
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:13,910
things we marine business is very very

196
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,029
focused on autonomous shipping or ship

197
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,510
intelligence as i've called it there is

198
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:22,670
a video that the business showed me they

199
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,740
were very proud of this video and i

200
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,240
watched it and when the lights came up

201
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,790
they kind of started laughing because i

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,570
think i'd gone pale and started to shake

203
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:36,410
slightly and sweat a little bit and the

204
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,560
video involved having somebody who

205
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,779
quietly looked about 12 and swiping left

206
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,390
and right in a kind of a visual in a

207
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,700
virtual space and ships would change

208
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,470
course a majestically sail across the

209
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,140
ocean and if there was a problem that

210
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,700
send drones out to fix it and I kind of

211
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,029
SAT there thinking and you want me to

212
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,790
protect that seriously it's a two

213
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,710
hundred thousand ton kinetic weapon and

214
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,380
you've got a twelve-year-old swiping

215
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:06,770
left and right in virtual space to turn

216
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,750
it round oh really there may have been

217
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,439
some more interesting language used at

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,360
the time I suspect but that connected

219
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,730
piece is what's really important in

220
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,990
there and so we're starting to look at

221
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,520
how do we look at things from an

222
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,310
end-to-end perspective not just

223
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,290
individual components how could you

224
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,780
disrupt how could a threat out to come

225
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,180
in and disrupt that that entire

226
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:35,150
end-to-end operation from and all the

227
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:38,420
data links that going back and forth the

228
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,800
last one is really round as really hard

229
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,589
to do a presentation on cyber security

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,370
without mentioning cloud or IOT at some

231
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:48,589
point rolls-royce has been doing

232
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,040
internet of things since before it had a

233
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,740
really 20 titles for years we've been

234
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,349
taking information and data off the

235
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,870
engines when they land and feeding it

236
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,750
back across the internet so we can

237
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,920
analyze that data it's our own done of

238
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,490
peyote

239
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,899
and but that's growing massively the

240
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,310
amount of data that we take off engines

241
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,769
telemetry data whether it's diesel

242
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,469
engines or ever space ones is growing

243
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,240
growing and growing to the point of the

244
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,459
data itself starts to become interesting

245
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,620
because you can reverse engineer the

246
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,349
performance characteristics potentially

247
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:31,220
of that engine which is an interesting

248
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:33,470
thing to try and do but also and we run

249
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,829
a lot services off of that kind of IOT

250
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,639
thing aids it's just becoming huge and

251
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,529
we need to be able to check that and and

252
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,880
typically in that space and it all ends

253
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,600
up going into a cloud and they wanted to

254
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,199
Big Data solution we lose control and

255
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:54,920
it's just horrendous so you'll be aware

256
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:56,209
of all of these kind of things so I'm

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,189
going to talk a little bit about the

258
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:02,420
threats to the company and where we see

259
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:08,240
empty we see lots and lots of things in

260
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:11,360
the news around cyber attacks etc one of

261
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,519
the things entry if you talk to senior

262
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,290
people within companies is they see all

263
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,260
that stuff but they a they never think

264
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:25,579
it happens to them it always happens to

265
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:28,399
somebody else and and also the it just

266
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,829
doesn't seem real to them it it's not

267
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,269
something that I used to see and they

268
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:35,899
don't believe it I guys just newspaper

269
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:40,790
stories it's just made up but actually

270
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:43,640
and we see a lot of it we see a lot a

271
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,480
lot of very sophisticated at cyber

272
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,620
attacks on rolls-royce on a very very

273
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,620
regular basis yes

274
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,880
trying to achieve that reality

275
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,190
perspective you hear about the breaches

276
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,050
yeah but I think it's sometimes hard to

277
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:05,550
visualize the consequences any thing

278
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,650
you've seen that reflects the

279
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,530
consequences on companies going out of

280
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,000
business or the impact of propriety new

281
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,920
intellectual property being stolen I

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,250
mean any have you seen things on that at

283
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,430
all that you can share yeah I have I'm

284
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,370
just trying to work out how to share it

285
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:26,609
so I can I can it is extremely difficult

286
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,880
the consequences of losing losing data

287
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:32,130
and IP is extraordinarily difficult to

288
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,200
cost because ultimately it comes down to

289
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:38,939
a cost of the business whether it's a

290
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,460
cost now or a future costs and so really

291
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,790
really hard we've had to do it a couple

292
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,590
of times where we've played out a

293
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:54,800
scenario and then we've attempted to

294
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:58,410
cost it it's expensive it we looked at

295
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,400
let's take one of the snows we looked at

296
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:05,520
was and some some malware getting in so

297
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,699
something like cryptolocker arriving on

298
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,079
one of our core enterprise systems for

299
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,220
engineering which then makes it unusable

300
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,930
how long would it take us to get it back

301
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,030
up and running go restore from backup

302
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,829
this is going to take it's going to take

303
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,300
a number of days to identify how big the

304
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,830
problem is how it got in fix it clean it

305
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,329
restore from a backup get that working

306
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,370
get all the data back in it's going to

307
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,010
take as a minimum it's going to take a

308
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,530
number of weeks the cost of just a

309
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,750
couple of weeks of an outage of one of

310
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,079
our key systems we measured in hundreds

311
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:43,470
of millions of pounds of us have lost

312
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:46,710
well of cost I suspect is probably the

313
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,300
best way of pointing whether that's lost

314
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,160
revenue from not being able to ship

315
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,949
components or systems out the door

316
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,680
through to fines from customers for not

317
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,000
hitting order our targets so if you

318
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,640
start putting all of that together it

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,350
starts to become really expensive we

320
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,930
also do a longer-term one

321
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:11,940
on on I fall on IP theft and that

322
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,939
scenario played out over a much longer

323
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,880
period of time and that was measured in

324
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,220
billions of pounds sterling and so there

325
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,530
were big numbers when we did that he did

326
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,090
get quite a lot of attention from the

327
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:29,400
scene here broad members strangely and

328
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:33,210
it does focus the attention quite quite

329
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,760
strongly in that space we've also we've

330
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,220
also had experience with with

331
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,010
third-party companies and supporting

332
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,970
some of those when they've had breaches

333
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,550
and trying to understand how that's

334
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,650
damaged their company in revenues as

335
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,130
well which is a bit more difficult to

336
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,890
get into but does that kind of it does a

337
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,660
lot because a lot of what you see if you

338
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,250
do a casual search is the Pokemon

339
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,290
research where they have it down per

340
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,610
record but that doesn't tell you the

341
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,490
pain that you go through if you have an

342
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,410
intellectual prop property breach on the

343
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,980
phone on when we were costing those

344
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,230
particular as scenarios at the cost of

345
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,810
the cost of the bridge in terms of the

346
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,090
cleanup activities and the remediation

347
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,890
activities within the IT space was

348
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,110
discounted because it was so pitifully

349
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,180
small because I only really wanted to

350
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,470
deal with in large clumps us or 50

351
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,500
million plus one more question I'll be

352
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,090
quite a while and that is good so have

353
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,430
you had any luck finding insurance

354
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,470
companies cyber insurance companies that

355
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,770
would cover the bigger problems of the

356
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,640
intellectual property and the light

357
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:44,240
chain disruption we we haven't so I'm

358
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,460
I'm not a big fan of cyber insurance

359
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,890
papi I Marshall the corporate line is

360
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,510
but personally not a big fan of it it's

361
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,319
not something we've we've actively

362
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:59,189
pursued at all I always struggle with

363
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,830
the when would ever pay aspect you can

364
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,660
always find something that says okay

365
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,790
that's you didn't quite do that right

366
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,190
and therefore we're not paying out sorry

367
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:12,990
I struggle with it being true inside of

368
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:16,200
it what we do is essentially self-insure

369
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,299
by investing and we'd rather invest that

370
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,629
money in protecting

371
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,819
IP and our assets then the paying for

372
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:25,638
insurance I think it also has a tendency

373
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:28,128
to potentially drive the wrong behavior

374
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:29,719
as well so instead of actually

375
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:32,600
protecting the IP years ago I've got

376
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,179
insurance I'm fine I won't bother and

377
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:41,178
that's really that doesn't work for us

378
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:44,869
am so back to some about our threat

379
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,190
actors and one of the ones on here the

380
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:48,320
picture in the bottom left hand corner

381
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,730
is one of the things that does keep us

382
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,850
awake at night not that person

383
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:56,179
specifically but the insider threat i

384
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,689
SPECT he's huge for us if you are

385
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:02,330
operating 120 countries globally and it

386
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,249
becomes a major major issue and that's

387
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,739
something we're trying to start to

388
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,960
tackle a lot more and a lot stronger

389
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:13,700
over the next 12 months than we've been

390
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,859
doing if you if you've not seen the

391
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,659
pictures of the car and I we don't make

392
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:22,999
cars as I pointed out at the start but

393
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:25,700
the pictures of the cars ones they one's

394
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:28,999
a Range Rover may made in the UK and the

395
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,909
other ones a year a complete copy that

396
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:35,179
was I think he hit the market about a

397
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:40,090
month after the one from Range Rover

398
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:46,249
came out and strangely made in China and

399
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:48,799
so interesting interesting space I use

400
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:51,950
this chart quite a lot I apologize for

401
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,369
the slightly amateurish nature of some

402
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,600
of the slides and I don't well me a

403
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,730
corporate central function I'm not a

404
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,049
Salesman I don't have a glossy marketing

405
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,850
department was going to turn these into

406
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:06,168
a thing of beauty unfortunately the

407
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:10,519
things that I probably drew I use a

408
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:12,109
cycle a lot too just to help people

409
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,749
understand that the threat isn't the

410
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,639
same everywhere you go and how different

411
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:23,330
businesses are very different threat

412
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:26,508
profiles our our primary and our biggest

413
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,639
threat is we termination state but to be

414
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:31,909
honest it's a well-funded sophisticated

415
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:35,090
actor intent on economic espionage and

416
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:39,109
IP theft they are the ones that really

417
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,459
really am we're worried about you might

418
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,408
wonder why the arrows pointing sideways

419
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,200
which means it's not increasing we think

420
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:49,419
it's actually at a fairly straight level

421
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:55,879
at the moment it's because we have

422
00:19:49,419 --> 00:20:00,879
observed a leveling off or even a slight

423
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:05,178
reduction in attempted attacks since the

424
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:08,119
the UK China and the the us-china

425
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:11,749
economic espionage pack of just over a

426
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,908
year ago so it was it was an emotional

427
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:16,940
journey just to move the arrows from

428
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:22,429
pointing upwards to sideways but we got

429
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:24,049
there in the end so yeah nation-state

430
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,859
the advanced persistent threat which is

431
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:29,539
a terrible title but he's used a lot and

432
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,100
they are persistent they definitely

433
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:35,960
persist indefinitely playing the long

434
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:39,529
game we see them trying to trying to

435
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,570
probe try to test and all the different

436
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,070
parts of our business so they can get in

437
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,658
somewhere and then move laterally to

438
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,820
where they actually want to get to and

439
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,730
the particular bit of IP that that

440
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:54,399
factor groups after we've seen an awful

441
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:59,509
lot more in the last 12 to 18 months

442
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:02,869
with most maybe two years of attacks

443
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:05,440
against our supply chain some of those

444
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:10,699
attacks are very very sophisticated

445
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:13,129
where they will they we've seen them sit

446
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,859
on our supply chain looking at pattern

447
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:17,988
of life looking how we interact with our

448
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,668
supplier company and then they'll mimic

449
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,289
that and spoof it and send things across

450
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,359
with a bit of extra special sauce in the

451
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:26,330
back so some fairly sophisticated

452
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,980
attacks it's been it's been an

453
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,570
interesting interesting ride

454
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,279
organized crime is definitely on the

455
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,350
increase in a huge increase over the

456
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,019
last 12 months of organized crime

457
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,120
hitting us and it's becoming so much

458
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,440
more sophisticated it used to be

459
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,268
relatively straightforward you could

460
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,130
either block it you knew what it was you

461
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:48,730
can stop it running on endpoint all

462
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,159
works really well we will see a campaign

463
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,490
where we'll have hundreds if not

464
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,929
thousands of emails coming in and all

465
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,279
the malware is different ever so

466
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,639
slightly different on every single email

467
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,649
that comes in so it's impossible for any

468
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:05,529
of the traditional kind of indicator

469
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:12,340
based defenses to be effective in that

470
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:15,840
in that space a hacktivist community and

471
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,879
the people after that single issue not

472
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,110
not a massive massive concern for us

473
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:23,500
they don't tend to have very

474
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:25,000
sophisticated capabilities it's more of

475
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,230
a concern around defense and nuclear

476
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,110
which of the ones that people tend to

477
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,289
have a more ethical problem with those

478
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:37,090
those markets terrorism is an

479
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:39,190
interesting space we we are kind of

480
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,620
watching it very closely because the

481
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,500
capability of some of the terrorist

482
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:48,549
groups are although not fantastic at the

483
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,620
moment is improving and we're just kind

484
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,389
of watching where it goes and seeing how

485
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,090
that plays out at the moment but at the

486
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:57,279
moment we're not to Road and other kind

487
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,750
of point out before insider threats huge

488
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:04,330
and increasing and we're finding that

489
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:08,710
with those the insider threat from a

490
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,509
specific and malicious actor manifests

491
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,360
itself in a number of ways that could be

492
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:16,059
anything from them people buying the

493
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,279
real estate next door and then going

494
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,590
really traditional old-school as I would

495
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,409
call it and actually just trying to

496
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,408
subvert people to do that job for them

497
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,409
yes

498
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,760
if it's red it's high if it's green it's

499
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,560
kind of a low threat and then the

500
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,870
position of the arrow is whether we

501
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,310
think it's increasing or its could you

502
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:41,429
talk a little bit more about the supply

503
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:47,500
chain why it's not increasing or like oh

504
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:51,310
it's an issue in in this we is it it's a

505
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,320
good question we don't have a great site

506
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,070
of our supply chain like most people

507
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,750
don't you have a contractual

508
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,120
relationship with them so we see an

509
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,040
amount of stuff which kind of correlates

510
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,419
to what we see but we don't see

511
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,940
everything so it's really hard this is

512
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,880
just our assessment so it's very

513
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,020
difficult to have a sort of omnipresent

514
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,990
view of through exactly what is

515
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,710
happening we get bits and pieces we

516
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,990
don't think it's getting worse but it if

517
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:20,200
it probably peaked so it probably

518
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:24,820
changed about two years ago and if that

519
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,980
makes sense that's it as you do deal

520
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,129
with your partners let's click on a

521
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,490
supply chain how much are you able to

522
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,480
share in terms of different attacks that

523
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,800
each other tells you you knows

524
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,870
everyone's being full an open disclosure

525
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,110
and what's happened to us and they can

526
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:46,989
help you and good good question I'd love

527
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:48,879
to say yes and it's really really

528
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,480
difficult because nobody wants to report

529
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,270
this stuff nobody wants to be said put

530
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,140
the hand up and go yeah we do in trouble

531
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:03,430
so we don't get it it's definitely what

532
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:07,000
we're trying to do a lot more of we know

533
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,590
we need to do we are over the last 12

534
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,710
months we've started a program of work

535
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,280
to start looking at the security posture

536
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,820
of our supply chain so but it's a big

537
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,920
piece of work we've got fifteen thousand

538
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,730
companies in rolls-royce's supply chain

539
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,190
go globally we figured that was probably

540
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,770
too large number to hit like straight

541
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,900
out the box so we thought what this is a

542
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,420
good trick we'll find out which ones

543
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,100
have got the real high-end IP or the

544
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,840
protective marked material the export

545
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,000
control the stuff we really care about

546
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,470
I was hoping for a number around the 50

547
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,789
to 100 companies mark 1,700 companies

548
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:49,539
came back you have some very very

549
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:50,950
sensitive IP for us so we're trying to

550
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:54,669
work out how we actually deal with that

551
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,200
and but we've starting that process and

552
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,940
it's one of the things at sat at the

553
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,890
back one of one of the guys in the

554
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,289
rolls-royce team now looking slightly

555
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,960
embarrassed so you can tell which one it

556
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:10,990
is he's out ahead of our global security

557
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:13,480
operations so it's it's on his list of

558
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:16,840
things as to how we actually share what

559
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,320
we see without with our ecosystem both

560
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,850
partners suppliers and indeed customers

561
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,428
and if we're trying to look at ways we

562
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:34,120
can do that in an automated way in an

563
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:35,610
effective way so that kind of that was

564
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,678
trying to give a bit of an idea of the

565
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,719
landscape in which we're working and the

566
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,289
threat landscape and it's been it's been

567
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,470
challenging over the last few years so

568
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:52,510
we we've kind of developed a strategy

569
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:54,070
over the last over the last year which

570
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,408
has been really interesting to develop a

571
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,270
strategy that actually encompasses not

572
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,549
only the technology that we need to

573
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,789
support it across the estate but but

574
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:07,929
also the people that we need to recruit

575
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:11,169
the processes that we're going to we're

576
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:14,500
going to follow and the way we can need

577
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:16,480
the business to change and the way it

578
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,789
behaves and we've pulled all that

579
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,559
together in a strategy and this is what

580
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:21,879
we're going to do it's fantastic when

581
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,789
somebody comes to put pressure on your

582
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,970
budget to take some of it off because I

583
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:30,039
can turn around and say well like you

584
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,659
can you can reduce the budget but if I

585
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,850
don't do that then all the rest of this

586
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,230
falls apart now if you're if you're

587
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,520
really happy to go back and tell the

588
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,770
role voids board that you've just done

589
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,750
that then feel free at which point they

590
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,700
kind of go and look somewhere else to

591
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,520
shave some money off the budget which is

592
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,230
great but I wasn't actually the reason

593
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,290
for doing it

594
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,440
what we did in terms of them to develop

595
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:57,610
this we we kind of looked at the threat

596
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:01,570
landscape we've been through the threat

597
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:03,610
actors we know who they are the attack

598
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,290
sophistication is increasing we know

599
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,928
that we can see it we observe it we feel

600
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,850
it on some days our tax surface is

601
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,410
getting much much bigger so there's a

602
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,490
huge drive to reduce costs within

603
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:17,140
business the IT cost is huge certainly

604
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,990
within rolls-royce it is a very very

605
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:23,950
large number so there's a drive to use

606
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:27,280
more cloud-based services that

607
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:31,720
introduces just a almost an exponential

608
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,450
increase in your attack surface and the

609
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,750
more we link with other companies the

610
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,480
more we use collaborative tools to

611
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,030
increase productivity and the more our

612
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:48,220
attack surface increases and the more

613
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:52,149
sleepless nights I get to have so our

614
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:54,160
approach is kind of three-point really

615
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,510
one one is around visibility so we put

616
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,580
in a long for lot more tolling in place

617
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,190
to give us a visibility across our

618
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,689
network of what's happening and that's

619
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,059
really key because without that we're

620
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,970
completely blind and as to what's going

621
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:11,080
on enforcement there's a lot of noise on

622
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,400
big corporate estates we put we put some

623
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,320
new technology on the last couple of

624
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,840
months and we're finding all sorts of

625
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,750
things and generally speaking now for

626
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,959
legitimate youth although we did find

627
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,690
some password crackers on our network we

628
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,270
struggling to with the justification or

629
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,980
I forgot my password therefore I

630
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,840
downloaded a password cracker to me

631
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,580
could you just phone the helpdesk it

632
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,600
would have been much simpler so

633
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,189
enforcing the policy is a lot stronger

634
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,750
and it gets rid of a lot of the noise

635
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,120
and it means any of the anomalous

636
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,850
behavior we can start to see and it

637
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,489
stands out a little bit more an

638
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,230
intelligence we not only using external

639
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,929
intelligence whether they come from

640
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,210
government government agencies and or

641
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,520
from private companies who do research

642
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,309
in your space but also intelligence off

643
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,879
our own network and an understanding

644
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:03,300
what Google

645
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,930
like I understand what normal looks like

646
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:14,490
so we can see what abnormal looks like

647
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:16,390
and that's really important for us yes

648
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,430
can you talk a little bit more about

649
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,430
your enforcement policies and how does

650
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,260
is cause that a challenge indifferent I

651
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,210
guess because you guys are like so

652
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,790
diverse in different arm states and

653
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,340
countries how is that like the policies

654
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:35,710
of affected by these on different areas

655
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:40,590
um it's it's it's a it's a long and slow

656
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:43,770
process going through it most of the

657
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,990
regulatory stuff that we need to do and

658
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,840
he's reasonably well understood the

659
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,380
issues come when various countries bring

660
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,590
in some new legislation very quickly but

661
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:00,820
typically and we've a lot of those

662
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:02,169
countries have had almost clauses that

663
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,639
we'll talk around multinational

664
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,350
companies and saying if you're

665
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,110
multinational company you don't need to

666
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,959
comply with this which is extremely

667
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,209
useful so both Russia and China have

668
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,000
recently bought out new legislation

669
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:21,490
around private private data of Russian

670
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,380
and Chinese citizens and it has to be

671
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,750
stored in country I think we have a

672
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,360
global HR system is not stored in China

673
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,460
or Russia but actually there is a line

674
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,800
in there that says if you're a

675
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,190
multinational company that's okay you

676
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:40,899
can store it wherever you want so it's

677
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:44,020
not too bad at that level one of the

678
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,580
issues is when you start to enforce when

679
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,740
you start with technical enforcement in

680
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,149
place when you've had a policy for a

681
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,700
while but you've not been able to

682
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,670
technically enforce it and it could be

683
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,900
something really simple like only ever

684
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:01,990
use an encrypted USB stick the moment

685
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,610
you enforce it you'll find 15,000 people

686
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,730
screaming because they discovered that

687
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,830
they didn't have to have an encrypted

688
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,690
USB stick and therefore they've been

689
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,370
using and non-encrypted one for a long

690
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,299
time and he's got all their stuff on and

691
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,229
now it won't

692
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:19,929
work and they scream very loudly so we

693
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,519
have to the aim is not to break the

694
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,559
business and we still need the business

695
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,139
to operate so therefore we have to walk

696
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,720
very slowly through turning out that

697
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:39,519
enforcement dial up and making sure that

698
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:43,139
we're we protect we do similarly some of

699
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,139
these policies before you enforce them

700
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,820
we haven't had the capability to do that

701
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:51,908
now we are we are starting to with some

702
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,460
of the technology that we're putting in

703
00:32:51,909 --> 00:33:12,070
place so we can we can start to simulate

704
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:15,279
what changes all look like so like like

705
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,100
any any reasonably mature company in

706
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,999
this space we have a quite extensive

707
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,738
defense-in-depth model which in just the

708
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,690
technical side but also the education

709
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:28,509
programs the training and awareness

710
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:35,289
programs that staff as well as the

711
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:37,029
policy set and on the other side so some

712
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:39,789
of the things we work we're trying to do

713
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:42,669
a lot more compliance monitoring and

714
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:45,549
compliant style monitoring and we don't

715
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:47,169
do anywhere near enough of that which is

716
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:50,529
where a lot of the enforcement come from

717
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:54,129
and get in the the process is right

718
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:57,249
around that enforcement so enforcement

719
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:59,350
doesn't necessarily mean that you can't

720
00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:00,970
do something it might be actually we

721
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:03,730
inform somebody's line manager that they

722
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,649
do not doing something appropriate and

723
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,509
it's their job to then talk to them so

724
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:10,270
it could be as something as simple as

725
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:16,449
that we're investing in cyber analytics

726
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:18,549
platform we've we've kind of been using

727
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,689
a number of tools and it's quite

728
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:22,149
fragmented and we're trying to bring

729
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,399
that together into one place bringing

730
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:25,949
some analysts capability into

731
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,899
rolls-royce their overall

732
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:33,089
off so we can start to we can start to

733
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,560
be a bit more reactive in terms of

734
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:38,250
what's happening across the network but

735
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,070
also a lot more proactive in terms of

736
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,199
just looking for bad things that are

737
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:47,760
happening I'm we're looking for people

738
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:49,649
who are curious about just stuff that

739
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,820
happens on networks and goes I don't

740
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,679
like the look of that I'm going to spend

741
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,780
a day just trying to find out what's

742
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,680
going on and then giving them the tools

743
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,060
to be able to do that so that's that's

744
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,629
going to be an interesting journey for

745
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:07,980
us it also been able to do that means

746
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:11,190
and we start to be able to support some

747
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,980
of the non traditional IT areas of the

748
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:19,140
business so we we've been asked to

749
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:22,849
secure our our internet of things for

750
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:26,670
example well I've where'd you start

751
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:29,099
quite honestly but actually if I can get

752
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,869
them to produce data we can put it into

753
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,730
a cyber analytics platform we can

754
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:35,420
analyze it we can look for patterns we

755
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:40,400
can work it out so if I've got that on

756
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:43,440
where do I even start industry 4.0

757
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,280
activities that we're doing so trying to

758
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,670
improve our production lines in terms of

759
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,980
their efficiency so over the last year

760
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:56,670
we've had with our our civil large

761
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:59,460
engines we've had to go from producing

762
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,530
one a week 27 a week so in one a week to

763
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,750
one a day which is a huge increase in

764
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,880
tooling it's a huge increase in the

765
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,640
supply chain and because all these

766
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,990
engines are still made by hand and so

767
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,210
yeah so and they if you wanted to

768
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,069
include improve that throughput you want

769
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,480
to be able to analyze your your flow

770
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:23,400
lines in your factories and if you want

771
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,410
to do that typically people will plug it

772
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,030
into the internet stick it off to a

773
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,109
cloud analytics platform and play

774
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,640
because there are some really good tools

775
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:31,848
out there to do that but there were only

776
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,529
somebody else's cloud now the thought of

777
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:36,240
connecting out our production lines to

778
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,520
the internet does worry me quite a lot

779
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,330
you know it'd be very easy for somebody

780
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,700
then to start

781
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,930
off machine tooling on a production line

782
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,810
of bringing out production eyes to a

783
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:51,359
complete halt so how do I protect that

784
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:52,830
again one of the ways of finding out is

785
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,750
to start using our cyber analytics

786
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:58,259
platform to identify what we can and

787
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,880
can't do and also the containment part

788
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,760
of there is an incident in something

789
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,350
like that is completely different to

790
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,240
being in an IT incident so if there's if

791
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,560
there's a problem of somebody's laptop

792
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,220
we can pull them off the network it's

793
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,130
one person it makes no difference and if

794
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,359
that device is a piece of machine

795
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,010
tooling on a production line I can't

796
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,660
pull it off the network I can't stop it

797
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,340
because it could cost the company

798
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,799
absolutely hundreds of millions of

799
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,120
pounds so I need to better contain that

800
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,190
in a different way and deal with it when

801
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,990
I've got the suitable downtime in the

802
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,990
production run if that make sense

803
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,130
behavioral analysis is something we're

804
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:41,609
really pushing hit with this year we've

805
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:45,960
kind of dabbled a little bit over the

806
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:47,910
last year's with it but it's a it's a

807
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,980
really interesting space to some really

808
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:55,740
really cool tools out there and to go

809
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:59,070
play with we're looking at both the

810
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:03,990
network behavior and the user behavior

811
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:07,080
on this and user behaviour is extremely

812
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,609
interesting and I I've SAT through a

813
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,290
number of briefs rooms of Oxford

814
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,530
University when they do lots and lots of

815
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,850
work on inside a threat and how you

816
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,350
however what indicators you can look for

817
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:20,940
to identify when somebody's doing

818
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:22,970
something wrong on the network and it's

819
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,960
great but you can't do anything with it

820
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,620
you can't do anything with it until they

821
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,340
actually do something wrong otherwise

822
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,609
you're targeting individual ones the HR

823
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,900
function gets very upset with me so it's

824
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,430
a really interesting space but one we

825
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,030
we're really going to push on with this

826
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:44,899
year use of education awareness just

827
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:48,660
can't do enough it's the first line of

828
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,700
defense in any company I'd love to be

829
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,960
able to stand there when people say how

830
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,660
many people have you gotten the security

831
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,520
function

832
00:38:52,660 --> 00:39:00,118
about 55,000 unfortunately it's not

833
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,069
quite like that at the moment you know

834
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,950
fishing has been the number one vector

835
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:09,940
for for attacks for I don't know how

836
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:13,089
many years 15 20 since the internet

837
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:17,730
started I can't rave some and it doesn't

838
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:22,630
change because it it it focuses on and

839
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:25,809
our general what desire to help other

840
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:29,380
people so really easy to spoof and click

841
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:32,680
on the link and we've done quite a lot

842
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,630
with our and with our board as well so

843
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,240
we've been running exercises and so

844
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,250
cyber exercise with the board very

845
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,020
interesting when you start doing those

846
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,960
but so it's business continuity exercise

847
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,579
yes to some extent it is but it's a

848
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,630
really different one so most businesses

849
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:53,619
will have business continuity plans that

850
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,270
look at site individual sites you give

851
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,599
them a cyber attack that is cross-site

852
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:00,730
cross country in multi-country issues to

853
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,410
resolve suddenly all the existing plans

854
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:06,609
don't work anymore they just don't work

855
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,680
so we have to rethink how we actually

856
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:10,119
react and respond to those type of

857
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,629
incidence which has been really

858
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,950
interesting exercise so we we've been

859
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,150
sort of working our way down from the

860
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,770
top so we're going to exercise with the

861
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,920
board we're doing some of the leadership

862
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:23,130
teams within the operating divisions and

863
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,960
coming down and we're going to start to

864
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,579
run a lot a lot more communications out

865
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,890
with people and so they can understand

866
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,450
and staff can understand what we do as a

867
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,819
security function to protect them and

868
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,589
the kind of things that we see which

869
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:37,000
just and just keep drip feeding that

870
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:40,240
information you on a really regular

871
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,190
basis and supplier assurance is

872
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,848
something as well but we're that we're

873
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:50,140
really trying to do this year and which

874
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:53,160
I talked about earlier so I think that

875
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:56,750
was it it was a bit of a rattle through

876
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,299
so are there any other kind of questions

877
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:04,300
anybody's going yeah was wondering if

878
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:07,730
you have done any say analysis on the

879
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:10,490
during particular in financial crisis

880
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:13,280
how it affects the behavior or what

881
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,470
happens in one way or the other in the

882
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,840
cyber crime and the behavior of the

883
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,640
companies and individuals during the

884
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,080
financial crisis a particularly I don't

885
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,490
know if you had any data from 2008 I

886
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,200
think we would struggle to go back to

887
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:32,600
2009 to find some data it has to be said

888
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:39,020
you do get changes in behavior from

889
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:42,470
staff when various events happen it can

890
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,780
be quite predictable so when annual

891
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,970
reports come out and it's paid till I'm

892
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,410
and bonuses you know you know that

893
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:54,859
everyone's going to rush to particular

894
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:59,480
sites to look for information and we get

895
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:02,830
we get a lot of what we are guess we

896
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:07,760
observed that a lot of the threat actors

897
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:12,100
use events and press announcements to

898
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:16,490
craft their phishing emails into us so

899
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:18,290
if we and we regularly make big press

900
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:21,709
announcements at air shows or trade

901
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,500
shows about new deals being signed we

902
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:27,680
will then get a flood of campaigns that

903
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,600
will come in related to that you know a

904
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,640
big contract announcement with the

905
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:36,080
government will get a flood of campaigns

906
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,660
that are related to that and what we not

907
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:42,020
I don't think we quite at the point of

908
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,160
being able to predict that and then warm

909
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,520
people that that's likely to happen

910
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,140
unfortunately so i don't i don't know

911
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,160
how quickly good answered your question

912
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:55,339
but and no i mean because it is

913
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,509
completely unpredictable board say the

914
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,410
first one was long-term capital

915
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:03,440
management which was around 89 the year

916
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:06,259
99 and then it was just a small problem

917
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,570
comparing to whatever in 2008 and the

918
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,980
next one is probably the magnet is very

919
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,400
much much bigger

920
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:16,930
and then because of the money situation

921
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,609
but everything is right now most visual

922
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:22,279
how does affect the companies and their

923
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:24,319
relationship and sometime if they are

924
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:30,619
forced to do something maybe they don't

925
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,970
go bday enforcement and so if I mean all

926
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:36,140
companies when we went through the

927
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:39,049
financial crisis I'd a had to reduce

928
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:43,069
their costs in their cost base somewhere

929
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,359
so certainly within rolls-royce we've

930
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,090
been really good at trying to protect

931
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:51,049
the security side of it because of what

932
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:54,200
we do we thrive off the engineering in

933
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,490
the IP so we have to protect that and

934
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,649
that's driven all the way down from the

935
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,270
board so we don't see a huge from my

936
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,950
perspective we don't see a huge change

937
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:09,109
in behavior when things like that happen

938
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:10,399
around the world that make sense well

939
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:21,799
it's too complicated they don't

940
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:24,440
experience a their ideas and a

941
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,530
conclusion detection systems and sort of

942
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:32,390
select what different tools you're using

943
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:36,310
so can you talk about how accurate third

944
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:40,069
or they are all right now select the

945
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:42,020
creatures that occurred and where these

946
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,660
pistons able could detect them over

947
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:49,310
Europe so I cool how was the accuracy of

948
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:51,410
them and ask that it's almost an

949
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,820
impossible question so answer because we

950
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,080
don't know what we don't know so if it

951
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:58,850
misses something will never know it's

952
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:02,810
missed it no one beat is so like ignore

953
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:05,990
the beach happened by legged doing show

954
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:08,450
up on the idea so quite a good show up

955
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,759
it's because because of the light of

956
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:15,950
nature of what we've got we tend to find

957
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:18,050
it at some point at the very worst case

958
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,410
we will pick it and we'll pick up

959
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,310
malware when it tries to beacon out and

960
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:25,049
that's probably the latest point

961
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,630
we're comfortable so when you first

962
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,070
start speaking it out we will we've

963
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:34,260
pretty good at being able to identify it

964
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:36,510
and we can stop it at that point if it

965
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,850
gets further than that you into you into

966
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,350
a major incident and you probably

967
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:43,049
wouldn't want to kick out the bad guy

968
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:46,319
straight away and because I could be

969
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:50,490
quite dangerous but in terms of accuracy

970
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:53,240
of systems it's pretty good and you have

971
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:55,890
to balance it across the false positive

972
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,479
rate so you could detect everything but

973
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,180
your your operations team will do

974
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,550
nothing but triage false positives and

975
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,839
then they get really bored because i

976
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,840
doing too many false positive and they

977
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,430
miss one of the important ones so it's

978
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,750
getting that balance right and i do and

979
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,080
we've been with pretty good at it

980
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:18,330
actually and we don't missile we don't

981
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:20,100
miss lot he says we also use like I need

982
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,279
words or something of that sort but I i

983
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:26,850
crack that a constrictor I'll a cactus

984
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,580
and and we we don't actually we've been

985
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,750
we've been thinking about it and it's

986
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,310
kind of one of the things that quite

987
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,160
like to do but we don't quite got the

988
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:41,580
time to do it at the moment to some

989
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:43,319
extent we are a massive honeypot so you

990
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:47,220
know it's it's it's kind of interesting

991
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,800
the when we get you get the the

992
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:53,600
marketing field about you've got to

993
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:57,090
improve your cyber response capability

994
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,360
the industry average is 180 days or

995
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,680
whatever the latest figure is between

996
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,080
infection and containment or something

997
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:08,879
like that we do that in about three

998
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,009
hours globally so we'll have so between

999
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,320
something landing on our our network we

1000
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:16,680
can have it blocked and contained across

1001
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,570
the entire group within about three

1002
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,089
hours it has been as quick as 40 minutes

1003
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,680
I'm not entirely sure how we got it to

1004
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:27,890
40 minutes everyone just must have been

1005
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,890
looking at the right time on't everybody

1006
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,370
another cable Neela oh yeah quick

1007
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,100
question you mentioned a little bit ago

1008
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:40,580
that fishing is continues to be a huge

1009
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,410
error so I suspect I know part of the

1010
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,620
answer but I'd love clarification on are

1011
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:47,799
you guys addressing that through

1012
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,600
training or are you adjusting it through

1013
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,910
technical aspects as well to filter this

1014
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,740
and the reason i ask that is obviously

1015
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,960
it's a question that are a problem that

1016
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,569
everybody is dealing with but almost

1017
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,110
exactly nine and a half years ago from

1018
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:05,780
right now was our last rolls-royce guest

1019
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:10,820
speaker at the seminar and he gave the

1020
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:12,620
very first spell out spell out of oven

1021
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,110
of an attack that came through a fishing

1022
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,569
and just one of the very first detailed

1023
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:20,230
cases i heard about it and and since

1024
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:26,870
then you obviously hear about it daily

1025
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:28,700
so i'm all of those so we've we've got

1026
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:32,930
quite a good technical setup that will

1027
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,669
strip things out and we get around 90

1028
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:37,660
million emails delivered into

1029
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:42,820
rolls-royce every month we deliver about

1030
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:45,440
5 to 6 million on to the end user well

1031
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,150
something of that order of magnitude so

1032
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,670
that's how much stuff gets blocked and

1033
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:55,730
and dropped and some changes in in

1034
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,800
technology that we put in probably about

1035
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:01,520
this time last year so it's been running

1036
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:04,130
for about a year now we're doing a lot

1037
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,509
more we're picking up a lot more than we

1038
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,330
did before so a lot of stuff that would

1039
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:12,350
have come through and our old setup is

1040
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:16,640
now it's now blocked we're doing a lot

1041
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:19,100
on user education as well so when people

1042
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,560
join there's a mandated training course

1043
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,810
that part of it is not solely on fishing

1044
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:30,140
but part of it is around things to be

1045
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:33,560
aware we run and we run a kind of

1046
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:34,670
communication campaigns internally and

1047
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,049
the one thing i didn't really want to

1048
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,190
say just in case anybody else who works

1049
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,120
at rolls-royce we're about to start

1050
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,710
running internal phishing scams

1051
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,930
but I didn't want to say that just in

1052
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,000
case anybody sees this later on and then

1053
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,859
they're ready for it so that might spoil

1054
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,200
it so if you were to photo edit that bit

1055
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,150
out that'd be great have you done those

1056
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,819
in the past where you've we have done an

1057
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:56,400
internal yeah we've done them in the

1058
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,670
past and it was a quite a spectacularly

1059
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,270
high and click rate rather worryingly

1060
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:05,460
for a very poor email I would be

1061
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,800
interested I mean obviously will not do

1062
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,060
it in a public forum like this but other

1063
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,490
companies who have done this have

1064
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,230
reported that you know they give a they

1065
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,910
do those they find who are the offenders

1066
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,440
were they do a training they put out

1067
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,960
information they put the posters up

1068
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,520
around the company and six seven months

1069
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,150
later they do it and they find it's the

1070
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,890
same people able and so I'm I'm

1071
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,250
interested if you found a way to

1072
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,779
actually increase better response

1073
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,450
amongst the people you're trying to

1074
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,980
train your repeat offenders because it's

1075
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,919
not really question more of a comment I

1076
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,920
apologize we haven't because we have we

1077
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,740
we're not quite there yet and I do know

1078
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,860
of I do know of one company that has a

1079
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,500
bit of a five strikes and you're out so

1080
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,870
they run those scams internal scams and

1081
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,610
the first time you click on it you get

1082
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,500
the kind of don't do that again kind of

1083
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:58,200
message the second time it goes to a

1084
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,540
manager third time it's kind of a verbal

1085
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,549
warning for time it's a formal written

1086
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:07,370
warning in the fifth time is shown the

1087
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:09,390
door and that that can focus the mind

1088
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:15,000
possibly not where we will go with it

1089
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:16,529
but it's it's really it's really hard it

1090
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,380
would be nice to actually understand who

1091
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:21,660
that a certain individual have a greater

1092
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,610
propensity to click on click on links

1093
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,649
over there more helpful than others i

1094
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:32,790
click on nothing funny I think people

1095
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:34,860
think I'm very unhelpful so I there must

1096
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:37,050
be a way I think of being able to once

1097
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,310
you can identify those people is you can

1098
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:42,300
treat them slightly differently on the

1099
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:45,390
network so you may well have them in a

1100
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:48,360
more controlled group in terms of what

1101
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:50,460
they can browse the internet with so

1102
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,039
there are other ways you can you can

1103
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,539
encourage people for the right behavior

1104
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,719
which is actually you'd start taking

1105
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:58,919
some privilege often and that has added

1106
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:00,630
added benefits if you're if you're

1107
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:02,969
somebody's likely to click on a

1108
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:08,189
malicious link actually if you've got no

1109
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:28,829
internet access going anywhere so thank

1110
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:32,788
you okay cool thing else on detection on

1111
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:37,679
the production machinery not targeted

1112
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:40,380
attacks and we if we have an insert on

1113
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,809
there and we had I do recall one last

1114
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,969
year or any members found an awful lot

1115
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:47,459
of our that's been it that's been

1116
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:52,769
introduced by people passing data around

1117
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:55,558
using and USB sticks but we've not we've

1118
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:58,218
not observed anything so far and they're

1119
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:01,499
specifically targeted did you know of

1120
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:09,739
that I know I choose words very

1121
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:09,738
carefully cool

1122
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,919
you

1123
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,919
[Applause]

1124
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,279
you
