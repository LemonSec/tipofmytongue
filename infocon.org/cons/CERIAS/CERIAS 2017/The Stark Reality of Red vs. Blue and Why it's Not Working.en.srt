1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:15,090
good afternoon and welcome to another

2
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:17,970
security symposium or seminar and this

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,939
week we're really lucky to have Chris

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,710
Roberts Chris is well known in the

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,759
security community for a number of

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,039
things some some he will admit to some

7
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:32,460
he will not actually he'll admit to

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,739
probably most of them so if you look him

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,200
up on the web and you don't get him

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,309
confused with a video game designer

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,739
you'll find a number of interesting

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,459
stories but Chris has a background that

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,239
includes working and the commando and

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,510
British military as a award-winning

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,899
caber thrower and the Scotland games and

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,250
the Highland Games he's worked as a

17
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,980
security practitioner in this field for

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,890
quite some time gained some notoriety

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,080
for showing weaknesses in aviation

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,790
systems he has a record that goes back

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,920
in a number of ways he informed me that

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,170
I guess his first computer system was

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,930
confiscated by Scotland Yard because

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,729
he'd hacked into Barclays bank back in

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,729
the days of modems and he was in school

26
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,710
at the time he still shows a hearty

27
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,110
disrespect for some kinds of authority

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,780
and a really keen interest in security

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,539
he's acting as the chief security

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,850
architect for a Calvillo an up and

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,149
coming company in the security space and

32
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,298
he is going to share with us a lot of

33
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:42,270
information today and I hope you will

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,700
all appreciate that please join me in

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,699
welcoming Chris Roberts thank you

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,990
thanks guys everybody good

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,930
you guys will hear me at the back yep

38
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,490
good all right so it is gonna be

39
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,229
somewhat interactive feel free to ask

40
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,449
questions now we'll ask questions at the

41
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,539
end as well okay so we'll have a bit of

42
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,160
fun with the agenda we've got about a

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,070
hundred slides to get through in about

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,810
45 minutes so sit back pin your ears

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,359
back and have at it we're gonna go

46
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,830
through from soft red versus blue how

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,440
many of you guys are familiar with the

48
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,570
whole concept of red versus below

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,400
insecurity red team versus blue teaming

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,959
the whole concept of the insider guys

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,420
versus the guys on the outside with the

52
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,950
spandex and all the fun things we're

53
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,359
gonna have a talk about mentality reset

54
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,440
in other words what are we doing right

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,090
what are we doing wrong and what do we

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,030
need to change and then we'll have some

57
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:38,320
fun along the way to Professor smash

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,450
side of things come on in grab a seat to

59
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,920
his side of things um yeah I've been

60
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,839
doing this for rather more years than I

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,679
care to think off it's great for many

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
different reasons

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,120
got yelled at quite a few years ago for

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,160
messing around with Nigeria we hacked

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,330
back with the four one nine scams or the

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,650
whole bunch of money back into the US

67
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,239
and make a hold of the feds and went hi

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,209
we've got some money and it's not ours

69
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,380
to call some interesting questions

70
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,239
International Space Station was one Mars

71
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,359
rover we end up playing Freddie Mercury

72
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,070
god save the queen' on mars rover which

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,470
got us yelled at as well airplanes

74
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,420
trains and some other stuff and as it

75
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,030
was told I'm currently causing chaos and

76
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,760
mayhem at a Calvillo so what are we not

77
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,420
going to do we will not be doing death

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,890
by PowerPoint what are we gonna do we're

79
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,850
gonna be having a questions we're gonna

80
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,040
be seen dancing a whole bunch of

81
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,959
questions on why are we here what are we

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,780
doing how we trying to protect as you

83
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,760
guys come into the industry what are we

84
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,340
looking for what do you need to do

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,250
better than we did and part of it is our

86
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,480
friends the humans first statement on

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,780
this one for all that we are we're

88
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,609
having an equal capacity to evolve

89
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,340
that's a great opening statement when

90
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:50,650
you think about it we have the capacity

91
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,350
to evolve well it doesn't necessarily

92
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,150
mean that we are evolving as a society

93
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,030
when I have to put a sign that says

94
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,370
tweet after you've left the burning

95
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,890
building hold the chainsaw by the

96
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,099
right n and by the way don't molest the

97
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,708
crocodile when we have to put these

98
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,149
signs up to help people understand it's

99
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,420
arguable to say that we're not

100
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,010
necessarily evolving then you take

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,459
another step back and you do it purely

102
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:21,370
by the numbers by the metrics if we look

103
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,160
by 2020 how many connected people that

104
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,330
we will have on this planet of us you

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,460
would take a bit well about seven and a

106
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,948
half billion people but five and a half

107
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,989
billion or more will be connected you

108
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,940
take the standard bell curve the

109
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,050
organizations that have that says hi

110
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,370
here's the people will get a raise

111
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,110
here's the people that won't get a raise

112
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,970
and his people we're going to fire you

113
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,690
take that idea and apply to security

114
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,300
about 15% of that population will

115
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,520
understand or get security 70% we have

116
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,199
the Sheep oh I'm gonna follow everybody

117
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,650
else and 15% think that adding seven and

118
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,449
eight

119
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,909
to the end of their one through six is a

120
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,770
good security precaution and if we're

121
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,720
gonna do it right we'll put a nine and a

122
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,299
bloody exclamation mark and to hell with

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,250
anybody run all the math through the

124
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,510
system a twenty five million us a bit

125
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,150
about four and a half percent of the

126
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:13,990
population of flying around nine percent

127
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:17,229
of the population that we have will

128
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:21,460
understand or get security which leaves

129
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:26,440
us with the 91st percentile this is who

130
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:28,330
our audience is at times everybody read

131
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,979
it and understood why is put up there so

132
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,979
this is kind of what we think about it I

133
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,190
get to have a quick slope while you're

134
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,830
looking at that and this is why when we

135
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,949
look at the security industry as a whole

136
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,770
we've spent 25 years of beating people

137
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,840
up over passwords we have yelled we have

138
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,109
cajoled and this is where we still are

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,210
at left hand side we have the first top

140
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,550
20 passwords for one of the latest

141
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,409
break-ins that one we got passwords for

142
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,960
Forbes test one through three

143
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,970
Forbes one and welcome one are still

144
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,729
winning and then we take a look at the

145
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,320
healthcare data breaches and how many of

146
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,349
those have been taken out because of

147
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,390
just weak or loose passwords the last

148
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,330
set of statistics that are out there

149
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,080
Healthcare has lost about 680 to 700

150
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,669
million records so successfully they've

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,090
managed to lose everybody's record in

152
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,100
the US twice just to make sure that

153
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,030
we're all being good so this is kind of

154
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:35,050
where we are smart phones stupid people

155
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:36,669
ish but then you take a step back and go

156
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,960
let's take a look at the industry that

157
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,700
we have where are we as an industry the

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,950
organization so many companies are

159
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,090
standing I'm gonna I can solve computer

160
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,370
security we can look at all these

161
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,380
advanced persistent threats and I've got

162
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,200
the wonderful way of detecting zero days

163
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,230
when you go that 90 percent of greater

164
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,780
attacks are using known exploits who

165
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,040
gives a damn

166
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,570
abandoned advanced persistent threat or

167
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,280
a zero day when I can still break in

168
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:06,120
using passwords or defaults or

169
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,809
architecture that hasn't been secured

170
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,960
then you take a look at the

171
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,270
organization's themselves and you go how

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,200
many of them hang on a second squirrel

173
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:25,900
moment I got a DD I oh that's you guys

174
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,060
thank you a DD tape service as simple as

175
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,020
that

176
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,910
see you start taking a look at the

177
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,500
organization's you walk in full of them

178
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,480
and Vedran go haha I'm gonna solve your

179
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,550
security problems and they're like well

180
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,140
you know we'd love to think about

181
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,520
security but we haven't got our policies

182
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,669
in place or our procedures or our

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,950
controls so that's some of the basic

184
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,080
stuff then you take a look at IOT this

185
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,789
wonderful tsunami of technology there's

186
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,370
been engulfing us for the last couple of

187
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,830
years and how much crap is out there

188
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,780
that hasn't been fixed then you take a

189
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,300
look at us the guys that actually do the

190
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,070
breaking in and you start taking the

191
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,790
statistics on this one 81% of us can get

192
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,099
your data add inside the first 12 hours

193
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,950
which isn't good when the statistics say

194
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,010
the mean time to discovery is sitting

195
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:19,150
between about a hundred and forty to 200

196
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,490
days so not only have I taken your data

197
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,929
I've had the party I've sold it I've

198
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,240
probably bought and crashed the

199
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,300
Lamborghini with the damn data and

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,430
whatever I haven't done

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,870
that I be the sniff snorted or stuck

202
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,890
into the bank summer on the Caymans and

203
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:37,370
you still haven't seen me there he'll

204
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:42,740
chance do we have so where does that

205
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,990
leave the 9% how about there it's not

206
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,990
pretty

207
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:52,160
we throw some statistics out as well two

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,019
trillion a year to the economy so when

209
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,449
somebody says they can't measure

210
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:58,880
security or you can't measure the

211
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,800
effectiveness or the challenges of

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,600
security these are the kind of things

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,819
you can come up and say hey yes we can

214
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,190
we have a way of doing measurements we

215
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,399
have a way of building metrics the

216
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,130
people the identities the malware very

217
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,029
simple metrics for helping people

218
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,439
understand what's going on this is one I

219
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,839
throw up just in four here because it

220
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,089
makes makes life interesting I got a

221
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,019
daughter she got two daughters but and

222
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,160
all the one on the young girl and the

223
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,720
other one wants to go into the federal

224
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,969
authorities which scares the hell out of

225
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,810
me and the younger one can lockpick

226
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,860
faster than I can which is like yes and

227
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,209
here's the reason I'm teaching up

228
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,310
because basically so many people coming

229
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,170
up through schooling systems still

230
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,229
aren't being given the opportunity so

231
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,969
I'm being talked to about the security

232
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,160
around the eye tear on the whole areas

233
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,020
you guys are all here Purdue's changing

234
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,490
a lot of that but there's still a ton of

235
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:58,069
people now it isn't security as just a

236
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,130
traditional realm for having you in our

237
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,750
industry this whole challenge of

238
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,970
security and the problems we have is

239
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,410
everybody's problem I don't care if

240
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,970
you're going into engineering if you're

241
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,120
going into business management I don't

242
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:16,880
care what you are studying Security's

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,360
got to become all of our concerns so not

244
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,640
a problem

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,140
we got a cupboard I t's got this sorted

246
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,870
out here and no problem we got assorted

247
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,250
oh no we haven't

248
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,769
we're going about a million and a half

249
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,570
people short by 2020 so if you are

250
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,520
coming into our industry congratulations

251
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,100
welcome to our industry we bloody well

252
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,050
need you and we'd like it if you do a

253
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,050
better job than we did place as well

254
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:48,900
issues on implementing security

255
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,600
challenges around security 24% of

256
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:56,939
enterprises monitored their security 24

257
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:00,480
by 7 so that is a 76% of companies don't

258
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,290
even know if they're being hacked or

259
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,250
attacked or broken into how do we change

260
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,410
this paradigm so what's the summary well

261
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,279
we've got more toys we're putting out

262
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:16,380
there we're giving more technology to

263
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,500
more people who don't understand of the

264
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,480
technology or who don't necessarily

265
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,360
understand the implications of using

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,940
that technology we're putting more of

267
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,940
this damn stuff into our homes our lives

268
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,950
our cars our wearable technology all

269
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,080
these other devices that we're bringing

270
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,790
in we're doing more and more of this

271
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,050
well you don't have the in-house

272
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,370
knowledge to deal with it we sure as

273
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,779
heck doesn't have the outhouse knowledge

274
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,339
to deal with it and we don't have enough

275
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,870
people to deal with it and by the way

276
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,730
we're not actually watching the systems

277
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,810
that we're putting it into it's not

278
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,730
happy and by the way as security

279
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,310
professionals we still have to let you

280
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,620
actually get to your damn technology if

281
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,449
we had it our own way we'd lock it into

282
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,220
a little building with a man with a gun

283
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,240
on the front door of the building and

284
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,880
nobody would be allowed to get anywhere

285
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,010
near it which is perfect but then what

286
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,380
the hell uses it it's where we were 20

287
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,750
plus you know shoot 20 30 40 years ago

288
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,790
yeah scary that's where we were 40 years

289
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,380
ago we had a nice mainframe it was in a

290
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,020
really nice building and if you got too

291
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,150
close to it you got shot that was easy

292
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,740
that was good security but then we

293
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,520
started giving it to everybody else

294
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,620
which is where we lost it so how do we

295
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,500
break into you as a security

296
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,089
professional how easy and how quickly

297
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,540
let's see if we can break into you in

298
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:37,500
under two minutes we will give you an

299
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,839
employee portal because I'm nice because

300
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,150
I'm a good friendly normal human being

301
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,860
when we work with companies and we look

302
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,689
to do engineering and attacks against

303
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,430
tech companies we will put up a

304
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,110
healthcare portal because healthcare is

305
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,599
one of the more complex bloody things on

306
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,490
this planet so being nice caring people

307
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
that we are we will go out there

308
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,430
we will copy somebody's healthcare

309
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,510
website and we will put the company

310
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,760
we're attacking we'll put their logo

311
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,290
onto it and then because we're really

312
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,300
nice people we'll send an email to

313
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,890
everybody we possibly can send it to

314
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,469
inside the company going we're nice

315
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,939
people we're giving you health care help

316
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,110
and by the way because we're so nice

317
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,730
we've actually hooked it up to your

318
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,470
Active Directory which means you can use

319
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,480
your login credentials to get into it

320
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:22,500
without a problem no issues at all and

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,700
this is what the employee says and that

322
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,279
is our success rate I don't have to

323
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,250
break in when you give me the keys to

324
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,589
the kingdom you can put all of the

325
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,580
advance protections in place all of the

326
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:41,190
endpoint the IDS the IPS the DLP all of

327
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,880
the acronyms from hell that you want in

328
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,589
place but we the squishy thing that sits

329
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,040
between the keyboard and the chair is

330
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:53,760
still the most vulnerable so this is

331
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,770
about where we feel ah everybody good so

332
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,630
far yes got a quick question so I'm

333
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,370
curious to hear a little bit more

334
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:05,850
details on the phishing yeah so you know

335
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,209
what were these emails we sent from

336
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,240
within

337
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:11,430
no no but sent them from outside we sent

338
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,149
them from the website admin at you know

339
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,189
healthcare for United com click on

340
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,660
United because they're fun to pick on so

341
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,700
you know if I wanted to attack a

342
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,219
particular airline industry shall we say

343
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,899
I would harvest every single email it

344
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,430
could possibly find which let's face I

345
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,100
think one of the latest breaches came

346
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,479
out in the last couple of days when

347
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,450
somebody disclosed 711 million email

348
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,980
accounts so that's seven hundred and

349
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,170
eleven million emails that they've been

350
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,399
harvesting spam harvesting and in their

351
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,810
you know damn well there's going to be

352
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,339
say a couple of hundred or a couple of

353
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,329
thousand from that particular company

354
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,740
and then if you look at all the other

355
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:48,660
ones what you can by the list though

356
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,810
maybe I end up with three or four

357
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,540
thousand emails for say United now all I

358
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:58,199
do is I just craft an email from help

359
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,349
care or health care help at you know

360
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,030
United helping whatever comm and I send

361
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,450
it out and people go away

362
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:09,720
to help me login that's too easy

363
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:13,680
and that's just one you wanna get really

364
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,950
nasty you payload a PDF and you send it

365
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,719
to the legal side of the company it's a

366
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,870
PDF from the Department of Justice

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,100
they're going to open that like that and

368
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,350
then you'd pay loaded it now you got

369
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,760
shell on to the computer system it's too

370
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:33,870
easy to do to help on so that was cool

371
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:37,439
all right so Def Con this year 2017

372
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,630
celebrated 25 years of officially being

373
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,750
civilized security conferences that is

374
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,880
25 years we have stood on stage and we

375
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,090
have gone Hey look at the that we

376
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,670
can break and half the time it still

377
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,290
talks about passwords and every year we

378
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,030
pick somebody different to blame because

379
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,760
it's more fun we blame the users we

380
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,130
blame the managers will blame the CFO

381
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,700
the CEO the CXO the middle management

382
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,880
occasionally grandma gets blamed as well

383
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:08,670
we're very good at blaming everybody but

384
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,530
ourselves to some degree as it says on

385
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:16,319
here we kind of lost the data one it

386
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:19,500
left the green room so who should we

387
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,440
blame or to do that we have to pause for

388
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,660
a second then we have to get a little

389
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,640
introspective

390
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,300
we as an industry need to take a step

391
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,300
back and we really need to go hey we've

392
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,370
been so focused on breaking things we're

393
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,120
really good at standing up going hey io

394
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,030
T's are broken everything's broken we're

395
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,530
not so good really at turning around and

396
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:49,170
saying hey who are we protecting and why

397
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,680
are we protecting them we keep blaming

398
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,040
everybody keep taking a look at it and

399
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,750
going quite simply hey we can fix this

400
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,730
little bit of a problem or we can fix

401
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,770
this little bit of a problem and this I

402
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,380
think unfortunately is where we are as

403
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:12,060
an industry we have failed spectacularly

404
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,070
and we have failed because those of you

405
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,740
that are closer to school aids than I am

406
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,809
these days realize that red

407
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,339
the guy that can jump over walls and do

408
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,500
what he wants when he wants and how he

409
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,230
wants he's kind of like the schoolyard

410
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,109
bully he takes what he wants when he

411
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,140
wants with the red team nothing stops us

412
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:34,799
I've been doing this for 20 plus years

413
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,630
and in all that time I've yet to fail to

414
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,820
break into anything we've gone after and

415
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,460
that's government facilities that's

416
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,139
prisons we've broken into prisons we've

417
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,880
broken into all sorts of other fun and

418
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,409
interesting buildings and companies and

419
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,190
computer systems both here and abroad

420
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,570
that's not a good track record because I

421
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,270
really wish somebody would have stopped

422
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,039
us and then we're promoting with a liar

423
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,330
come and join a red team no quit that

424
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:04,710
 and arguably we've lost the core

425
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:08,668
focus of what we should be doing which

426
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,730
quite simply is protection it's as

427
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:14,640
simple as that I'll do a lot of work

428
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,679
with the National Guard and I often

429
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,980
refer to them as America's comfort

430
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,049
blanket because when goes wrong who

431
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,809
is it that comes to the rescue the

432
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,730
National Guard you don't see the FBI

433
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,899
guys going ah I've got two people over

434
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,870
my shoulders now I'm wading through

435
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:32,279
water he'll know who do you see you see

436
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,539
the bloody National Guard doing that

437
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,600
 what are they doing they're

438
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:41,960
protecting what do we not need we do not

439
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:44,760
need these people anymore why is that

440
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,880
this is a little harsh and I kind of

441
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,950
apologize but I can't don't apologize

442
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,399
but we spent him we spend billions

443
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,799
building on the misery of others we keep

444
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:58,889
finding things to break yet we don't

445
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,720
always come up with a fix so as you guys

446
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,720
come into this industry as you work

447
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,880
towards this industry stop saying hey I

448
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,770
broke this aren't I cool no you're not

449
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,049
cool anymore nonetheless you go hey I

450
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,690
broke this and by the way here's three

451
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:15,450
or four different ways you can fix it

452
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,260
you can implement the fixes you can help

453
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,260
fix things

454
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:27,850
kind of failed unfortunately and then to

455
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,610
the real logic really comes down to the

456
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,840
simple fact there's too much out there

457
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,179
these days and we're going to that a

458
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,159
little bit more detail and there's too

459
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,080
few people on the blue team side novel

460
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,970
as the defense team you get the

461
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,350
attackers ago how I broke everything I'm

462
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,360
the defenders going well for crying out

463
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,250
loud I don't have the tools I need I

464
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,260
don't have the training I need I don't

465
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,510

fix things when you get out there into

486
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,120

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,790
hi open the drawer taser game over

491
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,070
simple solution because unfortunately

492
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,600
what happens is you're like ah you got

493
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,159
broken into last week and you're on the

494
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,139
front page of The Times well if you have

495
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,050
ordered our products we would have

496
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,180
solved that for you that's not just a

497
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,850
Taser that's a Taser and potentially a

498
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,130
tar and feather moments as well there's

499
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,330
levels for this one so what do we do

500
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,100
about it well the blue team needs more

501
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,110
tools not necessarily tools from a

502
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,719
technical standpoint but they need more

503
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,280
help we call it a blue team playbook

504
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,450
actually working on how to do it now

505
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,910
though let's think of it as incident

506
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,430
response but its incident response to

507
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,350
cover all sorts of ideas concepts and

508
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,110
thoughts and everything else and we've

509
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,389
got to collaborate more effectively and

510
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,110
efficiently you guys are ready

511
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,200
University with what 40

512
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,659
people on freakin campus that's 40,000

513
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,640
people you can talk to and when

514
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,440
does hit the fan that's 40,000 different

515
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,890
people you can talk to him go hey we got

516
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,720
a problem

517
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,100
Plus apparently there's all sorts of

518
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,570
alumni and all sorts of other crazy

519
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,669
things going on worst case scenario I

520
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,480
pick up the phone to this map and go

521
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:56,299
shit's broken how do I fix it use the

522
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,160
network and collaborate more and the

523
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,110
call out to the agencies is the same

524
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,490
thing one of my biggest issues aside

525
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,389
from all the shenanigans with the feds

526
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,100
is typically it's a one-way street when

527
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,750
you go into the federal authorities and

528
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,040
go hey we've got a problem we got

529
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,900
something we want to work on they're

530
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,129
like ah great thanks for the Intel well

531
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,630
hey what do I get in return

532
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,330
well you've helped the federal

533
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,580
authorities who gives a seriously

534
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,040
give me something back I can use to help

535
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:28,668
my environment what's trending what's

536
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:30,139
happening what's going on so simple

537
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:34,070
question is it the death of the red team

538
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,510
no it's not we do need to keep the red

539
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,799
team's going why because we're going to

540
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,610
keep the vendors honest quite honestly

541
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,650
and we also basically need to help the

542
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,659
attackers the red team goes we change

543
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,100
our tactics on a very very very regular

544
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,470
basis so having friendly red teams that

545
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,090
collaborate with the blue teams will

546
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,929
help them get everybody get better air

547
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,240
faster we need to train train you guys

548
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,860
train everybody at some point in time I

549
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,419
would like to actually put my feet up

550
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,189
somewhere probably not on the beach but

551
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,990
probably on a mountain somewhere in the

552
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,090
vain hope the literacy doesn't go off

553
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,230
for one day that means you guys are

554
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,699
going to have to take over and

555
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,660
preferably do a better job than we did

556
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,910
so that's our job

557
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,340
train you and obviously somebody nice

558
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,940
keep an eye on the FBI that could be

559
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:23,959
your job too so what do we do about it

560
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,669
we have to change the mentality as you

561
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,440
guys come into the work force as you

562
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,809
work more effectively as you talk to

563
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,220
organizations I don't care what job you

564
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:37,010
do but put security in there somewhere

565
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,260
please put it as part of a software

566
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,879
development lifecycle model put it as

567
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,250
part of your building your architect

568
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,030
your environment and put it as part of

569
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,190
your mindset when you're downloading

570
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,370
when you're adding things start asking

571
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,470
that next question when somebody sends

572
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,010
you something ask of that next question

573
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:04,670
to yourself ask the family get people to

574
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:08,270
think about these things because if you

575
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:10,670
don't you still have people like me that

576
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,650
will tear all of the new shiny things to

577
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,940
pieces and we've been doing that which

578
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:20,030
is why we've got some slides in here all

579
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:24,920
about that so this is the other one as

580
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:26,990
well when you talk to the vendors the

581
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,600
suppliers and the partners when you guys

582
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:34,460
go out into industry ask more questions

583
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,189
that whole idea of trust is great and

584
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:41,510
it's amazing but don't do it and if you

585
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,370
do trust but verify when the vendor goes

586
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,010
are this year's blinky light is gonna

587
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,929
solve all the problems well bloody well

588
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,520
prove it it's part of the reason I'm

589
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,290
with the Calvillo it's for that exact

590
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,760
same reason because when they came to me

591
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,090
and said hey we've got this new toy I'm

592
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,610
like oh hell no you bloody well prove it

593
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,810
and so we spent six months beating the

594
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,490
living heck out of it to make it

595
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,679
something that it should be and now it

596
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,720
is what it needs to be but you guys are

597
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,950
gonna do the same thing same thing with

598
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,840
the blinky light cuz that isn't

599
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,720
gonna work because this is really the

600
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,250
reality of the blinky light this is

601
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,560
actually two engagements with my car

602
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,410
we've got a data center yeah that was

603
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,850
their data center and we're like I can't

604
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,320
break into that cuz I don't even know

605
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,340
what the hell I'll just take scissors to

606
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,679
the cables it's easier that way it's

607
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,169
horrible and it was scary so what do we

608
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,850
have to do there's a company many many

609
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,050
years ago called packets dawn they kept

610
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:40,159
it very very simple evolve or die

611
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:41,570
we have to get better arguably a lot of

612
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,880
the security tools out there these days

613
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,480
are what's known as reactive the

614
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,150
firewall Hey yeah I saw the packet I did

615
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,940
send it to Latvia was that ok that's

616
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,920
your firewall your ids/ips goes hey I

617
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,750
you know I saw the packet but I didn't

618
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,580
see it in any kind of these lists so I

619
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,890
let it go to Latvia as well do you mind

620
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,320
if I do that the deal

621
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,030
hey David leakage goes hey you know I

622
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,010
saw the packet and it was that she

623
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,350
wrapped up in something really cool it

624
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,930
was actually in you know a PNG file and

625
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,770
you let me send PNG files is that okay

626
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,410
that I sent it

627
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:18,350
this shit's reactive this is why we lose

628
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:21,560
all of our data so as you start looking

629
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,689
at this industry start realizing you

630
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,720
need to be more predictive stuff in

631
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,950
place and I'm not talking a I am machine

632
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,420
learning because we can have a really

633
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,710
good conversation about that by the way

634
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,140
anybody that comes to you and says err

635
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,180
we've got an AI system tazer them and

636
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,870
tar and feather them and stake them on

637
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,790
the ground yeah thank you yeah the

638
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:46,250
little red buggers as well place not the

639
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:48,649
nice ones God's help us learning

640
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,250
behavior the ability to build something

641
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:54,010
that is adaptive the tool that you buy

642
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:58,130
or the tool that you are developing

643
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:03,280
today still needs to work in five years

644
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:06,200
time architect your solutions that way

645
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,850
and it's got to be predictive and it's

646
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,380
also got to be intuitive the whole

647
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,300
concept of that to be building something

648
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,210
and then handing somebody a manual

649
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:18,350
that's that thick not good doesn't work

650
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:21,530
and by the way don't give people more

651
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,300
consoles they already have enough damn

652
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,860
consoles and they don't have enough time

653
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,600
to look at the consoles they have and

654
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,719
they don't have enough time to look at I

655
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,699
went round RSA this year to me RSA this

656
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,530
year was like RSA last year with more

657
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,290
blinky lights and more freaking consoles

658
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,810
end of RSA I just saved you about two

659
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,550
and a half thousand dollars on a ticket

660
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:45,740
because this is unfortunately where the

661
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:49,250
poor IT guy sits not enough hours in the

662
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,760
day and then let's talk about passwords

663
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:57,590
oh for crying out bloody loud all right

664
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:01,670
I have a t-shirt that's it's a hat as

665
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,679
well as says passwords and um I guess so

666
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,270
frustrated and so fed up and we still

667
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,740
break into places I've got a spreadsheet

668
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,650
so about three and a half four thousand

669
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,480
lines and it's all the defaults that

670
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,230
people leave on all of their software

671
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,970
and hardware like the I low cards route

672
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,040
Calvin still gets me into production

673
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,750
systems the hell does that tase of the

674
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,639
IT guy at that point in time or actually

675
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,559
tasered the bloody vendor for installing

676
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,460
it and not telling the company to change

677
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:30,668
the stupid thing it's so easy to do this

678
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,610
most of the organizations it's simple to

679
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:36,790
fix this stuff you know user education

680
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,110
let's stop making it so bloody easy one

681
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,668
of these days I'm going to back out over

682
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,360
this cable I'm gonna go ass over tip in

683
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:46,630
the middle right so let's summarize it

684
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,090
red team's quit the defaults quit the

685
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,030
hard-coded stuff and stop shared keys as

686
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,678
a blue team let's take less screens more

687
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,559
and less insecure ways to do things more

688
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:02,250
intuitive basically the whole idea here

689
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:04,450
is both teams need to work together

690
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,679
we're doing a lot to work with again the

691
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,940
National Guard and a bunch of other

692
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,440
folks with a like are we've got this

693
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,780
cool red team I might bring them into

694
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,059
the bloody building sit them down with

695
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,190
the blue team not on opposite sides of

696
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,910
the room but one red one blue one red

697
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,770
one blue you will collaborate so when

698
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,480
the red team guy goes hey I'm gonna drop

699
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,240
this new packet the blue team go and go

700
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,740
hang on a second yeah no I didn't see

701
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,600
that that's great and the red team logos

702
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,780
when I try now and you have this much

703
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,030
more interactive discussion at which

704
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,330
point guess what actually gets

705
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:41,530
fixed and things don't break as often

706
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,299
and people learn more effectively don't

707
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,620
get me wrong I enjoy capture the flag

708
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:47,650
and causing chaos and mayhem in the

709
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,659
world but I want to be able to feed that

710
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,580
data back to the blue team so they can

711
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,840
bloody well learn as to what's going on

712
00:29:51,580 --> 00:30:00,520
so why do we care why am i ranting about

713
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:03,250
this stuff this is why what we have now

714
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,889
is nothing to what is coming down the

715
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,120
line what do I mean by that I mean I'm

716
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:11,169
gonna take a quick loss of water while

717
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,500
you look at squirrels you guys have

718
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:17,140
heard of the whole IOT ecosphere yes

719
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,559
this is my slide about IOT it is

720
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,350
extremely illegible because there's so

721
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,450
much crap on it when we talk to people

722
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,389
about IOT when organizations think about

723
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,820
IOT it's this one little

724
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:32,339
up here personal devices through to may

725
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,918
be connected home what we tend to

726
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:41,279
figured about is the rest of the crap of

727
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:42,869
IOT and that's only the stuff now that

728
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,249
isn't the stuff that we're looking to

729
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,570
put in place and we're looking to build

730
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:47,459
then you look at the shared

731
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,439
architectures the shared software the

732
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:52,529
shared code and how much of it's not

733
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,089
secure and again we go back to the fact

734
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:55,259
there's not enough of us to fix it now

735
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,089
let alone what's coming down the line

736
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:00,239
then we take a look at the fin

737
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:02,309
text-based financial technology the

738
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,229
concept here is instead of you going

739
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:06,389
into a brick-and-mortar banking owner

740
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:08,039
I'm gonna give you my money you go onto

741
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:10,498
your phone and go I'm gonna give you my

742
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,629
money instead oh my god shoot the phone

743
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,169
and then when you've done shooting the

744
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:16,708
phone

745
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:20,339
taser half the FinTech companies we did

746
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:22,200
a study turning to 48 companies 3.4

747
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:26,940
billion dollars they've managed to get

748
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,879
funded 65 percent of them haven't done

749
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,379
the basic security testing so these are

750
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,820
companies going out going hey if you

751
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:34,139
want to buy a car and you want to buy a

752
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,820
house who you want to get alone we can

753
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,559
do all of this processing for you we'll

754
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,869
save you all the problems and hassles of

755
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,029
going into a bank give us all of your

756
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:46,139
information which you do and they

757
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:48,629
haven't got the basic fixed so we

758
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:50,579
have to do a better job of asking those

759
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:52,379
nasty or good questions of the companies

760
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,450
and if you're gonna go work for one of

761
00:31:52,379 --> 00:32:00,208
them you guys are gonna do a better job

762
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:02,039
of securing the damn stuff so before we

763
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,579
hit the panic button let us have some

764
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,749
fun

765
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:08,039
ah let's do what locomotives I'm not

766
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:13,229
allowed to talk about Airlines anymore

767
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:14,579
but I can talk about trains for any of

768
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:16,529
you that you want to have some fun just

769
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:19,799
google my name and United and then

770
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:22,829
giggle so we took a look at the

771
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,820
locomotive industry why cuz a they're

772
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:28,349
big B they're fun C as a kid I built one

773
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,939
of the stupid things and now I've got a

774
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:32,908
big one to play with that's actually

775
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,329
weighs several thousand tons and D you

776
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:38,849
can actually make them do that and the

777
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:41,070
other reason is they are one of the

778
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:44,070
integral parts of what's known as the

779
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,139
intermodal system in other words when

780
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,120
you go to the cafeteria in the Union and

781
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:50,008
you sit down and you get your food that

782
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,750
food at some point in time started

783
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,880
somewhere else it might have been on a

784
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,860
ship coming in from abroad it might have

785
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,130
been in the farm somewhere else it got

786
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,080
here by train if we can figure out how

787
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,200
to stop the trains all the sudden we

788
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,658
might get some people's attention oh

789
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,080
we're gonna get arrested again so what

790
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:13,110
do we do so this is a short couple of

791
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,418
slides based on an entire presentation

792
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,090
we did and we had some fun we basically

793
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,620
said let's set ourselves 48 hours what

794
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,019
can we do with the locomotive

795
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,029
environment inside 48 hours so this was

796
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,299
the tools that we used I would advocate

797
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:30,240
that you don't do this because you will

798
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,830
get yelled at but you can basically mess

799
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,659
around you've got some fun tools here by

800
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,189
the way please notice the extremely not

801
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,190
necessary one which is the good bottle

802
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,190
of single-malt always attack things with

803
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,750
single malt it makes life much easier

804
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,179
but this isn't heavy and hard stuff this

805
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,039
is not having zero day exploits this

806
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,139
isn't having to write crazy amounts of

807
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,870
code this is a couple of hundred foot of

808
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:55,168
cat 5 cable a whole bunch of research

809
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:59,459
and then some time to do a little bit of

810
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:02,279
work first we decided to take a look at

811
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,750
where the cargo was so if you want to

812
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,909
know where the cargo is this three

813
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,909
different organizations orb comb

814
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:10,770
transcurrent soft rail they run a whole

815
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,109
bunch of online systems those online

816
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,940
systems are basically web facing systems

817
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:16,949
with unfortunately very easy sequel

818
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,480
queries behind the scenes at which you

819
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:22,980
can ask them all sorts of nice equal

820
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,379
questions I get a simple answer this

821
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,629
basically shows you exactly where the

822
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:30,029
railyard is so there irelia - all dotted

823
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:32,879
around all the globe each one of these

824
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,889
is a different type of container some of

825
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,290
these are petroleum containers some of

826
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,329
them are operated by different companies

827
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,040
next one Northwest sudden one all the

828
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,589
different ones on here each one of these

829
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,819
has a bill of ladings so now if I want

830
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,250
to know where the train and the

831
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:48,719
locomotive is I can take a look at and

832
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,918
go hey I actually want to get a whole

833
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,408
bunch of these or a whole bunch of these

834
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,029
and mess with them easy stuff to do by

835
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,829
the way this was doing without login

836
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,630
credential

837
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:59,369
you can interrogate the entire system if

838
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,390
you know how to manipulate the web

839
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:05,730
browser which hopefully you do by now so

840
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,930
we can at least look at where the cargo

841
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:12,119
is well what are we doing--train

842
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:15,240
well we take a look at ge ge makes some

843
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,539
amazing trains ge doesn't do quite as

844
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:23,129
good a job with the passwords user ID GE

845
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:24,990
password six zeros not that hard to get

846
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,670
into especially when you start taking a

847
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,038
look at the GE trains that are not

848
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,480
necessarily in this country and you can

849
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,390
mess around the Q annex which is

850
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,130
basically a nice interface system we did

851
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,980
this live when we were in London earlier

852
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,569
this year we got into a train in China

853
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,010
now I go you can't do that so we did so

854
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,390
we telnet it in got a nice screen

855
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,619
console with a maintenance software it

856
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,750
took a screenshot of exactly what the

857
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,130
engine was doing in China took about 10

858
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,130
minutes and that was the user ID and

859
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,470
password to get into it easy stuff and

860
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,059
at this point in time I've got access to

861
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,740
this which means I can speed the train

862
00:35:54,059 --> 00:36:00,420
up or slow it down whatever I want to do

863
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,848
so that's fun can we do the same thing

864
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,809
in the u.s. well the answer is yes

865
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:08,910
because there's how you hack signals

866
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:10,829
that 200-foot a cable and three minutes

867
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,799
with a lockpick set gets you into a

868
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:15,510
wayside their dotted around there are

869
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,670
junctions there are intersections there

870
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,049
also if you go out to a nice middle of

871
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,730
nowhere we got about a hundred miles of

872
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:22,589
track that I bet every two to five miles

873
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,349
you can find one of these things if you

874
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:28,558
feel like getting access to one which I

875
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:30,539
probably wouldn't advise unless you have

876
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,450
a get-out-of-jail-free card you can plug

877
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:35,789
in get into them and with a very simple

878
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,140
Ge Ge you can get an access consult or

879
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,760
the damn thing if it doesn't give you an

880
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,680
IP address you can assign yourself that

881
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,569
IP address and just get Tellman all

882
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,799
server to it at which point now I can

883
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:45,210
actually get into the communication

884
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:47,910
equipment and I can pull off all the

885
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,010
waste site information so I've got two

886
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,879
one the question is can I get to all of

887
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:55,710
the others the answer of course is yes I

888
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,230
can actually take over at any one point

889
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:01,260
in time several hundred miles of track

890
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:04,710
at my discretion what can I do with it

891
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,310
well I can leave all the lights green I

892
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,110
can turn all the lights red

893
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,690
I can put the signal crossings up I can

894
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,400
put the signal crossings down I can do

895
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,900
whatever I want and the reason I can do

896
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,340
whatever I want is when the engineers

897
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,310
built this they didn't think about

898
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,950
security they put one button in there

899
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,120
this is called a man not present in

900
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,379
other words if I want to turn the

901
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,940
signals up and down and turn lights

902
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,160
green I have to press this one button

903
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,560
but that one button goes to a software

904
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,500
function that's on the board so all I

905
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,450
have to do is overflow that software

906
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,970
function and it defaults to what I want

907
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,560
it to so I basically do a

908
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,779
man-in-the-middle attack on an a player

909
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,220
and I basically do an attack on the

910
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,080
network leg combine those two together

911
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,750
and now I can actually take over pretty

912
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,569
much so any signal anywhere

913
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,370
unfortunately this is what happens how

914
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,580
many of you ride Amtrak or a ridden

915
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,930
Amtrak or the train system excellent

916
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,480
this is what you can do to Amtrak trains

917
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,770
to and track is currently running

918
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,120
shellshock on a whole bunch of there

919
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,140
aren't track systems probably not the

920
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,970
smartest thing to do

921
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,160
it also means when you're sitting

922
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,169
legally in the passenger compartment on

923
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,089
the passenger wireless network if you

924
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,820
run shellshock on the switches you can

925
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:16,820
basically get yourself onto the

926
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,590
locomotive network and from the

927
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,970
locomotive network you can actually if

928
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,520
you're running late speed the train up a

929
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,689
little bit and not have it stop at any

930
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,930
of the other cross since you get the

931
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:32,330
idea kind of a fun thing to do

932
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:35,029
everybody good so far all right

933
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:42,049
so we've had transportation let's have

934
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:43,550
some fun with food so in this case I'm

935
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,780
gonna mess with the UK the reason I'm

936
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,980
gonna mess with the UK is I have one

937
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,900
English and one Scottish side of a

938
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,100
family the Scottish side of the family

939
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,120
went for independence and we lost

940
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,670
because there are too many bloody

941
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,700
English people in Scotland so this is

942
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:58,130
revenge this is basically going after

943
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,689
the cows cuz cows are fun to break why a

944
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,550
cows went a great because they're part

945
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,860
of the food system and they're also fun

946
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:06,830
because you can do your own research

947
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:10,280
again as an attacker and as a defender

948
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:12,590
of organizations if you ignore what

949
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,900
Hollywood tells you you actually have to

950
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,000
do your own research this is how you do

951
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,860
it do your own open-source research do

952
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
your own intelligence research Google

953
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,450
the heck out of it

954
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,460
you show down use all the detail stuff

955
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,200
get out and understand what Turin onion

956
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,920
is there is a whole wealth of

957
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,779
information on there take a look at this

958
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,720
information Google yourself in the

959
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:38,060
middle scary at times

960
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,089
so rather than researching let's hack

961
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:44,320
something I'll let you read that for a

962
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,320
second while I take a quick look

963
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:55,430
everybody good

964
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:57,230
so this is hacking cows 101 cows have to

965
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,819
be milked on a regular basis and as

966
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,800
they're milking them the milk machines

967
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,250
especially the automated systems these

968
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,630
days can also measure the cows

969
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,280
biochemistry and everything else which

970
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,960
mean when the cow is being uttered up

971
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,700
and all sorts of milks been taken out

972
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,640
and then go ah the cow is feeling bad

973
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,189
let's fill it full of chemical crap

974
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,230
that's what this machine does the way

975
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,080
you get into these machines is using

976
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:23,270
terminal server or PC anywhere and as

977
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,759
it's the same password across the entire

978
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,440
herd management system you can get into

979
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,800
about quarter of a million cows in about

980
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,690
ten minutes flat so quarter million cows

981
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,910
with a whole bunch of systems I can now

982
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,760
not just measure the milk but using this

983
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:41,540
system and this one I can also adjust

984
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,190
the drugs that it's fed so number one I

985
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,600
can put drugs into the milk and number

986
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,650
two I can drug the cow up so you're

987
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,810
either going to end up with a really

988
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:51,650
happy hippie cow or I can kill the cow

989
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:55,130
and poison your milk that took about 48

990
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:58,940
hours to figure out as well and if that

991
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:01,880
wasn't enough you can war drive the

992
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,770
livestock for shared giggles so is

993
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,600
driving through Wyoming recently and I'm

994
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,380
like why the hell is my wireless system

995
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,360
going mad

996
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,950
who's going mad because the cows are

997
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,960
running pedometers on them

998
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,540
so they've got near-field communication

999
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,640
so herd management is a huge thing both

1000
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,320
from a costing feeding perspective and a

1001
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,060
whole bunch of other reasons which is

1002
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,890
great until you realize that the cow

1003
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,940
management system is all hooked up to

1004
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,560
basically an Access database that is

1005
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,530
running default credentials that's

1006
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,210
sitting on the Internet's so we went

1007
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,680
random we wore drove all the cows and we

1008
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,450
figured out where the access management

1009
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,430
debase was then we actually accessed the

1010
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,960
access management database and changed

1011
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,779
the GPS coordinates of where all the

1012
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,640
cows went so the poor farmers sitting

1013
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,500
there going like the bloody hell forsake

1014
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,830
damnation of my cows in the middle of

1015
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,210
Colorado no longer in Wyoming I got a

1016
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,440
good friend that lives in Colorado I

1017
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,080
ended up putting about two and a half

1018
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:59,300
million head of cows in his house it's

1019
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,710
not a happy bunny so ah it isn't going

1020
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,230
to end well why isn't it going to end

1021
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:07,880
well because we can go after the crops

1022
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:09,200
as well you talk about computers we

1023
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,720
always think about computers in the

1024
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,029
traditional sense corporate building

1025
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,759
computer can break into it we tend not

1026
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,220
to think about computers in

1027
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,350
non-traditional systems inside farms

1028
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,990
inside factories inside all these kind

1029
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,960
of facilities inside the tractors that

1030
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:30,310
plant the crops here's a scenario for

1031
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,050
you in a particular company that

1032
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:37,610
produces tractors that is partly gold

1033
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:39,650
and partly green there's two FTP servers

1034
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,620
SMTP servers that are sitting those two

1035
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:45,890
SFTP servers do updates for the entire

1036
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:48,290
globe's worth of tractors they're not

1037
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,359
the most secured updates either what you

1038
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,580
can do is you can hook up to their SFTP

1039
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:55,340
server take a look at what's known as

1040
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,660
the PTC so basically you've got your

1041
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,280
nice shiny tracker and when you want to

1042
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,500
go plant crops you plug in this damn

1043
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,590
device at the back which slows the crops

1044
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,000
in the ground everybody with me so far

1045
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,520
which is marvellous until you go hey I

1046
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,280
can adjust how deep or how shallow the

1047
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,259
crops are sown so instead of your barley

1048
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,240
or your wheat being sown four inches

1049
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,690
deep I stow it two inches deep or an

1050
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,689
inch deep or six inches deep so now I

1051
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:23,270
affect your crops not only do I affect

1052
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,790
your crops I affect the futures market

1053
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:27,410
which now means rather than hacking Wall

1054
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,950
Street I can screw with Wall Street

1055
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:34,339
that's more fun thing to do they're

1056
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:37,279
already good so far good let's talk

1057
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,260
about hacking humans so there are three

1058
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,280
ways to hack it that's probably more but

1059
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,620
let's just look there's three ways to

1060
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:48,430
hack a human psychology

1061
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,380
social engineering or let's just hack

1062
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,240
the bloody human so we're gonna throw

1063
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,020
the crystal ball out a little bit but

1064
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,479
not too far out we're gonna talk about

1065
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:02,100
nanotechnology the idea of either using

1066
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,590
carbon based basically molecules as

1067
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,549
micro machines or biochemical technology

1068
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,710
in other words the whole idea of using

1069
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:10,330
the body is itself we're gonna talk a

1070
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,910
little bit about nanotubes and nanotubes

1071
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:15,759
and so what the hell is in nano thing

1072
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:18,460
it's that bloody small ridiculously

1073
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,320
amazing there's a human hair there

1074
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,920
stereo Silla and there's a carbon nano

1075
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:26,890
farm rather small little critters but

1076
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,110
extremely versatile because all you're

1077
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:32,259
doing you're manipulating atoms it's

1078
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:37,390
atomic level stuff so where were we see

1079
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:40,630
where we were this is 1997 so 20 years

1080
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:43,930
ago carbon nanotubes and carbon nano

1081
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:46,830
technologies built a playing what do you

1082
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:49,779
call it guitar isn't it a guitar no no

1083
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:53,259
where are we today well this is where we

1084
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:55,300
are today we're able to educate the

1085
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,860
atoms not only can we make pretty

1086
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,210
patterns out of them we actually have

1087
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:03,460
the ability to get them to recognize

1088
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,350
what where and how they are in the body

1089
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,720
as well as some of the chemical elements

1090
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:10,029
that they're interfacing with what does

1091
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,029
this mean in English means a simple

1092
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:16,780
thing it means I can go backwards to

1093
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:19,060
early days of coding to go forwards to

1094
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,530
communicate with the damn things so

1095
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,750
those of you that are looking at biology

1096
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,220
those of you looking at the sciences

1097
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,200
this is really where the fun starts

1098
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,390
where we actually crossing over really

1099
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,790
extensively you take some very very

1100
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,379
simple coding languages you give it the

1101
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:35,920
ability to withstand the constraint

1102
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,990
Falls in you replay it on a frequency

1103
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,750
and now you can basically inject you

1104
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,759
take physical to a frequency wave

1105
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,490
frequency wave either transmitted over

1106
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,530
laser or UHF or near for communication

1107
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:50,319
and now I can actually communicate with

1108
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,730
the molecules themselves as long as

1109
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,850
they've got the receptors and antennas

1110
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,980
nozzles of other fun things so I've got

1111
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,210
carbon nanotubes I've got my Cody beyond

1112
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,790
my programming and I can

1113
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,220
the two to talk to each other well

1114
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,220
that's great but what the hell uses a

1115
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:09,069
carbon nanotube well if you attach a

1116
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:11,859
tail to the carbon nanotube and you

1117
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:14,980
apply frequency to it you can make the

1118
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:19,150
damn thing move so now I've got swimming

1119
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:20,560
carbon nanotubes this is where we are so

1120
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,330
now I can actually get this carbon

1121
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,710
nanotube to go directions and other

1122
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,520
functions there was a something that

1123
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:32,200
came up on gosh I thought it was on line

1124
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,359
last week there was a specific program

1125
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,220
look it up online basically somebody

1126
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,410
decided to mess around with spurns and

1127
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,660
eggs so rather than the strongest sperm

1128
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,310
gun woohoo I got this one covered what

1129
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,230
they ended up doing they manipulated

1130
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,480
some of these buggers so the exact one

1131
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,800
that they wanted got to where it needed

1132
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,990
to be as quick as possible

1133
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,849
so no longer is that the strongest will

1134
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,459
survive it's whichever one actually won

1135
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:55,930
out against this critter survives

1136
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,570
there's a youtube video about it which

1137
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:01,330
scares the living crap out of me not

1138
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,680
only that but we can actually get them

1139
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:05,259
to a stage where they can make

1140
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:08,020
independent decisions based off of

1141
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,150
recognizing different chemicals so the

1142
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,040
whole concept here is if I drop carbon

1143
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,320
architecture into your body and I make

1144
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,180
it intelligent enough it can go around

1145
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,089
the body and start to understand what is

1146
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,379
in the body the upside of this is

1147
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,960
fantastic

1148
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,730
the downside of it is the six foot three

1149
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,310
hairy things going hey you guess what I

1150
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:32,410
can do to this well we can hack it

1151
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:36,580
obviously cos that's what we do let's

1152
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:39,520
dip into science for a second if we take

1153
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:42,819
a look at this one we take a look at how

1154
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,770
an attack strategy would work how do we

1155
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,230
attack computer systems we know today

1156
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,119
and then how do we apply that to the

1157
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,330
biological level of the world it's

1158
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,820
simple we have a receptor keys are

1159
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:57,190
transport basically bird flu think about

1160
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,619
a vaccine whole concept of a vaccine is

1161
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,390
take something that's nasty kick it a

1162
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:02,800
few times and then inject it back in

1163
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,410
again because in theory shouldn't kill

1164
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,060
you we have the bypass tools we have a

1165
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,368
reporting tools in our payload and we

1166
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,570
have our decoys everything that we would

1167
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:13,660
use in a red

1168
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:18,070
kela computer environment to break in we

1169
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:21,310
now miniaturize we take out and then in

1170
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:25,270
English here's what we've done we

1171
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,770
basically took bird flu we attach carbon

1172
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,030
nanotubes to it how do we do that we

1173
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,370
obviously have the ability for them to

1174
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,590
recognize the chemicals so now they've

1175
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,000
done that we fooled the body into

1176
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,890
thinking it was good because we've

1177
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,930
injected it as far as part of a vaccine

1178
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,790
we've got the propulsion system that was

1179
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,440
the nice swimmy damn things we obviously

1180
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,490
got the tracking methodology because we

1181
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,320
obviously need to know where the Smurf

1182
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:47,589
it is in the body do you codes mean the

1183
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,080
drug if we're nice we can drop it right

1184
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,930
next to a cancer cell and outside myself

1185
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,430
something really really good if somebody

1186
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,870
like me sitting there going hey guess

1187
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,270
what I can do with an antenna and an

1188
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:03,450
airfield communicator I can now drop it

1189
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:08,350
right onto a red blood cell not so nice

1190
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:11,379
so this doesn't require a very expensive

1191
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:14,880
Labs worth of equipment you can do with

1192
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,880
about a hundred dollars worth of Arduino

1193
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,350
so just the same as the whole press has

1194
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,060
gotten hold of pacemakers and the

1195
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:24,190
ability now to kill you remotely if you

1196
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,210
have a pacemaker and we all know that we

1197
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,890
can kill you if you're running an

1198
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,750
insulin pump and all that shenanigans

1199
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,370
now with the crazy crap that we're

1200
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,300
putting out with nanotechnology you can

1201
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,319
do the same thing with about a hundred

1202
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,940
dollars worth of what do we know so

1203
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,310
those of you like no I don't do any

1204
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:39,870
hardware hacking this is why you want to

1205
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:42,190
do hardware hacking because it's fun

1206
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:47,620
well lots of kills people as well but

1207
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:50,530
that's not so fun so for those of you

1208
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,910
that have an anti-gmo moment there's

1209
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,770
more of that coming down the line

1210
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,060
because not only we decided our this

1211
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,100
stuff's really really amazing to

1212
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,860
actually pump into bodies but now we can

1213
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,140
pump it into the food and we can make

1214
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,120
food last longer and we can make it we

1215
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,629
can put steroids in the food and we can

1216
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,160
drop more of into the agriculture yeah

1217
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,930
I'm not looking forward to this I will

1218
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,149
get back to growing my own food soon and

1219
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,940
if you want supplement swing throw even

1220
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:18,580
more that crap out you coming down like

1221
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,970
so where are we at with this one we're

1222
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,970
about here

1223
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:26,690
you guys remember this movie No

1224
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,089
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs for

1225
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:32,140
crying out loud kid God's people alright

1226
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:34,150
so where are we well we're about here

1227
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:39,500
again

1228
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:41,060
alright panic time and then this one I

1229
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,980
know I'm running low on time on it

1230
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,599
so let's basically go through something

1231
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,720
very quickly this is one of the areas

1232
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,480
that basically as a researcher as an

1233
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,569
attacker whatever you want to call us we

1234
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,480
have done an amazing job as a society of

1235
00:50:53,570 --> 00:51:00,050
putting more and more of us out there on

1236
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,060
the internet we do a phenomenally awful

1237
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,740
job of protecting any of that data and

1238
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,259
we keep putting more and more crap about

1239
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:09,500
us out there so consequences and actions

1240
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,890
what does this mean it means that a nice

1241
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,020
little platform that I have that I run

1242
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:19,640
brings in about a billion targets on a

1243
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:21,800
monthly basis IRC channels i2p channels

1244
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,390
darknet channels the whole lot I bring

1245
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,190
in about quarter of a million credit

1246
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:29,150
cards every single month that people

1247
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,069
lose patient's health care records you

1248
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,680
get the idea

1249
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:36,230
do a better job of looking after your

1250
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,859
data place and the organizations and the

1251
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,819
charges that you are responsible for

1252
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:42,619
we've seen that one before I just

1253
00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:44,390
realized if any of you are interested in

1254
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:46,460
nuclear stuff there's some fun stuff I

1255
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,868
put this one up I was at a government

1256
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,040
meeting and I put this one I put the

1257
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,020
government meeting and like half the

1258
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,880
people went like this cuz they're like

1259
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,849
oh my god we can't CTS level data I'm

1260
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,589
like you lost your so if anybody

1261
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:59,780
wants the pounds for a nuclear plant

1262
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:01,339
Williams stations nuclear reactor is

1263
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,530
actually sitting in an Iranian server

1264
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,000
along with all the tools and by the way

1265
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,250
anybody in the Iranian army actually

1266
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,880
there's all their people as well so this

1267
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,530
is the kind of fun stuff that gets lost

1268
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,210
and then we go back to the vendors and

1269
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,910
the suppliers and this is where it gets

1270
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,819
nasty because I'm not the nicest of

1271
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,140
people sometimes so when we are looking

1272
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:23,240
to break into somebody we will

1273
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,118
occasionally look for the weakest link

1274
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:28,848
and unfortunately more often than not

1275
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,700
the weakest link is the vendor the

1276
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:33,860
supplier the people you might have your

1277
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,480
own environment nicely secured but if

1278
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,030
occasionally you have to hand that data

1279
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,370
to third parties this next slide is

1280
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,440
gonna see why you really have to ask

1281
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,450
them all the nasty awkward questions

1282
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:49,570
because this is what happens when the

1283
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:53,089
vendor fails this was a security

1284
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:55,730
contractor this guy ran security for the

1285
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:57,740
company not only did he do that he had

1286
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:00,170
all of his data and third parties data

1287
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,729
on his portable server and he had that

1288
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,440
and that and obviously at his bloody

1289
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,810
girlfriend if we could have found

1290
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,010
pictures of naked him we would have put

1291
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:10,060
them up there and we were to put a very

1292
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:12,370
very small little thing over it then

1293
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,680
unfortunately we couldn't but quit

1294
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:21,410
mixing business and pleasure on the same

1295
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:25,250
system so wrap up this is going to be

1296
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:26,120
your future some of the stuff I'm

1297
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,800
working on at the moment is

1298
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,290
consciousness and computers where are we

1299
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,570
going to be in 10 15 years time can we

1300
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,340
in are we at a stage or coming towards a

1301
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:37,160
stage where we can upload consciousness

1302
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:40,970
to computers and if we can what the hell

1303
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,009
happens then barriers all sorts of other

1304
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,240
things come down how do we do this how

1305
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:48,950
do we talk all these other wonderful

1306
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,180
things yet the problem is in that 15 20

1307
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,100
years time are we still gonna be

1308
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:56,629
figuring out how the hell to deal with

1309
00:53:52,100 --> 00:54:00,799
passwords you're coming into this

1310
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:02,600
industry how can you change things what

1311
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,470
can you do differently how can you do

1312
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,060
better than we did hopefully get out of

1313
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,290
the red team and blue team men's healthy

1314
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,259
when somebody comes in and goes hey I

1315
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,740
want you to run in the red team go hey

1316
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:17,150
get lost

1317
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:17,839
I want to collaborate with the teams and

1318
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,910
by the way

1319
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,080
tasered the damn vendors every now and

1320
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:25,580
again they need it it's kind of like a

1321
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:27,170
wake up and a reminder for them Tech's

1322
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,360
coming we aren't stopping it

1323
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,740
we tried stopping it with BYOD and a

1324
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,020
whole bunch of other things get used to

1325
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:37,180
it we're going to have to do a better

1326
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:38,390
job we as teams have to collaborate and

1327
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,640
blue

1328
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,830
quite honestly blues kind of got to win

1329
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,759
on this one because if blue doesn't win

1330
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,759
we've got some problems

1331
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:54,710
so we're thanks and then the final slide

1332
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:59,690
from mr. Douglas Adams so long of thanks

1333
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:01,580
for all the fish questions everybody

1334
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:04,640
sitting there gun Holy Smoke I'm not

1335
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,290
gonna ride a train eat food or anywhere

1336
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,080
near the damn doctors for the next six

1337
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:13,730
months what questions you guys got we

1338
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:16,700
use a mate so when you see organizations

1339
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,930
that have really done their security as

1340
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,500
well as can be expected

1341
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:23,600
yes oh okay yeah is there any favorite

1342
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,890
spot that typically desist so tends to

1343
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,170
be more influential is it operations is

1344
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,759
it reporting at CEO is in their CIO or

1345
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,020
does it not really matter just varies

1346
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,700
from organization I think it varies from

1347
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,680
organization to organization I think

1348
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,799
what I see better than anything else

1349
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:43,490
is when the CSO is working closely with

1350
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:46,900
like compliance and legal and regulatory

1351
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:48,979
and HR I think that's when when you see

1352
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,870
because the biggest challenge that we

1353
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,560
have in security and IT as a whole

1354
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:56,150
IT shouldn't own anything arguably when

1355
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,710
you come to me as the business to go

1356
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:59,510
ahead of this really cool database well

1357
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:02,210
congratulations I'll give you a home for

1358
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,670
it but you own the darn thing it's your

1359
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:06,890
data you have to tell me who should and

1360
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,960
shouldn't have access to it so when IT

1361
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,240
goes I want the entire domain that's

1362
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,510
when we fall over on ourselves and then

1363
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,560
Security's got to come in and go hey I

1364
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,270
really want to lock everything down but

1365
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,590
I know users need to use it so I've got

1366
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,150
to work with the business I've got to

1367
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:23,330
work with the IT guys I need to work

1368
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:26,690
with legal and compliance and HR and we

1369
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:28,190
all need to figure out how to solve this

1370
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:38,060
better that's a huge if it comes down to

1371
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:40,790
communication I got a go away Conte's

1372
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,650
them coming in here oh there is all

1373
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,200
right I'm sorry so that we did a really

1374
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:48,310
good talk a DEFCON they're a little kick

1375
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,430
my for a bit I did a really good talk at

1376
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,470
DEFCON

1377
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,910
I got challenged by somebody and winded

1378
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,620
up putting a talk on together as awesome

1379
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,480
was all about communication and it was

1380
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,200
communicating at the user level manager

1381
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,460
level and cxo level

1382
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,348
and that was huge because I think the

1383
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,750
biggest thing that we have and the

1384
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:06,480
biggest success stories is when security

1385
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,680
can articulate what we need to do and

1386
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,810
how we need to and then we provide the

1387
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,069
metrics going in there and going I can

1388
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:14,220
solve your problems if I bought a

1389
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:16,320
firewall that doesn't work it's helping

1390
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,029
to educate those around us how do we do

1391
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,700
this how do we effectively tell the sea

1392
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,560
levels this is how we should be doing

1393
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,549
this at the level they understand and

1394
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,680
then helping to collaborate with

1395
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:27,180
everybody else so yeah there's no one

1396
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,348
good formula I think the biggest formula

1397
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,029
is somebody coming to go and how do we

1398
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:32,160
all figure this out we all draw the same

1399
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:36,750
paycheck we all need to be in this

1400
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:39,500
together to help stop there and thank

1401
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:45,530
you very much no thank you

1402
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,530
[Applause]

1403
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,859
you
