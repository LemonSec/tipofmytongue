1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,480
I'd like to introduce our next speaker

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,919
for the afternoon and joining us from

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,830
the Air Force Research Lab AFRL is

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,390
Lockean and Locke has been doing a lot

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,419
of work with the DARPA cypher grain

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,640
challenge experience so he's going to

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,160
spend some time talking to us about his

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,050
experiences with the DARPA Grand Cyber

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,849
challenge so I'll turn it over to you

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,490
all right

11
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,150
everyone can hear me right perfect thank

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,070
you very much

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,860
so I just want to thank serious for

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,450
inviting me here share my story with the

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,269
cyber grand challenge with you nice

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:46,180
folks now I just want to start this

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,230
story always has a beginning right let's

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,719
imagine this it's 2014 I just graduated

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,779
with my PhD in 2013 so it's a little

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,270
year prior right and as the general

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,940
would say you can imagine me I'm in a

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,940
pink tutu with a one with little fairy

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,980
wings flying around I got ideas up the

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,920
wazoo right because this is what we do

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,100
in our PhD studies you do some problems

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,800
and then you identify honey's of tons of

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,210
ideas and that's what we do so that was

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,729
me and so 2014 a year after I graduated

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,429
the program manager of the cyber Grand

30
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,010
Challenge came over and he said this he

31
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,750
said you know we have this cool program

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,100
it's called a cyber Grand Challenge

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,710
we're going to have these automated

34
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,729
machines kind of compete against each

35
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,020
other they're going to find

36
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,760
vulnerabilities they're going to patch

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,490
them all of Italy's this is going to be

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,890
the future this is going to be something

39
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,080
that you can take part of wow this is

40
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,060
pretty cool right this idea fairy I'm

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,590
getting my fairy dust ready all right so

42
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:54,040
this is cool now then he said well you

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,720
know the final event we're not really

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,610
worried too much about because

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,020
everything's going to be air-gap there's

46
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,640
going to be all these kind of automated

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,750
machines we call them cyber breeding

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,770
systems they're going to be competing

49
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,690
against each other

50
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,090
everything's going to be good but then

51
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,829
there's this qualification event like

52
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,509
this qualification event we're kind of

53
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,810
worried about we're kind of worried

54
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,279
about the integrity of the competition

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,930
when we have this qualification event

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,890
and so this is the problem

57
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,599
depos for those of you don't know the

58
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,420
cyber Grand Challenge qualification

59
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,238
event took place in June of 2015 and

60
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,569
this is a notional kind of depiction of

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,040
what it is you have us part of the

62
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,540
infrastructure team where the referees

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,099
were in the middle we build

64
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,608
infrastructure that's what we do we

65
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,439
design everything okay and what we do is

66
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,810
we send out these little boxes we call

67
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,540
the challenge sets these challenge sets

68
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,060
a binary x86 binaries that run on decree

69
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,840
operating system with all the special

70
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,819
every single one of them has a

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,579
vulnerability in it every single one of

72
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,939
them it's up to these little machine

73
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:59,950
guys who are distributed all across the

74
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,870
world anybody can participate as long as

75
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,959
you have a US presence right so you can

76
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,989
get their cash if you want and you're

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,400
supposed to find them patch them or find

78
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,409
a little bility improve that you're

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,459
found a vulnerability okay so in a

80
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:18,129
nutshell the problem is this we give

81
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,169
them a challenge set they take it munch

82
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,179
on it a little bit and then they find

83
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,430
either patch D vulnerability that exists

84
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,109
find you're going to daily improve that

85
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,389
you can find it by crashing this

86
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:33,010
particular challenge set very simple

87
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:36,010
setup okay but remember these guys or

88
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,078
these machines could be gals I guess I

89
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,040
don't know they're disputed all over the

90
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:44,500
place we have no idea what is in there

91
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,689
so the real problem that he's worried

92
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,979
about in terms of competition integrity

93
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:52,328
is is this a machine or is it some poor

94
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,549
graduate student sitting behind a

95
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,579
computer monitor right hacking away

96
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,250
finding vulnerabilities attaching them

97
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:03,280
this is the problem so once again this

98
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,889
is very very interesting right this is

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,419
me with my degree a my kind of training

100
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,180
and program analysis so in other words

101
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,919
my training was building disco right and

102
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,409
now I have to kind of worry about wait a

103
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,690
minute you know yeah I never really

104
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:20,108
thought about that problem right so huh

105
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,608
as any good academic will tell you right

106
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,380
when you get a problem you got a model

107
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,270
it you got to kind of distill it down to

108
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,550
the basics so this is kind of what we've

109
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,169
distilled down to I have two observables

110
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,760
I have one it's the palette the patch

111
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,930
challenge set the other one

112
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,060
- proof of vulnerability that they

113
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,580
submit these are the only things that

114
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,830
they submit now remember they don't have

115
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,780
to submit it to you but if they do these

116
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,719
are the only pieces of information that

117
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,580
I can actually process now it's it's a

118
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,550
big giant black box and I need to

119
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,010
determine is it a person or is it a

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,730
machine right once again very very

121
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,349
interesting so of course any good you

122
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,700
know kind of researcher once again is we

123
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,520
thought wow you know what are the cool

124
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,080
ideas that I have let me think of it hmm

125
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,390
maybe how I can formulate this problem

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,810
maybe I can think about things that

127
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,090
people can do or machines can do right

128
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,270
if we can have a separation ah there we

129
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,419
go

130
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,000
right that is what I want that's pretty

131
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,740
cool okay right but then of course that

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,630
you do research because that's one of

133
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,210
the things we're supposed to do you find

134
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,219
ah it's already been done right and in

135
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,140
the academic circles if it's already

136
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,740
been done even remotely we don't do it

137
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,000
it's not novel right so of course me I'd

138
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,040
say now I don't want to do this anymore

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,120
right now of course you want to do

140
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,850
something like this so this is pretty

141
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,400
cool okay so this is kind of a notional

142
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,920
idea if you want of what we want to do

143
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,320
in terms of this problem set is there

144
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,280
the same kind of idea of a CAPTCHA

145
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,380
except for challenge done for a program

146
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,119
with vulnerability which is a CAPTCHA

147
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,090
right so we can differentiate between

148
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,680
the humans and the machines so once

149
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,869
again this is getting really really

150
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,820
interesting right and I'm kind of

151
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,830
getting ready you a this is no the fairy

152
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,180
part of me with these great ideas are

153
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,789
popping up Wow

154
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,890
okay and then of course reality hits ads

155
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,510
with anything in terms of research we

156
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,510
get these kind of things which is oh

157
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,240
well it's been done and of course as you

158
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,250
saw earlier today right there's an app

159
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,930
for that effectively if you have

160
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,760
captures there are people who provide

161
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,130
services to go and defeat the captures

162
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,840
so if I want to put a capture and want

163
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,940
to be challenged that well it's already

164
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,520
known to be defeated that's not very

165
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:38,110
good right I can't really detect things

166
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,990
so wait a minute you know if I think

167
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,230
back I got a degree in this thing right

168
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,970
I got a PhD I know what the field is I

169
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,920
what the limitations of machines are in

170
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,720
terms of analyzing programs right

171
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,090
there's this limitation for indirection

172
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,960
if I want to blow up the state space

173
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,289
what do I do

174
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,750
I add in a indirect jump or I add in an

175
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,640
indirect wrench so only at runtime will

176
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,740
you actually know where it goes right so

177
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,780
this is something that we know yeah this

178
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,760
is good right I'm getting excited I'm

179
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,340
getting confident here another one

180
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,159
complex instructions how many different

181
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,770
tools have I actually worked on have I

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,200
seen out in the literature that actually

183
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,560
supports reasoning on let's say

184
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,140
floating-point instructions there we go

185
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,690
right how many of them support SSE

186
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,419
instructions maybe very little so these

187
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,940
complex instructions ah see there's

188
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,410
another one this is getting better right

189
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,900
and then we can think about things like

190
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,490
loops and recursion so if you think

191
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,989
about what it's the current state of ER

192
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,730
most of the tools that are out there

193
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,420
what they do is they say I have a loop

194
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,210
I'm going to unroll it 20 times if I

195
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,160
can't really decide anything now that is

196
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,049
just I'm just going to give up okay or

197
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,840
they try to find some loop invariants

198
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,100
and things like that but ah this is

199
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,900
something else that I might be able to

200
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,410
take advantage of right so these are

201
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,560
hard problems for machines another one

202
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,570
protocols we know if you look at the

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,950
protocol reverse engineering right a lot

204
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,420
of the publication's a lot of the work

205
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,979
what they do is they tried their very

206
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,620
hardest and their best to identify

207
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,450
keywords right you've identified the

208
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,400
keywords you can use that as part of the

209
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,320
protocol analysis then you can use paint

210
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,060
analysis and whatever else to you know

211
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,340
kind of follow through maybe you want to

212
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,070
do symbolically who knows okay but

213
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,099
there's a limitation here what if we

214
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,409
have a challenge response if you know it

215
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,060
exists you can actually write program

216
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,530
for that if you don't know exist now you

217
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,479
got a reason well is there a challenge

218
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,640
response what's challenge response

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,890
involves things are known to be hard

220
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,590
like a cryptographic hash function it's

221
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,890
a one-way function right no way you can

222
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,020
reverse it so what that means now is yes

223
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,580
there are papers out there that says if

224
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,050
I have an input I'm going to go and find

225
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,220
a different blocks out of put encryption

226
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,490
because I'm going trying to figure that

227
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,650
out right but it's still really it's

228
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,030
known to be a hard problem so now we're

229
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,819
set

230
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,230
a so now I'm feeling good ah I got the

231
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,300
solution these are the things that we're

232
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:09,940
going to do all right but not really and

233
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,609
here's the problem in all these great

234
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,080
ideas oh I'm sorry yes I forgot about

235
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,340
this one there's this thing you know

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,080
this is for the IBM Wragge right this is

237
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,880
something that people can do all right

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,710
Watson can do this to a lot of other

239
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,420
people maybe not okay I made a lot of

240
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,680
other machines maybe not right and

241
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,479
especially we don't celebrate

242
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,650
Thanksgiving who knows is the turkey

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,290
right when the world is a turducken

244
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,260
right who would think up of something

245
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,719
you just shove them I don't know okay so

246
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,939
anyways right this is also at this other

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,450
problem but what I was trying to say is

248
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,530
there's this problem here right

249
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,230
fundamentally these are problems on a

250
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,949
hard for machines but unfortunately they

251
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,570
can also be hard for people okay so in

252
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,570
other words that separation that we

253
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,430
liked things that are hard for people I

254
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,310
mean doing things that people can do

255
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,130
things that machines can do it's not

256
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:06,280
really that clean right we happen to be

257
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,740
in a space where I have learned right

258
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,839
through my education all the things that

259
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,180
machines can't really do and people

260
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,100
can't really do very well either

261
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,020
okay so what do you think right Oh

262
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,820
before I ask you the question of what do

263
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,819
you think would you take on this project

264
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,450
I also want to point out that the

265
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,690
program manager says they have an RFP oh

266
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,330
right

267
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,550
so they have an RFP that says you smart

268
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,740
people out there if you want to take on

269
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,079
this challenge of ensuring the integrity

270
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,870
of the competition we're going to give

271
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,890
you money all right we didn't have any

272
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,320
takers so I'm going to have to go and

273
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,810
deal with the world's best hackers right

274
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,000
who are indie competitor teams the

275
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,030
world's best mind then we want to take

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,220
on this challenge and I have just gone

277
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,250
through all the things that I knew that

278
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,860
I was pretty confident about right do

279
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,370
you think I want to do this all right of

280
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,960
course no way you got to be crazy if you

281
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,700
want to do this right so if I was that

282
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,950
fairy I really quickly just ripped off

283
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,430
my wing to just rule away right so did

284
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,570
is a very very nice lesson everything

285
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,239
that I've learned in terms of that

286
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,579
Kadima and all these kind of great ideas

287
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,269
yeah bring get back down to earth right

288
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:28,029
so this is really really important

289
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,500
although of course you might not know

290
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,649
the program manager but a program

291
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,139
manager for the cyber Grand Challenge is

292
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:38,380
quite persuasive okay and what he told

293
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,880
me was this he said you're not the only

294
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,699
one doing this we have a great team

295
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,380
right this is the team effort right

296
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:46,329
you're doing one part they're going to

297
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,699
have other methods other techniques but

298
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:52,149
to kind of detect these things so do

299
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,620
your best and you know everything's

300
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,899
going to be fine right so it takes

301
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,910
someone with that kind of knowledge that

302
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,220
kind of comfort and that kind of

303
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,449
foresight to say everything's going to

304
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,820
be fine just do it

305
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,130
all right so finally of course I succumb

306
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,500
to this persuasion and I said okay fine

307
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,389
all right I'm going to go and do this so

308
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,279
now it's my job to make sure that we

309
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,500
have a way of finding out whether or not

310
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,890
one of these cyber reasoning systems is

311
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,920
a person or is it really a machine okay

312
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,660
so oh yeah this is kind of reality here

313
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,589
right in reality most likely were

314
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,910
probably going to be somewhere in the

315
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,199
middle right because people don't really

316
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,329
just look these one himself they write

317
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,930
the tools okay so this is my little

318
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:36,760
segue to kind of think about things a

319
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,609
little bit differently you know so I've

320
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,199
spent you know many years a few years

321
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,209
trying to look at program analysis

322
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,380
techniques malware how programs have

323
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,790
written what are the tools and

324
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,100
techniques that we can actually use to

325
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,529
go and analyze them automatically manual

326
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,860
or whatever it might be and then because

327
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,899
I took on this project I started going

328
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,760
down a rabbit hole of reading psychology

329
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,519
papers right and this is fascinating

330
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,930
because cognitive biases are one of the

331
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,940
most fascinating things that you can

332
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,459
actually look into right they're the

333
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,250
things that we subconsciously just kind

334
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,969
of click and so like I don't know if

335
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,699
this will work

336
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,980
we'll see right this is a computer

337
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,880
security kind of environment if I say

338
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:23,260
buffer many of you might think overflow

339
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,510
right hopefully yeah but what if I had a

340
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,730
program that gave you a choice

341
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,110
I said fill in the blanks and happened

342
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,860
to be buffer and then you come up with

343
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,019
overflow

344
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,120
what's the two different answers right

345
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,480
the second answer is over weed same

346
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,670
number of letters okay and I can even

347
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,380
give you buffering and over but you know

348
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,939
this kind of cognitive bias what are we

349
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,500
familiar with these are the kind of

350
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,519
things that we can might be able to

351
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
target right

352
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,060
ah you're familiar with that right and

353
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,560
then we also went down this kind of

354
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,599
other rabbit hole of looking at things

355
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,459
like Benford's law so Benford's law is

356
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,709
one of these things that says if I go

357
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,268
and ask you to go and kind of select you

358
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,760
know numbers random numbers

359
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,560
okay the way that you select them is

360
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,660
actually not a normal kind of a

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,040
distribution right it's not uniform okay

362
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,490
so we started looking at things like

363
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,019
that

364
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,820
and we know that like the banking

365
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,930
industry uses Benford's law to detect

366
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,970
fraud and things like that I mean ah

367
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,540
maybe you can use that as well so this

368
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,430
is really cool right this kind of weird

369
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,769
really hard problem has now led me to

370
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,380
look and expand beyond what I normally

371
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,449
do so this is pretty cool so what did

372
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,720
that go here's an example of something

373
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:34,120
that we actually did do based on this

374
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,120
idea of different statistics right how

375
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,639
one person might select values different

376
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,800
from what a computer might do this is a

377
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,389
problem this is called the dolphin teen

378
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,099
third-order dolphin teaming up their

379
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:50,110
powers without finding equation

380
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,790
basically you have ABC is equal to you

381
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,949
know D and everything is cubed over

382
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,180
there and give some of it and it's up to

383
00:14:53,949 --> 00:15:00,699
you as a user or as the solving for this

384
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,290
challenge set okay so the vulnerability

385
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,810
is hidden behind this problem it's a

386
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,300
little riddle basically all right fine

387
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,518
ABC and D okay so if I was the person

388
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,969
what do I do

389
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,760
anybody would get yes right and so if

390
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,550
you google it you're going to get to

391
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,380
vote from alpha I mean sorry I mean math

392
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,420
world okay for more fun and you're going

393
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,740
to get this nice little table and it's

394
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,449
going to give you a list of all the

395
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,040
solutions right well I mean at least the

396
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,939
first like 20 or some hot solution I

397
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,010
gave you the first top four okay now I

398
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,290
don't know how many of you have noticed

399
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:39,310
that in the previous slide there is this

400
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:44,469
magical thing called you in 32 right

401
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:46,900
in you and 32 we have overflow right so

402
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,600
we have overflow so if I take the same

403
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,470
kind of problem set and I encode it into

404
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,100
a query for a solver like z3 I get this

405
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,529
crazy answer up there now we notice

406
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,140
there's a huge difference between what a

407
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,790
machine if you use a solvent XD 3 would

408
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,069
come up with because of this overflow

409
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,099
problem and the answers that we actually

410
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,580
get immediately from Google right so

411
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,100
here is something that's concrete ok so

412
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,140
just to give you a sense if I add

413
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,970
additional constraint I'm finally be

414
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,740
able to get to a particular solution

415
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,040
that I might actually want right but

416
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,380
this requires an additional insight to

417
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,500
add these additional constraints so now

418
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,529
based on this idea what we can do is I

419
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,220
can now architect and build a challenge

420
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,810
set which involves hiding a

421
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,450
vulnerability behind one of these kind

422
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,609
of problems and then we're good right so

423
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,740
this is pretty cool but from an academic

424
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,240
sense this is not very rewarding at all

425
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,820
right you're not going to write a paper

426
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,100
a lot of this this is what in the

427
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:56,620
euphemism in academia circles is this is

428
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,240
engineering right but hey I mean to me

429
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,490
this is one of kind of like the cool

430
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,920
lessons this is engineering but man this

431
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,890
is kind of fun and exciting right so now

432
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,869
let's just look at this other problem

433
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,550
here is there are only a certain number

434
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,099
of these things I can come up with

435
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,869
syan I mean come on so one thing that we

436
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:17,379
do notice another kind of interesting

437
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,178
thing is there's this kind of weird I

438
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,850
mean it's kind of obvious if you think

439
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,160
about it right differentiation between a

440
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:28,000
human and machine I can replicate the

441
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,800
machine as much as I want ok and in the

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,720
space of vulnerability enough in terms

443
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,810
of solving these things right it is as

444
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,500
we recall you know we can parallelize it

445
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:40,540
as much as you want okay so I can't

446
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,250
replicate people well maybe not yet I

447
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,139
don't know maybe someone who had figure

448
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,860
out what I'm doing that but I can't so

449
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:51,100
what this means is that fundamentally

450
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,709
machines are scalable humans are not ok

451
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,889
so the second

452
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,370
part of what we actually did takes a

453
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,860
look at this particular problem right

454
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,969
once again academics let's try to

455
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:09,360
distill down what is the nature of a

456
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,880
vulnerability see if we can use that so

457
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,600
for example everybody's favorite up

458
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,330
overflow

459
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,980
okay in a buffer overflow what we have

460
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,168
is we have a source which you define as

461
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,289
a buffer or bike everybody knows this

462
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:24,240
right and then we have this kind of bad

463
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,090
programming as people would say right

464
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,309
you did it for t you have a count that

465
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,990
you're passing in for the receive which

466
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,760
means give me this many but number of

467
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,919
bytes okay so I'm going to represent

468
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,510
that as this kind of read thing if my

469
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,590
input is a it goes in the buffer

470
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,840
everybody's happy

471
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:45,000
great ok now I have an observation the

472
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,049
observation is that if the count is

473
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,760
greater than one of the size of the

474
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:50,039
buffer is I have a buffalo this is a

475
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,820
very standard definition everybody knows

476
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,860
this right and then I also know that in

477
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,960
terms of the quantification event my

478
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:02,340
point to prove a vulnerability is to

479
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:05,010
crash the binary so I can put that as in

480
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,720
addition observation right I prove a

481
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,210
vulnerability if I call the sex phone

482
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,309
now the question is how do I call the

483
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,049
sexual I call the sect fault is the

484
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,889
return address for example is going to

485
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:18,330
be an invalid value and the function has

486
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,130
to return right so these are two

487
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,129
constraints as you can see what we're

488
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,490
doing here is we're building upon the

489
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,260
nature of what this vulnerability is in

490
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,779
terms of what are all the individual

491
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,059
constraints okay so from here you would

492
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:37,370
say AHA I can do that I can overflow it

493
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:39,570
and basically we have the constraints of

494
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,340
the counter squares in the buffer plus

495
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,779
there has an offset right because of

496
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,039
where the return address is I have to be

497
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,929
able to make the return address you'd be

498
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,750
an invalid value and then finally the

499
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:52,620
function returns this is the nature of a

500
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,980
buffer overflow okay what this means is

501
00:19:52,620 --> 00:20:00,090
if I take a vulnerable program with a

502
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,399
buffer overflow I encode this these are

503
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,480
my few variables and I can now generate

504
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:08,428
as many different vulnerabilities or

505
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
programs all right with different

506
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,530
vulnerabilities the same exact

507
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,418
vulnerability but different

508
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,580
characteristics as much as I want right

509
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,290
and so the idea here is that if you're a

510
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,980
machine and you can solve one of them

511
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:21,330
you can solve any it for a person if you

512
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,160
can solve one of them you can solve any

513
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,199
of them but it's going to take you a

514
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,770
while to disassemble to look at things

515
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,780
right

516
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,150
so in other words there is a disparity

517
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,360
between how fast machines can do it and

518
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:36,840
how fast the humans can do it so what

519
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,909
this really became is this became a oh

520
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,699
yeah so there you can do padding but

521
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,179
what this became is this became a source

522
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,660
to source generator right where we take

523
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,880
a binary I mean a channel set which has

524
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,320
the source code for we take that we

525
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
distill what the nature of the

526
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,250
vulnerability is we write a template for

527
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,400
that and if we generate as many as you

528
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,799
want right and so now the problem is if

529
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,600
you are a machine here have fun with it

530
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,330
and you should be able to solve all them

531
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,620
people yeah you can do it too but it

532
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,840
just take you slower okay so I also want

533
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,280
to point out that you can do the same

534
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,320
thing with other things like protocol

535
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,720
like format strings right I don't have

536
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,450
to do a percent f as a C string and with

537
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,309
this I can do a dollar sign s I can do a

538
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,660
lot of different for my character as

539
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,309
compared with different kind of strings

540
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,350
there are a lot of things that we can do

541
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,178
but the nature of the vulnerability the

542
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,719
difficulty in terms of reach ability of

543
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,790
it is exactly the same okay so this is

544
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,370
kind of what we had in terms of the

545
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,080
insight here and it really kind of

546
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,570
evolved from this idea of what can

547
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,760
people do versus what the machines do to

548
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,830
this kind of final realization once

549
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,750
again it's just engineering right that

550
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,879
people can do what machines can do it

551
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,530
but there's different speed okay

552
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,679
different things they can do and if

553
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,570
you're interested you can go online to

554
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,790
the github page for the type of Grand

555
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,350
Challenge right you can go on download

556
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,970
the source you can find all the bugs

557
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,389
that are in there because I know there

558
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,020
are bugs

559
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:09,390
I voted ok that's pretty obvious right

560
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,139
I'm knowledge developer you can go and

561
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,330
play around with it

562
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:17,100
right and just have a little bit of fun

563
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,629
and it's I just wanted to you know kind

564
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,129
of leave this which is just this

565
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,750
reminder that

566
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,020
this this is kind of like a crazy

567
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,750
problem that was given to me right and

568
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,780
normally you have to be crazy to take it

569
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,020
on but you know once again I got tricked

570
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,110
I took it on and it's you learn a lot

571
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,500
and the most important thing is there's

572
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,050
a lot of unknowns in terms of this space

573
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,360
but someone has to do it right and the

574
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:49,200
other thing in terms of important lesson

575
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,870
here is it's not just engineering you

576
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,450
really get a deep appreciation of what

577
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,020
it actually means to have to have

578
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:01,140
something work right I mean I could have

579
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,760
probably spent another kind of three

580
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,610
four or five years doing other

581
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,780
dissertation on this particular problem

582
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:11,899
right but I didn't because I can't

583
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:15,090
this idea of engineering being just of

584
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,770
nothing right having be solid deadlines

585
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,899
so you have to get something working

586
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,420
right and actually transitioning and

587
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,970
make and deploy it this is a very

588
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,100
important lesson and I would actually

589
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,930
challenge you in terms of the people in

590
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,699
industry to go into academia see what

591
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,650
they do right for people not to be able

592
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,020
to go into industry and do engineering

593
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,610
work not the standard kind of let's go

594
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,590
into industry and do some kind of

595
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,280
research and whatever else right for

596
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:44,189
your sabbaticals you know this idea of

597
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,840
getting a exposure and experience from

598
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,150
all these different kind of walks of

599
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,300
life it's kind of what I have to do here

600
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:54,540
and that is very very rewarding okay so

601
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,240
in a nutshell that is pretty much you

602
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,770
know what I did right there are more

603
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,540
details of course if you want to know

604
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,600
but now it's not the time to talk about

605
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:09,770
it if you want you know we can always

606
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,770
chat offline okay so yep

607
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:32,929
okay if there are questions please come

608
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:36,050
to the mic and ask if you have a

609
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,610
question okay if not thank you very much

610
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,919
that was informative I appreciate in

611
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:46,498
time

612
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:46,499
[Applause]

613
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,500
you
