1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:13,910
all right as Jerry says this is a little

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:16,279
bit of a feature that we run every year

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,590
for several years we have our three

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,948
distinguished speakers who you heard

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,310
from too already are our third Ron Ross

6
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,960
will be giving the closing keynote and

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,180
I'll give more of an introduction to him

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,400
then but he's a fellow at NIST security

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,140
expert of great renown

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,289
he's been inducted in the cyber security

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,829
Hall of Fame and undoubtedly if you've

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:45,680
read any NIST 800 documents recently he

13
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:50,390
has the credit none of the blame for

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,690
producing the hose yeah so the idea here

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,059
is a fireside chat is I'm going to at

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,980
least kick off with a few questions get

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:01,309
their responses for you as the audience

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,640
and then as time permits with a hard

19
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,380
stop at three o'clock we are going to

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,390
invite questions from the audience that

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,530
they can also respond to to give their

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,820
unique perspectives so the one that I've

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,729
got a couple that I want to start with

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,389
in and one is in the area of the growth

25
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,679
of the field internationally and issues

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,540
of trust so we have for a long time sort

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,250
of viewed the internet and much of the

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,850
development of computing from a

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:36,680
us-centric perspective but it is clearly

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,320
an international business huge commerce

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,960
that crosses borders communication

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,419
entertainment a lot of information

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,839
passage that goes across borders with

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,869
knowledge growth and sharing and we are

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,399
seeing a greater concern over trust in

36
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:57,049
the communication and the the equipment

37
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,420
and the protocols that are being used

38
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:04,670
across borders with greater apparent

39
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:08,240
greater involvement by various

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,800
nation-states and lack of prosecution of

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,810
actors within some of the borders

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,450
because they appear to be carrying out

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,520
some nation-state objectives

44
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,130
what do you think is going to be the

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,780
future of our ability to trust this

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,450
computing infrastructure internationally

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,400
or where should we be trending to be

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,140
able to have the confidence to you to

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,480
base our international level of trust

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,179
I'll start I'll throw myself a grenade

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,010
you know frankly I think we're at an

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,900
inflection point where the future is

53
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,440
really really cloudy on this one right

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,120
now my Jedi skills are not very good and

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,760
looking at the future of this because

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,030
frankly as we take a look at elements of

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:55,100
privacy access to markets just access to

58
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:58,760
information the fact that many countries

59
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,250
do not view law the same way we do and

60
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,440
give refuge to folks that I would

61
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,260
consider its miscreants you know

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,800
internet miscreants really are providing

63
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,679
a lot of stress points I do believe that

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,019
diplomacy is going to be one of the main

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,120
items that we need to invest in in

66
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:22,750
regards to this this issue however there

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,760
are still many folks out there who view

68
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,150
internet access as a sovereignty issue

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,480
just as they would spectrum access or

70
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,780
access to airspace or maritime or for

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,880
ground access and I don't think that we

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,350
have consensus throughout the United

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,500
States on how to attack this issue staff

74
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,880
but I think that diplomacy is the way

75
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,220
that we're going to have to address this

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,829
as our first and foremost Avenue of

77
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,790
approach so so you don't before having

78
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,739
the others answer so you don't

79
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,390
necessarily buy into a senator

80
00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:01,549
Sensenbrenner it's a statement that the

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:04,458
internet is voluntary okay yeah I think

82
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,010
it right now it is so ingrained in our

83
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,890
society here it's not so much in others

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,220
but it's catching up elsewhere and and

85
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,519
I've only been in 40 countries around

86
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:19,339
the world and I can tell you that as we

87
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,918
take a look at our national economy our

88
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:25,010
well-being access to marketplaces and

89
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,320
the like it's critically important that

90
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,469
we have Internet

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,020
access so that we can in fact make sure

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,970
that somebody in any country around the

93
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,310
world can order from Amazon or any other

94
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,130
great American purveyor of goods and

95
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,910
services but even more importantly the

96
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,250
Internet is an equalization mechanism

97
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,670
for folks to have information so that

98
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,890
they can be free and make decisions it's

99
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,840
a cultural phenomena as much as it is

100
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,640
national security or national and I

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,119
think soon to order from Weibo and

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,940
Flipkart

103
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,490
as well here at the u.s. absolutely so

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,230
so gentleman I I won't try and predict

105
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,060
the future around this either I'll just

106
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,070
give two data points that I think are

107
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,580
relevant to this discussion you know one

108
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,760
on the attack side when our government

109
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,950
went to China and made specific points

110
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,280
around the attack that they were making

111
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,190
against US interests the level of

112
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,140
attacks went down and you can see that

113
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,610
in the threat intelligence and the

114
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,280
activity that was going on so that

115
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,290
there's clearly a diplomatic part of

116
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,729
this that can affect level of a tax

117
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,920
level of threat that we face from

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,290
adversaries the second piece is there

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,960
are countries in the UK in particular is

120
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,470
one that is taking action at the

121
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,340
Internet network level to protect their

122
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,650
nation from everything from routing

123
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,359
attacks against traffic that might be

124
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,179
rerouted out of their country into other

125
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,670
countries as well as attacks against

126
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,310
their email even things in both email

127
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,620
spoofing from addresses that should be

128
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,450
coming from within the UK so countries

129
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,640
can protect themselves and it may be

130
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,950
easier for smaller countries in the u.s.

131
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,979
to do that but there are proactive

132
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,719
things that can happen

133
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,110
well staff this is a very difficult

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,720
problem I I think the future of our

135
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,480
security really is right out here in

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,840
front of us and this audience today you

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,630
know we I grew up in the kinetic age I'm

138
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,340
a child of the 60s I was born in 1951 I

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,830
just went on Social Security this month

140
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,150
as a matter of fact and I'm still here

141
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,760
still fighting the fight because it's

142
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,370
important and one of the things that's

143
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,440
different if you go back to the early

144
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,630
60s we we built something called the

145
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,070
nuclear triad

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,469
was the bombers the missiles and the

147
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,469
submarines the most expensive investment

148
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,180
this country ever made the likelihood

149
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,850
that we would ever use that nuclear

150
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,340
capability was extremely small but we

151
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,620
still made the investment why because

152
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,349
when you look at risk we talk about

153
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,070
classic risk assessments and threat

154
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,770
vulnerability impact and likelihood the

155
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,260
most important thing we looked at in the

156
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,719
1960s is are the asset that we are

157
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,000
protecting was the United States of

158
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,210
America the our freedom our way of life

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,030
and so we were willing to make that huge

160
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,560
investment knowing very well that the

161
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,979
likelihood we'd overused that capability

162
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,300
was very very very small and the reason

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,580
we did it because the consequences of

164
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,490
not making that investment we've been

165
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,930
catastrophic so you fast forward to you

166
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,720
know today 2017 we have built an

167
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,150
incredibly powerful IT infrastructure

168
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,890
the innovation is unprecedented from

169
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,950
smartphones to tablets to all the

170
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,370
computing power bandwidth unfortunately

171
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,760
we abandoned about 20 years ago our

172
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,040
commitment in making that trustworthy

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,310
and it's not about policy policy plays a

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,810
role in everything we do but you've got

175
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,470
to get down to what I call the blocking

176
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,080
and tackling

177
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,050
that's what's path started doing 30

178
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,599
years ago it's the foundation of trusted

179
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,540
computing and so about four or five

180
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,270
years ago we went back and looked at the

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,340
40 years of trust technology concepts

182
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,250
and principles that we've developed

183
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,590
going way back to the Anderson report of

184
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,320
1976 and we brought forward all of those

185
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,869
in a niche publication on security

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,430
engineering that Greg helped us announce

187
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,430
that at the Splunk conference back in

188
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,520
Washington in November from the metal

189
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,760
it's exactly what you all do here at

190
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,340
Purdue and in serious you study the fund

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
I called the blocking and tackling this

192
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,039
is a computer science and engineering

193
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,020
issue if we were having bridges fail and

194
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,520
airplanes drop out of the sky at the

195
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,829
rate we experienced successful

196
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,720
cyberattacks the first folks we call in

197
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,040
would be the scientists and the

198
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,600
engineers say what the heck's going on

199
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,000
here

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,160
but we don't do that we kind of put IT

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,470
and securing its own little stovepipe

202
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,140
and we have to have a national

203
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,960
discussion soon because we are pushing

204
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,890
computers to the edge they're going into

205
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,520
weapons systems power plants everything

206
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,220
medical devices pacemakers in your chest

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,000
automobiles and we have zero margin for

208
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,560
error now because the integrity and the

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,810
confidentiality and the availability of

210
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,790
those computers and that software is

211
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,670
critical to the survival of the country

212
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,560
that's why if you're in this program you

213
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,949
are getting the fundamentals from the

214
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,250
master and that's an investment that you

215
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,230
will never regret and we have a

216
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,500
tremendous shortage of security

217
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,840
professionals but that's a wide swath of

218
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,480
skills a lot of folks today claim

219
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,220
they're security experts and they can't

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,980
tell you what makes a good programming

221
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,900
language or you know how to how to build

222
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,640
a compiler or some of the things that

223
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,949
get - I call that below the waterline

224
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,350
discussion I'll talk about that in the

225
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,660
last hour but we have to make this

226
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,770
investment and soon because if you don't

227
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,020
take care of business below the

228
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,300
waterline the hardware the software the

229
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,550
systems and focus on the trustworthiness

230
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,920
there everything above the waterline

231
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,209
continuous monitoring configuring your

232
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,280
firewall all that stuff makes no

233
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,870
difference and so that's where what we

234
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,640
have to do we have to just fundamentally

235
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,190
change course and it's going to take

236
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,290
everybody well you actually touched on

237
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,200
two things one is kind of an

238
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,640
illustration of what I was saying when

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,700
you gave the example of building up the

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,840
nuclear infrastructure huge amounts were

241
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,480
also spent by point since the French

242
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,370
allegedly the Israelis the Soviet Union

243
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,890
invested a huge amount in espionage and

244
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,260
development and found a shortcut to

245
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,439
doing that North Korea right now is

246
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,560
posing a considerable set of questions

247
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,260
by their pursuit of that same technology

248
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,619
so simply investing in the technology is

249
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,850
not necessarily a guarantee we actually

250
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,010
have to go a little bit further in

251
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,740
developing some of the norms perhaps

252
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,380
that that we haven't done as as well in

253
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,290
developing as we might some of the work

254
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,750
that Chris painter

255
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,399
for instance that state has been trying

256
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,810
to do to develop norms of appropriate

257
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,980
use but the second thing you touched on

258
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,199
I think is an interesting one here

259
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,699
particularly for potentially the

260
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:22,170
students and some of the instructors in

261
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,349
the audience and some of the people who

262
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,170
hire here is the changing nature of the

263
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,089
field and it has led to some interesting

264
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:35,219
changes as well on how address security

265
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:37,259
when some of us learned what we were

266
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,990
doing in computing we were able to

267
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,459
actually cover the entire field of

268
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,680
computing and during the time of

269
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,420
undergraduate major there were enough

270
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,370
courses we were able to take compilers

271
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,250
and architecture and operating systems

272
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,420
and automata theory and data base and

273
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,329
that was pretty much everything we

274
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,829
needed to know for the whole field now

275
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:59,910
we have a field that is so large that

276
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,969
faculty of a hundred doesn't even begin

277
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,750
to cover all the areas and our students

278
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,060
are being pushed by potential employers

279
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,370
to get through an undergraduate major

280
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,979
and maybe the closest they ever get to

281
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,440
the machine is learning Python and as

282
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,910
you were saying David during your talk

283
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,649
they don't actually understand anything

284
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,110
about file structure or disk because

285
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,389
everything is an object in the cloud so

286
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:29,120
how do we go about dealing with security

287
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:32,250
when we no longer have people learning

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,810
computing fundamentals and the vast

289
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,610
majority of employers don't pressure

290
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,810
institutions to teach the fundamentals

291
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,029
how do we go about well what do we do

292
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,729
about that is there anything we can do

293
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,600
or that you can suggest we should do so

294
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:51,630
any of you so just to tackle this first

295
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,730
I guess I'm feeling old now because

296
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,730
because I got a classical computer

297
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,589
science education at Carnegie Mellon and

298
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,449
I feel like understanding how the

299
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,589
systems actually work is actually really

300
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:07,319
important and but that is very different

301
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,110
from getting a job writing software

302
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,660
today my brother who went to Tufts and

303
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,240
got a political science degree couldn't

304
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,100
get a job took a six-week programming

305
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,050
class and now he's a consultant writing

306
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,209
software and has been for the last 15

307
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,769
years that's the level of expertise you

308
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,719
need to learn how to write Python code

309
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,819
maybe not to be the best place on code

310
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,120
developer in the world but when it comes

311
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:31,589
to security you know there is the

312
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,199
administration the writing of code that

313
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,779
is fairly simple to actually understand

314
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,420
the risk that we face down to the

315
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,769
fundamental levels of security down to

316
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,930
as you were talking about you know

317
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,180
trusted computing down to the hardware

318
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,309
levels and how those things may interact

319
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,899
with each other it does require a pretty

320
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,630
comprehensive understanding and there is

321
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,160
a very very small pool of people who

322
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,470
actually understand security at that

323
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,170
deep level I mean we have about 500

324
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,209
people at tripwire the number of really

325
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,389
core security experts that drive our

326
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:05,880
company forward is you know probably you

327
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:07,350
know less than a dozen and that's

328
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,660
typically what you would see at any

329
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,819
large security company these days people

330
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,370
who really understand it really know how

331
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:17,510
to move the state-of-the-art forward is

332
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,790
not primarily what the industry is about

333
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,069
so that might take you know from my

334
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,000
perch sorry Ron that's how you lean in

335
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:29,219
then okay you know I'm a I'm a geek I'll

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,160
admit it I if you go in to take a look

337
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,589
at minute 56 of Star Trek Wrath of Khan

338
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
Kirk says clearly you know it's

339
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,339
important to know how things work and

340
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,889
why and unfortunately we've been

341
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,839
focusing too much on the a player and

342
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:48,660
the OSI model as opposed to the whole

343
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:51,899
stack our adversaries are not for the

344
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,100
last 15 20 years of my professional

345
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,010
career we've been duking it out with

346
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,040
some really nasty people on the internet

347
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,559
and the really good ones are not the

348
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,199
ones who you know cut their teeth with

349
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,649
visual basic and just stopped and you

350
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:11,399
know moved on from there the folks that

351
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:14,339
we are up against who are leveraging

352
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,920
their skills against our country and

353
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,709
against our friends and against our way

354
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,899
of life they're investing the time to

355
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:25,559
understand how things work and why they

356
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:28,350
are understanding and mastering all

357
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,439
layers of the stack they are

358
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,200
understanding how the physics

359
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,600
works down at the chip level you know

360
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,970
the really good ones are out there in

361
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,520
volatile memory because they know how

362
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,220
things work it's important for all of us

363
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,160
to recognize that we do have to invest

364
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,350
to understand how things work because

365
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,930
others are are making those investments

366
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,090
and I think in many cases and I

367
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,130
certainly saw this in the military when

368
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,740
we were doing military training we used

369
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:03,390
to go all the way down to the basic

370
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,580
physics and it just it many people went

371
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,160
to cut it because it was too expensive

372
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,020
it meant the educational process took

373
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,020
longer which meant more expense and

374
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,760
alike I think it's important to get back

375
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,470
to basics in many places it is important

376
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,060
and I thought about this problem a lot I

377
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,500
think this is what I think just keeping

378
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,079
me up at night about trying to figure

379
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,900
out how we get out of this partly

380
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,100
technological Jam and partly policy and

381
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:34,590
just it's a societal issue about who

382
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,570
what we invest in and what we value and

383
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,090
you know your point staff about

384
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,130
companies and we have great companies

385
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,370
great great innovators we innovate that

386
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,280
to anybody but yet making that

387
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,190
investment I think it's going to take a

388
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,959
national level focus maybe from the

389
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,130
white house on down I can't think of how

390
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,500
you do this without actively engaging

391
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,200
government industry and academia and the

392
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,480
only thing I can think of in my lifetime

393
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,910
well before many of your lifetimes was

394
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,730
the the great space race when President

395
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,339
Kennedy said back in 1961 very famous

396
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,470
speech we were in a hot missile race

397
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,020
with the old Soviet Union we were behind

398
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,939
and he made a speech of the country and

399
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,329
said we're going to go to the moon and

400
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,400
do other things before the end of this

401
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,869
decade not because they are easy but

402
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,150
because they are hard

403
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:29,520
very very famous speech it was

404
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,640
motivational and what he did at that

405
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,530
point in time he activated the best of

406
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
what we do in this country we bring

407
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,790
together the best and the brightest in

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,250
government industry and academia and we

409
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,889
were able to put a man on the moon in

410
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,240
less than eight years we've been trying

411
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,770
to do two factor authentication

412
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,010
the federal government for 10 years and

413
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:52,320
still can't do it right so that that

414
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,129
just goes to show you how far we've come

415
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,270
and this kind of downhill slide and I

416
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,309
think that's going to take something

417
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,010
like that to engage industry because

418
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,320
industry we had this discussion 20 years

419
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,300
ago with the old orange book and trusted

420
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,370
product evaluation program many of you

421
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,840
might have been around during those

422
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,899
times when we had this vision of

423
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,870
building trusted operating systems we

424
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,460
actually built one example of a trusted

425
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,750
OS and every one of the classes in the

426
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,179
orange book from the lowest level of

427
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,860
assurance up to the a1 level which is

428
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,300
the highest level of assurance we

429
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,969
actually had worked examples from

430
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,220
industry what we didn't do is go back

431
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,050
then and force the government people to

432
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,020
buy those trusted products so what

433
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,000
happens in industry well the military

434
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,700
commanders were calling me asking for

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,230
waivers hey this operating system has

436
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,820
been evaluated but there's another

437
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,130
generation that was just produced by the

438
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,500
same company we want the newest version

439
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,210
so you know you don't say no to a three

440
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,000
or four stars in general or an admiral

441
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:55,140
those wavers ended up crushing that

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,580
program more than once and you say once

443
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:03,540
but that's usually how you ask exactly

444
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,189
but the point is we planted the seed but

445
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,690
we didn't follow up we do that a lot in

446
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,429
the government we start these wonderful

447
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,020
initiatives and then we abandon it we

448
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,360
don't we don't have the ability to put

449
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,320
our nose to the grindstone and see it

450
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,059
through and that decision in 1996 the

451
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,740
government abandoned its trusted product

452
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,210
program for the most part we still do

453
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,050
now I panned some of the things under

454
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,050
Common Criteria

455
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,340
but it's not a concerted effort and I

456
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,830
asked a Navy captain

457
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,860
in 1996 I said serve this is back when I

458
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,270
was just out of the military what do you

459
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,219
do if commercial industry doesn't

460
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,389
produce the level of trustworthiness in

461
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,360
those products that we're going to be

462
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:42,240
using and he never had an answer because

463
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,050
there is no answer so you know we've got

464
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,760
to be able to motivate this I call this

465
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,550
the essential partnership government

466
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,410
industry and academia with a big

467
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:55,889
challenge a national challenge that goes

468
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,360
to the heart of our future of economic

469
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,900
and our national security because if you

470
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
look at what's been going on last five

471
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,280
so they've basically emptied the

472
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,979
national treasure from the f-35 design

473
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,620
documentation to everything in OPM I'm

474
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,670
not sure I know some of you might have

475
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,129
security clearances out there all of my

476
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,080
top-secret clearance information is now

477
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,370
safely in the hands of somebody else and

478
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,139
maybe it's safer there than it is with

479
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,610
our well our butts down you don't have

480
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,920
to fill out everything for a visa now

481
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:25,449
exactly they're just they see whatever

482
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,490
you have yes the hash tag sad yeah but

483
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,400
the sad part of this whole story is that

484
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,040
we know how to solve this problem we

485
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
know how to do better and we just have

486
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,550
to get the right people in leadership

487
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,380
positions everything in our business

488
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,139
really becomes down to leadership

489
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,060
governance and accountability if you've

490
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,790
got those three things everything else

491
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,379
is easy we can solve the blocking and

492
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,570
tackling we have the best scientists and

493
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,460
engineers on the planet and they know

494
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,250
how to build trust technology thanks to

495
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,610
a lot of the work that staff started

496
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,260
three decades ago keep reminding me of

497
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,969
that and yeah let's okay I think it's in

498
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,860
a good way yeah you talk about getting

499
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:07,750
Social Security and then three decades

500
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,100
and oh my god well actually I have a

501
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,960
couple comments two years and then I

502
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,649
have follow-up question for all of you

503
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,420
but the first comment is this actually

504
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,700
is perhaps an international challenge

505
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,380
and if we think of it in those terms if

506
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,270
we only produce something that's trusted

507
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,520
within the US we're going to close off

508
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,470
markets to a lot of other places so

509
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,710
that's an interesting additional

510
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,890
challenge is to build components that

511
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,950
can be with moderate or ma or no effort

512
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,900
trusted by by others across different

513
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,730
boundaries that's a little bit different

514
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,670
way of thinking about the problem then

515
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,470
maybe perhaps some of us have up to now

516
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:48,610
the second one is you mentioned the

517
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,590
extra put man on the moon I think many

518
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,600
of you out here with a little bit of web

519
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,209
search can easily find where they're

520
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,250
claiming that that with all the hoaxes

521
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:00,790
in fact anything that occurred in the

522
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,280
news was a hoax it was it was fake news

523
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,950
according to some people and that makes

524
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,660
it very difficult as well to to try to

525
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,610
establish some norms and and otherwise

526
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,750
so I have as a follow

527
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:19,479
up to this a driver that has appeared in

528
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:24,400
some markets for security in in recent

529
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:27,190
memory is privacy and there are some who

530
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,500
claim privacy is dead and and others who

531
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,630
say it's just changing but I see that as

532
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,679
a driver let me also say if any do you

533
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,730
have some questions you'd like to pose

534
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,290
to the panel just come up to the

535
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,730
microphone and I'll after they've

536
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,530
answered this round of questions I'll

537
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,440
pick on you or I'll come up with another

538
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,200
one so anything that you want to say to

539
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,030
the privacy issue

540
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,100
well I'll jump in on that because I have

541
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,320
a great deal of passion on this you know

542
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,350
frankly as we were taking a look at

543
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,850
trying to define strategy the cyber

544
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,559
security strategy one of the first

545
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,199
things I did as the federal chief

546
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,809
information security officer is I

547
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,919
decided to find the mission you know

548
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,690
everybody wants to know where you're

549
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,040
going and what it's going to look like

550
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,990
and the mission statement was very short

551
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,490
our mission if we did our job right as

552
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,679
cybersecurity professionals in the

553
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,230
federal government was to support an

554
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,419
open and transparent government that

555
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,980
protects the people's information and I

556
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,040
always capitalize the people because

557
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,690
that's the way it is in the preamble

558
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,710
while preserving privacy civil rights

559
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:33,580
and civil liberties I think that we have

560
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,620
got a dramatic need here within the

561
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,500
United States to have a very open and

562
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,239
public conversation about privacy civil

563
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,500
rights and civil liberties when it comes

564
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,590
to our information Europe has some very

565
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,190
significant legislation that's going to

566
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:53,230
take full effect next year I know that

567
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,390
my friends in the financial services

568
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,669
sector for example are all over the

569
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,429
privacy issue because of where Europe is

570
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,440
going but frankly here in the United

571
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:04,570
States I don't see this as having the

572
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,010
same level of fervor and attention and

573
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:11,740
I've got children who are in their 20s

574
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,440
they don't really have the same interest

575
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:20,400
in privacy as people of my generation my

576
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:24,220
generation you know your privacy is now

577
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,680
undergoing some changes when it comes to

578
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,280
big data and a lid

579
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,930
and then every time you go and freely

580
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,730
give some information you just need to

581
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,030
think of where's this information going

582
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,440
to go and I don't think a lot of folks

583
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,270
are doing that anymore I don't think

584
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,640
people are giving it the same level of

585
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,629
attention or thought that they used to

586
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,790
and once you freely give up your privacy

587
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,980
and you surrender your information

588
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,590
getting that genie back in the bottle is

589
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,090
increasingly difficult so I think we

590
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,919
need to have that public conversation

591
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,570
here in the United States I think that

592
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,950
the architecture that David laid out

593
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,080
this morning and we're talking about

594
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,470
people building for the cloud and having

595
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,960
the store outside the numbers that I've

596
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,850
seen from companies and you know you

597
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,309
have a perhaps better better hold on

598
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,320
this than I do is that for many

599
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,960
organizations that collect data it right

600
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,370
now it's cheaper to add more storage

601
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,050
than it is to spend the time and effort

602
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,090
to go through and clean out the old and

603
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,800
incorrect data and so they just keep

604
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,809
adding to whatever they've got they keep

605
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,240
storing it wherever it is and as a

606
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:29,730
result they do the big data analytics

607
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,679
with potentially incorrect information

608
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,600
so does that kind of match up with what

609
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,880
what you're seeing in the marketplace as

610
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,490
well yeah absolutely and I think the

611
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,080
bigger issue for consumers and I talk to

612
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,179
a lot of large organizations that are

613
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,100
holding a lot of consumer data is

614
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,260
consumers have fatigue of their

615
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,969
information being stolen now I mean it's

616
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,550
how many times can you steal my name

617
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,100
birthday social security number before

618
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:56,340
it's close to public information maybe

619
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,750
not fully public but any adversary you

620
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,220
know probably has gotten it multiple

621
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,960
times and now they have to do their own

622
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,929
correlation of all the different ways

623
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,670
that they got my personal information

624
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,920
and so I think people have lost an

625
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,240
expectation of privacy because of all of

626
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,460
this data theft that's gone on in

627
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,010
certain areas especially around things

628
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,260
that retailers would have I think people

629
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,570
haven't quite realized where that's

630
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,360
headed around detailed healthcare

631
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,980
records and health care information you

632
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,990
know I think people still feel like

633
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,400
there's a level of privacy even if there

634
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,440
had been some insurance breaches it

635
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
hasn't been to the point where I can

636
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,760
look up someone's name and find in a

637
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,890
database somewhere every prescription

638
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,820
drug you've ever taken but that's the

639
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,800
information that's kind of the next

640
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,010
frontier of what I would expect we're

641
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,800
going

642
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,810
to have this fatigue around of all of

643
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,030
the personal information that you felt

644
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,950
like really was still private for you

645
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,740
and now what happens when that gets

646
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,970
breached three four five six times and

647
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,940
you realize that's not private anymore

648
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,550
either and so I do think we're in the

649
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,700
cycle organizations care about it

650
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:02,790
because of disclosure laws because of

651
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,040
regulation because of compliance because

652
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,020
of the cost of losing the data the cost

653
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,840
of a data breach is significant enough

654
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,700
and has been driven up by things like

655
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,620
disclosure requirements that

656
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,480
organizations pay attention to that and

657
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,949
try and protect the data so there are

658
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,390
things that from a government policy

659
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:24,030
perspective we can do to create more

660
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,980
cost associated with not protecting that

661
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:29,310
data properly and that will improve

662
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,110
things to an extent as well well privacy

663
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,060
is every bit as important as security

664
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,729
and in fact it's so important listed

665
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,190
about four years ago in our update to

666
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,710
800-53 our control catalog many of you

667
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,890
know that document we actually added an

668
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,690
appendix for privacy controls and we're

669
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,610
getting ready to release after about a

670
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,000
year's worth of work we were supposed to

671
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,979
release on March 28 but the document 853

672
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,050
Rev five was supposed to be out in March

673
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,450
it's in a slight delay now it's at the

674
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,730
White House being reviewed we took all

675
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,110
these privacy controls and we did a full

676
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,390
integration of privacy

677
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,100
throughout the security control catalog

678
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,800
in essence we have a privacy engineering

679
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,750
group at NIST now that works alongside

680
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,030
with our security engineering group and

681
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,520
we recognize there's such a tight

682
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,810
coupling in these two disciplines they

683
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,040
come from different legislative

684
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,200
authorities Privacy Act of 74 FISMA but

685
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,030
yet there's a common overlap if you

686
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,740
think of a Venn diagram there are

687
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,210
certain things on the security side that

688
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,710
the privacy folks don't care about and

689
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,570
vice versa

690
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,280
but there is a common overlap in other

691
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,810
words you can't have good privacy

692
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,180
without having a fundamental

693
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,830
underpinning of good security you have

694
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,140
to have those systems and that has to

695
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,030
start at the system level so we've gone

696
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,890
through and done a full integration it's

697
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,570
unprecedented world that's done this

698
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,400
that I know of in any control catalog

699
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,830
and what it's going to do it's going to

700
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,559
move the privacy folks into the same

701
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,480
team as the

702
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,120
security team and they're going to work

703
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,919
as a unit now and I think one of the big

704
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,559
failings in our security business over

705
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,330
the last probably two or three decades

706
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,379
we've isolated security into its own

707
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,850
space we have things like security

708
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:09,370
station or certification accreditation

709
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,529
we think of security its own stovepipe

710
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,178
and that's why it's been so hard to

711
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:14,919
bring those requirements and those

712
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,600
controls into the boardroom because

713
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,129
they're operating their own little space

714
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,019
we talk to each other all the time we

715
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:21,490
have great rallies and it's like the

716
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,600
football team in the locker room you try

717
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,559
to go out the door's locked

718
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,320
we have to get security integrated into

719
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,559
the lifecycle from day one and that's

720
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,178
what our special pub 800 160 does if you

721
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,110
haven't looked at that but I was go

722
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:40,809
download it it's on the web 800 X 160 it

723
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,090
brings security requirements into the

724
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:44,889
trade space so they become part of every

725
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,350
other type of requirement you negotiate

726
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:48,729
requirements in cost schedule and

727
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,649
performance terms that's what risk

728
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,629
management really is when the war

729
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:54,699
fighters want to build a new weapon they

730
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,748
want everything but then they get into

731
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,139
the cost schedule and performance

732
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:00,279
aspects and you have to do trade-offs

733
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:03,279
until you get to something that's fit

734
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,749
for purpose and actually works if we

735
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,879
don't get security and privacy into that

736
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:08,080
discussion it's never going to happen so

737
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:12,908
that's what we're trying to do it just

738
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:17,049
to push that from from inside out so a

739
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:21,220
comment that the we actually heard in

740
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:24,490
both of your keynotes David and Greg had

741
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,899
to do with people and one of the things

742
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,970
several years ago I heard Dorothy

743
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:30,219
Denning talk about was how at the turn

744
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,210
of the century AT&T was talking about

745
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:37,289
growth of telephones in the country

746
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:41,580
not this century the prior century that

747
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:44,590
we sort of grew up in and with and Bell

748
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,869
Laboratories was saying that by the end

749
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,970
of that century at the growth rate of

750
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:50,379
growth of telephones everybody would

751
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,759
have to be a telephone operator you know

752
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:53,129
you saw they had the plug boards they

753
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:57,249
were sitting there and putting wires in

754
00:30:53,129 --> 00:31:00,189
to keep up with the demand and this was

755
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:01,509
viewed as a crisis and yet that's

756
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,940
actually what happened

757
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:05,440
by the 1960s 1970s every

758
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,970
was a telephone operator they looked up

759
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,009
on a telephone directory they punched in

760
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,620
a telephone number and they were

761
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:14,110
connected with their calls we also saw

762
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,029
another example of this where interfaces

763
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,539
were developed differently the m1

764
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:19,090
Abrahms

765
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:22,149
I had an opportunity to drive one of

766
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,370
those great fun it's been developed it

767
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:28,360
has three controls on the dashboard

768
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,969
that's it start shift and fire

769
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,629
extinguisher everything else is is a

770
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:36,580
steering wheel like on a motorcycle and

771
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:38,759
it's really easy for someone to just

772
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,769
drop in and teach them how to use it

773
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,149
very very simple that addressed the need

774
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,500
that it took too long to get people

775
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:47,289
trained up or they weren't interested in

776
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,580
doing it the number you cited this

777
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:50,169
morning was we're going to have a

778
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,539
shortfall of over a million people and

779
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,450
security by the end of the decade is

780
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:57,039
there a middle ground here between what

781
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,659
ron was talking about about the

782
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,408
fundamentals walking and tackling what

783
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:01,809
you were talking about really

784
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:03,250
understanding a computer and also being

785
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:06,879
able to have an interface that most

786
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:09,970
people can use you don't have to answer

787
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:12,428
that I just it was a long question I've

788
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:15,009
got some thoughts on it well you were

789
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:19,740
thinking about or anything yeah I think

790
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:23,500
we have here is a quality problem and

791
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,659
you know frankly the shortfall in

792
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,429
security is basically a shortfall and

793
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,570
folks trying to fix stuff that's

794
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:33,909
delivered generally in poor quality to

795
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,830
begin with this is kind of a

796
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:40,779
controversial view but if you look at it

797
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:42,490
from a you know dr. Deming you know TQM

798
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,549
the Apple approach or a Malcolm

799
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,720
Baldridge view of it really we got you

800
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,679
can make the case that we've got a

801
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,179
quality issue and if we built in quality

802
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,690
from the beginning we wouldn't

803
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:57,700
necessarily need so many security folks

804
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,220
to try to clean up the mess on aisle six

805
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,870
I think that there's a case to be made

806
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:07,539
to make a bigger investment and building

807
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:11,289
insecurity from the start which is what

808
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:13,600
Ron was saying right and and then from

809
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,929
there we can buy down our risk of not

810
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,119
having enough manpower to clean up after

811
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,679
the fact look you know the best example

812
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,110
I can use is the automobile industry

813
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,419
when I first my first car barely had a

814
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,610
seat belt and then over time they

815
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,080
offered optional airbags and when I was

816
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,639
a young second lieutenant I had to make

817
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,649
a decision if I wanted to have an airbag

818
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,139
or an eight-track and I chose the

819
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:36,928
eight-track because ii attendants are

820
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:39,090
bulletproof but over time the automobile

821
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,399
industry combination of regulation and

822
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,490
free-market innovation we came to what I

823
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:46,619
call the balance point and there's some

824
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,299
automobile manufacturers produce some of

825
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,730
that stuff because they want to make

826
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,139
safer cars on the other hand they start

827
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,769
to be optional and we've moved their way

828
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:58,019
to seatbelt airbags steel reinforced

829
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:59,519
doors and now a bunch of computer driven

830
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,139
safety features that keep you from

831
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,450
changing lanes and falling asleep and

832
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:05,820
eventually the car is going to drive

833
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,830
itself to wherever you want to go the

834
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,078
question is when you buy a car they

835
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,899
don't say here's your airbag go install

836
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,530
it in your garage the balance point to

837
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:19,078
me is industry has a responsibility to

838
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:21,780
build in some of those features and

839
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,909
trustworthiness the assurance related

840
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,319
things that we need and then we still

841
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,000
have a responsibility when you drive a

842
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,558
car you have to go take drivers ed

843
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,059
you're not supposed to drive while

844
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,309
you're drinking and all the things that

845
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,919
are just good from a user point of view

846
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:37,679
in that automobile but you still rely on

847
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:39,779
the manufacturer to bring you a safer

848
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,569
automobile and bridges did we drive over

849
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,210
and airplanes that we fly in why should

850
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:46,440
this be any different it it is yeah you

851
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,030
missed the panel earlier so that

852
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
self-driving car will drive you where

853
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,470
someone wants you to go exactly where

854
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,790
you want to go yeah it just adds about I

855
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,500
mean I think a lot of this complexity

856
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,390
and the skill shortage that people see

857
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,430
is around the idea that there are these

858
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,920
60 different categories of security

859
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,558
controls and security vendors out there

860
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,059
and I do need someone to deploy operate

861
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,369
and manage all of these different things

862
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,440
that are there if you're a small

863
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:12,720
organization you know people are

864
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,210
actively moving to things like managed

865
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,950
services approaches and outsourcing and

866
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,809
people who can get economies of scale

867
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,879
from doing this for you if you're a

868
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:22,920
large organization this is a very

869
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,230
complex problem because the

870
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,089
heterogeneous set of devices

871
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,750
applications and networks you're trying

872
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,490
to protect is very you know it's

873
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,650
very sophisticated it's not a

874
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,720
one-size-fits-all there aren't people

875
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,100
outside of your organization that

876
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,899
generally can even understand your

877
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,430
infrastructure and then you layer that

878
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,280
on when you talk about big companies

879
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,200
they're constantly going through mergers

880
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,150
and acquisitions or adding new parts on

881
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,220
which had a different set of security

882
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,560
products and now my whole challenge is

883
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,270
trying to reconcile what this company

884
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,670
have with this company and how do I get

885
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,620
it consolidated you and to look at a lot

886
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,660
large government organization and you

887
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,400
have those same challenges of trying

888
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,799
you're not trying to secure one thing

889
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,980
you're trying to secure 60 different

890
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,140
large networks which are all not all

891
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,700
that well consistent on how they've been

892
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,040
built up how they're operated and

893
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,470
managed and maybe that can add a little

894
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,330
security by having it not all unified

895
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,339
but it adds a whole lot of complexity

896
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:24,440
standards in the technology which one

897
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:27,620
we'll talk about later and John yes so I

898
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,690
want to kind of throw out a thought

899
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,850
process and see what your reaction is I

900
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,630
work for a company called analog devices

901
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:37,730
were one of the largest providers of

902
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,530
essentially taking the analog world and

903
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:43,970
turning it to a digital or connecting us

904
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:45,650
the physical to the digital right and as

905
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,439
we're in the marketplace at the edge

906
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,840
what we're seeing is that it's more than

907
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,500
security and security I think is a

908
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:58,280
paradigm that is becoming maybe old our

909
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:01,520
customers want data integrity data

910
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:06,590
rights management privacy the ability to

911
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,300
provide to the the folks a value

912
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,720
proposition they're willing to pay for

913
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,000
right what we see happening is security

914
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,859
becoming commoditized in many respects

915
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,320
so we need to drive a different value

916
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,870
proposition I think the other issue is

917
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,070
it's about data and it's becoming more

918
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,060
and more as we're getting connected

919
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:28,340
about developing outcomes by connecting

920
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,810
things and combining things with the

921
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,510
advances that we're making in

922
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,820
measurement and sensor technology that

923
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,850
we haven't had in the past and that's

924
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,850
creating big challenges so we talk about

925
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,118
privacy we're introducing technologies

926
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,400
that you can put on a bicycle

927
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,640
with local low acoustic imaging we could

928
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,519
detect your heartbeat with low radar we

929
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,710
can actually see and predict within two

930
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,019
weeks a high-risk person and heart

931
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,819
attack we can we're putting out a scale

932
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:01,058
that's going to give your act oxygen

933
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:04,210
saturation level pulse with all kinds of

934
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:07,269
stress level so the issue becomes is

935
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,799
that private our fitbit's that were

936
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:10,959
starting to put in place so now the

937
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:13,269
insurance companies the life insurance

938
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,970
companies the talam attic systems in

939
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:18,368
your car our insurance rates our

940
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,980
premiums all of these things are going

941
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:23,829
to be very much tied into stuff that

942
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,170
before we could never imagine was going

943
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:29,140
to be used to determine certain things

944
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:32,349
in our life that we would say is private

945
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,569
to your point and we can't address those

946
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:36,640
with traditional security all right

947
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:39,819
we've got to find ways to secure it at

948
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,660
the edge to somehow provide some sort of

949
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:45,640
privacy in the data itself and bring

950
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,499
that up the stack in such a way that we

951
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,868
can so I think those are some things

952
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:51,999
that are emerging fast and the feature

953
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,619
capabilities that they're trying to

954
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,899
drive from these things are getting them

955
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,099
into the marketplace before a lot of the

956
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,109
issues that we're talking about are

957
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,239
being addressed and nobody's willing to

958
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,519
pay for it so in some respects the

959
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,739
government I think has to start getting

960
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,479
involved in some of these areas to drive

961
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:09,309
industry in the direction to make the

962
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,170
investments and address some of these

963
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:12,759
issues you know yeah there Jonah three

964
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,650
things in that yeah yeah I'm just going

965
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:17,200
to say John that's where really where I

966
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,119
was trying to get to but you articulated

967
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,499
a little bit better than I did from the

968
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,869
standpoint of I think that we need to

969
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:26,499
have that open public conversation as a

970
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:28,480
people as to what are what are those

971
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:30,249
thresholds that we want and where do we

972
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,799
want government to come out and say

973
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:34,149
here's where the lines are and and

974
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:36,579
frankly we don't want to stifle

975
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:40,420
innovation either but at least we need

976
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:42,339
to define what we value and how we want

977
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,440
to protect it and I believe that that

978
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:47,380
should not be done necessarily from a

979
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,289
bureaucratic approach an administrative

980
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,509
approach but rather a very open and

981
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:55,480
public discussion and that should be

982
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:56,980
codified I believe in legislative action

983
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,230
where the

984
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,700
the Congress as the oversight mechanism

985
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,460
directs the executive on how to

986
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,439
implement a certain thing but that's

987
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,850
based upon what the people of the United

988
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,380
States want and I think that's a

989
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,930
conversation we need to have as

990
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,060
Americans and I hear everything you

991
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,490
talked about in terms of security maybe

992
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,830
being less relevant as exists today and

993
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,569
what I heard was just security is even

994
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:22,330
more important than it has ever been and

995
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,190
that you know if you're a yeah if you're

996
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,410
a device manufacturer you're making

997
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,690
embedded systems you have one view of

998
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,450
how you need to secure that piece of it

999
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,250
and a lot of what we talk often talk

1000
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,830
about security is the operational

1001
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,180
security of okay I mean if network

1002
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,520
security or arm security and

1003
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,230
organization but that is only one piece

1004
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,280
of this more complete puzzle you need to

1005
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,380
think about

1006
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,109
I do think large organizations and

1007
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,420
governments have purchasing power and

1008
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:51,580
the ability to push their vendors and

1009
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,580
manufacturers to do things I do think

1010
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,890
consumers have a harder time actually

1011
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,750
being able to push a consumer-oriented

1012
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,339
manufacturer to actually build security

1013
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,890
in and so I do think there's a

1014
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,080
reasonable public argument around at the

1015
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,390
consumer level what should be the

1016
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,920
standards and how should people build

1017
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,290
things for personal privacy

1018
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,170
I think that's harder for a company or

1019
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,970
someone to enforce or force yeah I agree

1020
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,410
with all of that I think that there's

1021
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,149
two points here we talked about this

1022
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,040
balance point between complete

1023
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:23,020
regulation and complete free market

1024
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
innovation there will be a balance point

1025
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,490
it will come out of a national dialogue

1026
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,520
because when you start to produce

1027
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:33,459
consumer items like cameras or DVRs or

1028
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,440
home routers that can be weaponized by

1029
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,830
our adversary so that happened last fall

1030
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,670
with the the Krebs website attack and

1031
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,009
two-thirds of the internet going down

1032
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,680
because those home devices those default

1033
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,240
password wasn't changed those things

1034
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,250
that changes the whole nature of the

1035
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,459
discussion now because now innocent

1036
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,260
consumers have no idea that the products

1037
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,840
they're buying are being turned around

1038
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,520
as weapons against people and

1039
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,480
organization that's the first thing the

1040
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,950
second thing I would say is the

1041
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,630
fundamental to haven't ever changed I

1042
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,879
have this discussion over and over again

1043
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,440
we had it when cloud first came out and

1044
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,270
when mobile came along you will say well

1045
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,980
where are all your new security controls

1046
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,390
for cloud mobile I said look at the

1047
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,850
fundamentals haven't changed

1048
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,160
it's the I ecology it's the physics of

1049
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:18,670
computer security haven't changed for 40

1050
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,910
years how we apply those in small form

1051
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:23,530
factor devices like a smartphone or a

1052
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,710
sensor there'll be some differences but

1053
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,300
after all we are still pushing computers

1054
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,550
those finite state machines to the edge

1055
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,560
and those computers are being driven by

1056
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,080
firmware and software now there may be

1057
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,640
instances and devices where we like on a

1058
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,770
smartphone we had this issue with

1059
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,359
two-factor authentication people didn't

1060
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,370
want to carry around something other

1061
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,740
than the smartphone so we had to develop

1062
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,920
something called drive credentials which

1063
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,330
are placed on the actual device now that

1064
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,490
may seem like a good solution to the

1065
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,860
average consumer out there because they

1066
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:56,259
only carry one thing around but how

1067
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,300
trustworthy is that credential when it's

1068
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,800
it's in an untrusted environment an

1069
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,960
operating system on a smartphone may be

1070
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,120
totally untrusted and that gets back to

1071
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,160
Greg's point about we have to care about

1072
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,920
the entire stack and today I've seen

1073
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,259
those people look from the application

1074
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,910
level up they ignore the middleware the

1075
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,710
operating system the integrated circuits

1076
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,759
all the way down to include the supply

1077
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,010
chain okay

1078
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,650
yeah it's application layer and then pf'

1079
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,090
found the rest of the way we'll do one

1080
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,180
more from the audience and then I'm

1081
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,770
going to wrap up a few minutes Kim

1082
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,470
Christie from Valparaiso University a

1083
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:33,340
faculty member a few minutes ago one of

1084
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:35,740
you said that we what we need is a this

1085
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,370
grand effort where we all call it where

1086
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:42,040
these the the Trinity collaborates that

1087
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:46,180
is government and Industry and academia

1088
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:50,110
on on working together to develop this

1089
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,970
effort at security and secure

1090
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:56,350
environments and trusted computing and

1091
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:57,549
so on and there's been as I see it

1092
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,520
there's been a tremendous amount of

1093
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,980
collaboration between schism between

1094
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,680
industry and academia and that's

1095
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,150
evidence right here with this institute

1096
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,390
and things that are going on in my own

1097
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:17,140
university but then I think about

1098
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:20,440
government and I see the inability of of

1099
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,109
the legislature to pass anything that

1100
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,190
doesn't fall entirely along party lines

1101
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,930
I mean how can

1102
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,119
how is it that we've gotten to a point

1103
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,910
where we're all votes are on party line

1104
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,829
and in that environment there is no

1105
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:35,348
collaboration that goes on there is no

1106
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:39,490
discussion at a national level really

1107
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:41,710
there is whatever the Republicans

1108
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,509
proposes wrong because we're Democrats

1109
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,789
or whatever the Democrats propose is

1110
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,789
wrong because we're Republicans there is

1111
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:51,280
no collaboration and so it's it's that

1112
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:53,859
process the government of the government

1113
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,640
that's broken because people will line

1114
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:01,480
up along party lines and not be able to

1115
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,788
discuss the the real issues so my

1116
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,890
question is is there really any hope for

1117
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:07,780
that grand vision that you had I saw all

1118
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,390
the panelists just not there is hope it

1119
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,430
is there hope there is hope I take all

1120
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,819
your points and anybody out here is

1121
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,259
watch the political scene for the last

1122
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:17,859
couple years understands exactly what

1123
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,990
you're saying

1124
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:21,788
however I'll tell you from from I've

1125
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,529
been the government a long time I had 20

1126
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:25,440
years in the military now 20 and mist in

1127
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,210
between little private sector time

1128
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,029
security has always been a bipartisan

1129
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:32,500
issue ever since I came to NIST and we

1130
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:36,220
briefed the congressional committees on

1131
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,930
both sides now having said that to come

1132
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,700
together on a grand initiative there may

1133
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,069
be some partisan politics that it get it

1134
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,629
gets injected at that point but I'll

1135
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:45,339
tell you the Republicans of Democrats

1136
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,859
have looked at this issue from our

1137
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:49,349
perspective it's pretty neutral

1138
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:52,180
everybody is subject to being hacked

1139
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:54,430
nobody wants to be hacked everybody has

1140
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,339
an interest in making sure our economy

1141
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:59,200
stays strong and in order to do that we

1142
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:01,000
can't be bleeding intellectual property

1143
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,230
with all these cyberattacks do we

1144
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,700
continue to see our federal government

1145
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,180
writ large has had some of the worst

1146
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,700
attacks ever from the Snowden incident

1147
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:15,788
to the OPM incident and it goes on and

1148
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,038
on and on so I am very hopeful that this

1149
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:20,710
particular issue will will have

1150
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:21,970
bipartisan support it may take us a

1151
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,130
while to get there but at some point

1152
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,558
people look around so you know this

1153
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:28,000
affects all of us and we have to come

1154
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,710
together at some point for the good of

1155
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,390
the country and hopefully we'll be able

1156
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,430
to do that but what you say is is very

1157
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,000
true there's a lot of truth to what

1158
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,609
you're saying

1159
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,790
I hope we can change it

1160
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:41,460
gentlemen well I'm pretty passionate I

1161
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:47,520
agree with what Ron said about security

1162
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:50,220
but you know from my perch a couple of

1163
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,280
things first of all let's not give up

1164
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,009
hope we still have the best government

1165
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,270
and construct in the history of mankind

1166
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:03,330
our Constitution is a fabulous document

1167
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,730
and I wish more people read it I pledged

1168
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,770
my life and honor were the uniform for

1169
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:10,830
38 years and if you throw like at that

1170
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:13,410
time I had in there I'd still be wearing

1171
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,569
the uniform and I can still fit in it

1172
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,339
too by the way

1173
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:21,930
well there's a fact-checking here whose

1174
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:24,840
the fact checkers a man come come to

1175
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,190
Arlington on May 5 at 3 o'clock - why

1176
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,020
now I'll fess up I can't fit my

1177
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,070
informant we're burying my uncle I'm

1178
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:36,150
putting the uniform on for him it's up

1179
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:40,500
We the People are responsible it's not

1180
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:43,110
the pinheads that we elect or the the

1181
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,990
bureaucrats that are beaver in a way you

1182
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,480
know in the different offices we the

1183
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:52,529
people are the ones who are bear the

1184
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,750
ultimate responsibility and if we think

1185
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:57,540
that we're in a spiral down it's up to

1186
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,210
we the people to pull back on the stick

1187
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:03,150
and get things right you know if we take

1188
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:07,080
a look at our government it was created

1189
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:09,660
by some some folks who thought ahead and

1190
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,330
there's checks and balances and if you

1191
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,529
think of this as a business and we're

1192
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,740
getting our clock cleaned by the

1193
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,870
competitors what do you do you take a

1194
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,169
look and you reassess where you're going

1195
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:25,049
or our core principles solid darn right

1196
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,910
they are Constitution's great but we got

1197
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,650
some stuff that we've got to sit back

1198
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:32,279
and have that very public and open

1199
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:34,890
conversation we the people are the

1200
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,000
stakeholders we're the shareholders if

1201
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,890
we don't like what the board of

1202
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,500
directors are doing let's go get some

1203
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,779
new board of directors if we don't like

1204
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,290
what the c-suite is doing let's get into

1205
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,210
the c-suite you know ultimately we all

1206
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,569
share that responsibility

1207
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:54,180
and if we don't communicate to the

1208
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:56,369
people that work for us in the

1209
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:59,040
government to set the priorities that

1210
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:01,140
align with what we want then we're not

1211
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,839
doing our job and that's where I think

1212
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,430
that as we talk about where our

1213
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:13,319
priorities are and where we want to be

1214
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:15,660
that we need to as citizens vote in the

1215
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:18,420
legislative process but we also need to

1216
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,720
vote with our wallets and how we invest

1217
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,910
and alike I don't give up hope because I

1218
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,859
think that we you know having been in

1219
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:27,569
those 40 countries there's so many

1220
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:31,078
people who want to be American because

1221
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:32,460
of the Constitution not because of you

1222
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,010
know the commodities that we produce

1223
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:39,960
it's the ideas and the hope that we give

1224
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:43,230
that's my view better thing I think that

1225
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,530
was a good okay exactly so so I'll say

1226
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:49,349
as a scholar of history if you look back

1227
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:52,319
in the US about every 35 years we

1228
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:55,020
undergo certain national traumas they're

1229
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,170
always different but trauma that causes

1230
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,750
us to change and develop a new attitude

1231
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,849
for the way that we embrace government

1232
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,069
and one could argue that we are

1233
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:08,579
undergoing one now or maybe we haven't

1234
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:11,069
quite gotten to it yet I agree that

1235
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,829
there are times where things look bleak

1236
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:17,940
but the population we do have

1237
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:19,619
opportunities to change course we're

1238
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:23,910
almost at the end I've got one last

1239
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:26,280
question for the panel and I'll ask you

1240
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,890
each for a 60 second or less response on

1241
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,569
this the fact that you're all here

1242
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,098
indicates you haven't given up hope

1243
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,599
because otherwise you tell everything

1244
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:39,150
and move to the North Woods and live off

1245
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:41,400
a land but the near term is is certainly

1246
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,650
uncertain what do you sort of see is the

1247
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,760
progression is the next five years going

1248
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:49,650
to get better or worse about the same

1249
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,270
just a sort of a quick view here for

1250
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,339
especially the students who are about to

1251
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:55,049
go out in the workforce Ron why don't we

1252
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:57,930
start with you I think the next five

1253
00:50:55,049 --> 00:51:00,660
years will be a little little downturn

1254
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,180
before things get better but I think the

1255
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,240
the job market

1256
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:07,790
and your career you've chosen a

1257
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,290
fantastic career and I think if you just

1258
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,000
get the fundamentals get you know you

1259
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,520
invest in those fundamentals now those

1260
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,290
will take you a long long way give you

1261
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,540
the confidence to withstand the ups and

1262
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,640
the downs but long term I'm optimistic

1263
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,050
we will get this right whether it comes

1264
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,109
out of the Congress or the White House

1265
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,240
or just the groundswell the Greg just

1266
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,890
talked about the citizens rising up

1267
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,350
being good consumers good citizens

1268
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,600
that's all of our responsibilities and

1269
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,980
you are investing in your future and I

1270
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,390
want to thank every one of you for doing

1271
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,460
that not just the students but the

1272
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,770
faculty as well and all the folks here

1273
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:42,950
from industry it's a great country we

1274
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:44,660
will get this right I asked a similar

1275
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:48,589
question to a group of financial

1276
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,569
services Cisco's and I think 95% of the

1277
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:54,140
room was pessimistic about the next five

1278
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:55,970
years around cybersecurity and I tend to

1279
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,310
listen to our customers because that's

1280
00:51:55,970 --> 00:52:00,529
part of my job and so I similarly am

1281
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,750
fairly pessimistic about the short term

1282
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:04,430
we're going to continue to have breaches

1283
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,790
the complexity of organizations is

1284
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:09,589
continuing to grow and nothing is

1285
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,540
fundamentally changing with the way that

1286
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:13,670
we're operating that's going to reduce

1287
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,800
that at the same time you know you can

1288
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,480
use a lot of different analogies but the

1289
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,730
idea over the long term are we going to

1290
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,360
stop for each is now are we going to

1291
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,850
solve security no but will we get to a

1292
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,330
point where we have a sustainable way of

1293
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:31,790
managing risk for large organizations

1294
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,470
yes and we'll be able to be more

1295
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,420
effective at dealing with that risk

1296
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:37,459
to understand what that risk is and how

1297
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,370
we how we can make the decisions to

1298
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:43,070
invest to be that find that right

1299
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,960
balance for each individual company and

1300
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,420
so I do think it's going to be a

1301
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,070
long-term process of continuous

1302
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,810
improvement that's going to get us to a

1303
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,800
better place I don't think things are

1304
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:58,160
fundamentally changing in the short-term

1305
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:59,990
I'm actually bullish on the next five

1306
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,730
years first I think the Cubs in the Red

1307
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:04,899
Sox here goes both going to win again

1308
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,900
sometime in the next five years

1309
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:12,080
couldn't say that 20 years ago good yet

1310
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:15,260
I think though that we are operating at

1311
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:19,400
a greater risk exposure than the general

1312
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:23,410
population understands at this point I

1313
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,850
really do and I think the next big cyber

1314
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:28,490
incident is going to be centered around

1315
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,790
critical infrastructure and it's going

1316
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:34,250
to make the Ukrainian situation and

1317
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:36,920
Shamoon and Saudi it's those are going

1318
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,450
to pale in comparison and I think that's

1319
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,390
going to be a wake-up event for a lot of

1320
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:45,649
folks and that will fundamentally move

1321
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:51,170
to jeez I think that as we take a look

1322
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:53,590
at the cyber norms that my a good friend

1323
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:56,360
our good friend Chris painter has been

1324
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:57,080
leading on if you haven't taken a look

1325
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,090
at them

1326
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,779
take a look tonight you know get on your

1327
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:05,240
browser type crisp painter and then

1328
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,940
cyber norms and the four norms that we

1329
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,919
have been promoting internationally I

1330
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,680
think they will be accepted formally I

1331
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,320
think it will go through not a bilateral

1332
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,509
process but a multilateral multinational

1333
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,320
process and I think that will set the

1334
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:24,920
stage for a greater international

1335
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:27,230
conversation on cybersecurity risk

1336
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,720
management privacy and some other

1337
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:34,250
matters that I think are intrinsically

1338
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:36,470
linked to the integrity of the world

1339
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:39,110
economy because we are all globally

1340
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:44,109
linked together I think that you're also

1341
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:46,820
going to see greater attention paid to a

1342
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:50,240
supply chain when it comes to both

1343
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:53,360
hardware and software and I know that my

1344
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,390
friends and the manufacturing sector

1345
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:59,440
have been addressing that already with

1346
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:02,120
greater on-site surveillance and

1347
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,000
manufacturing processes but the

1348
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,620
surveillance on the software

1349
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,030
manufacturing process is something that

1350
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:12,880
I think we're going to see some growth

1351
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:16,520
in between the suppliers and the

1352
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:19,210
requirement requiring organizations so I

1353
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:22,210
think that we're going to see a lot of

1354
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:24,369
settled the profound issues I think

1355
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,710
we're going to have some wake-up moments

1356
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:29,890
because of some incidents that are

1357
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:32,440
coming and once again you know I'd like

1358
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:36,759
the foot stop I think that we all have a

1359
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,710
stake in making sure that our voices are

1360
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,500
heard as far as what our expectations

1361
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:44,440
are both in the marketplace as well as

1362
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,700
the legislative and governmental type so

1363
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,290
I think there's three things here to

1364
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,859
wrap up with from the panel

1365
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:53,800
the first is those of you hear a lot of

1366
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:55,240
challenges a lot of opportunities this

1367
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,880
is a great field to be in I think all

1368
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,669
all agree to that second it's fairly

1369
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,440
clear that our three experts here all

1370
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:08,859
have a very different conception of what

1371
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:11,200
60 seconds means who's goes back and the

1372
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:13,180
first conclusion is that there is hope

1373
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,520
for the future you don't need to move

1374
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,259
out into the wilderness and learn how to

1375
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,770
catch your own food unless you really

1376
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,050
want to but take advantage of some of

1377
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:24,849
those opportunities and please take

1378
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:27,540
advantage of this opportunity to thank

1379
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,540
the panel

1380
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,960
you
