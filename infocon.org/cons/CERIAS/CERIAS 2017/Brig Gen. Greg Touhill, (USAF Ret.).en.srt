1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,920
it was pointed out to me I didn't

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,440
introduce myself when I came up the

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,750
first time and and that's because I

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,369
think I know most of you and most of you

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,619
know me I am either Jean spafford or a

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:24,810
modestly well working AI simulation

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:27,150
thereof and I'm sort of the corporate

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,509
memory of this organization now in some

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:36,060
regards and and that's where I'll reach

10
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:39,630
for introducing our first keynote when

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,840
we were sort of planning these events on

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,060
a yearly basis to both expose our

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,510
students and faculty to research going

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,970
on outside and also to have people

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,760
outside for you find out more about what

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,190
we were doing here at the University we

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,739
structured the symposia around the idea

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,370
of some selected keynotes where we'd

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,350
reach out to distinguish individuals

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,450
representing a government representing

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,649
industry and representing the practice

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,850
and so each year for the past in years

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,800
for n a small number we have sent out

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,309
these invitations and we have been very

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,658
fortunate to you have people come to

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,310
represent those various sectors for the

27
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,159
industry side we've managed to attract

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,880
CEOs and CTOs of international

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,710
organizations individuals who've gone

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,500
from startups to multi-million dollar

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,960
companies and they've been very happy to

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,790
share their expertise with us on the

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,899
government side we have been able to

34
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,049
attract presidential advisers cabinet

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,170

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,570
we've had some wonderful speakers in

40
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,080

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,900
story i'm not going to relate all of it

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,600
here but as a result of a missile launch

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,000
gone awry he decided it might be safer

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,350

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,980
turned on alright thumbs up in the back

72
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,530
I'm going to put the hands held down yet

73
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,470
to complete the story I would say like a

74
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,209
third lieutenant intern at the rocket

75
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,580
propulsion lab at Edwards Air Force Base

76
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,090
between my junior and senior year I saw

77
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,150
an o-ring burned through on the solid

78
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,170
rocket fuel booster and frankly I didn't

79
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,030
like the people I was going to be

80
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,458
working with and I was going to go there

81
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,459
as a second lieutenant and the only way

82
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:10,130
I could escape that assignment was to

83
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,989
not take a Bachelors of Science and with

84
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,230
the support of my father and the colonel

85
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,700
I flip flop my major in my minor and the

86
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,418
Air Force didn't know what to do with me

87
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:23,690
so they put me in this new field called

88
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:25,310
computers and electronics and the rest

89
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,960
is history I never went back I mean

90
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,910
credit short of chemical engineering and

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,130
I'm not going back and funny too because

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,860
my father's got PhD in engineering he

93
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,469
really really wanted me to go there but

94
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,780
no I made the right choice i think it

95
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,419
was a divine inspiration today i would

96
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,450
like we've got a choice and i'd like to

97
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:50,090
do a quick poll as a former government

98
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,909
official i have been trained to stand

99
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,330
behind the podium and read to you a

100
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,539
speech how many want that kind of

101
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,370

102
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,680

103
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,350

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,560
caffeine he's ready

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,050
how many folks want to have a

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,270
conversation about cyber okay great

109
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,460
alright so today what I'd like to do is

110
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,219
this I'd like to share some of my life

111
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,409
lessons on cyber security and the first

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:30,060
thing is cyber is not a technology issue

113
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,400
technology ism most important part of

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,729
that I might my view as a technologist

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,229
but it's not the only part at its heart

116
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:42,659
cyber security is a risk management

117
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:45,409
issue it's all about risk and you know

118
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,250
why should you care about cybersecurity

119
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,830
well I've been asked that question

120
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,770
throughout my professional career and a

121
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,318
lot of different fora and you know I

122
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,750
talk about it as a risk management issue

123
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,330
and it starts getting the attention of

124
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,380
directors of companies there you know

125
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:08,250
cabinet officials it gets the attention

126
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,169
of the c-suite as well and I think it's

127
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,530
really important that all of us be

128
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,750
prepared to make the business case for

129
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,429
what we're doing in cybersecurity

130
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,530
because the decision makers who allocate

131
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,449
resources are critically important and

132
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,388
making sure that you're able to follow

133
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:28,560
through because if it ain't funded it

134
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:34,889
ain't so anybody know who this this

135
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:37,919
picture represents this is Sunzu okay

136
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,969
sunzu and adds a war college graduate

137
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm obliged in every speech to refer to

138
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:51,270
Sunzu and quote a dead German so sunzu

139
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,969
said if you know your enemy and you know

140
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,210
yourself in a thousand battles you shall

141
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:59,729
not be vanquished today what I'd like to

142
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,120
do is walk through some of the lessons

143
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:04,949
learned as to knowing yourself as well

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,259
as knowing your enemy and give you some

145
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,430
tips that maybe you will be helpful for

146
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,740
you as you're putting together a

147
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:15,360
cybersecurity program to better manage

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,919
your risk and as you go into that why

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,289
should you really be paying attention

150
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,469
two sons ooh well the first thing is

151
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,469
this information is an asset people want

152
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,770
to get your assets so you got to cover

153
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:30,479
your

154
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:33,448
asset you need to protect your

155
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,669
information because information is at

156
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,460
the center of every one of your missions

157
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,650
your operations it's your intellectual

158
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,469
property it's your brand and reputation

159
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,878
it's the privacy of yourself and your

160
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:50,580
clients your integrity your trust levels

161
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,500
safety competitive advantage all of

162
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,419
those all of the above are now wrapped

163
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,610
into your cyber security posture you

164
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,740
can't operate a business you can't

165
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,030
operate a government you can't operate a

166
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,270
household without having a solid

167
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,270
cybersecurity program in place think

168
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:16,229
about that Home Office and everywhere in

169
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,030
between and now with such legislation as

170
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,650
sarbanes-oxley and some of the new

171
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,359
legislation that's come out for

172
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:27,508
corporate responsibility do care and due

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,560
diligence is also part of the

174
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:35,099
cybersecurity lexicon if you are not

175
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,860
practicing best practices in managing

176
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,079
your information you expose yourself as

177
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,079
a business to calls that you are not

178
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,910
practicing do care and due diligence

179
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:47,520
which now under the legal construct

180
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,560
carries with it a heavy burden for the

181
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,040
officers and the directors of companies

182
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,800
as you go in and you talk to the head

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,779
shed make sure that you do a little bit

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,300
of homework on what constitutes do care

185
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,839
and due diligence and put your language

186
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,550
in their language okay don't get hung up

187
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,290
on the technical terms because it'll

188
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,029
just cause the eyes to roll in the back

189
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,490
of their heads they won't really care

190
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,459
when you get into your inner geek what

191
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:18,350
they do care is when their bacon is on

192
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:22,219
the line make the business case now

193
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,709
here's a interesting a little slide

194
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:28,410
frankly I've gone through in my military

195
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,719
career and my government career and

196
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,640
working with the private sector I see a

197
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,100
lot of folks put out for both tones

198
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,750
spelling out strategies strategy for

199
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,780
this or strategy for that

200
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,540
I'll tell you that anybody who puts out

201
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,550
a lengthy strategy book is fooling

202
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,160
themselves because very few people have

203
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,900
the time or patience to read them what

204
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,780
was our strategy in World War two hold

205
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:01,970
in the Pacific when in Europe go back

206
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,740
and defeat the Japanese in the Pacific

207
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:09,510
that was our grand strategy hold win win

208
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,340
every soldier sailor Airman and marine

209
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,650
knew that strategy everybody at home

210
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,470
knew that strategy everybody was coming

211
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,020
together what's our cybersecurity

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,140
strategy for your different

213
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,920
organizations that you work with anybody

214
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,400
bueller bueller anybody well you know

215
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,640
when I came in as the federal see so our

216
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,520
strategy was codified in a lengthy tome

217
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,780
that very few folks outside of academia

218
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,060
and policy walks actually read and it

219
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,810
was increasingly difficult to articulate

220
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,430
in different circles within the federal

221
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,719
government so I came out and I put

222
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,280
together a strategy five sentences

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,460
because if the troops can't articulate

224
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,810
the strategy it doesn't get done first

225
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,820
part of that strategy harden the

226
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,030
workforce everybody's on the cyber front

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,339
lines right Home Office everybody needs

228
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,760
to be cyber aware you don't need to be a

229
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,550
cyber expert and you know all the secret

230
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,930
cyber ninja stuff you don't have to be a

231
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,030
cissp or cism to be cyber aware you know

232
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:22,589
for crying out loud mom don't click that

233
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:26,060
link to you have to treat information as

234
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,040
an asset right information is an asset

235
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,410
three you've got to do the right things

236
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,560
the right way and arguably at the right

237
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,500
time for continuously innovate and

238
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,969
invest wisely you know we've got to

239
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,280
introduce into the federal government

240
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,650
that's really groundbreaking concept

241
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,550
called depreciation and recapitalization

242
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,380
of IT assets and then the fifth one is

243
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,750
we got to make informed cyber risk

244
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,339
decisions at the right level too often

245
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,760
folks were seeing the leaders were

246
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,880
kicking

247
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,060
decisions to the kids in the server room

248
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,500
and you know what it wasn't working so

249
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,030
from a strategy standpoint five

250
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,130
sentences make sense you know we fleshed

251
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,199
it out too because the strategy that

252
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:15,390
doesn't get executed is just shelf where

253
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,220
so we actually put goals that were

254
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,600
feasible acceptable suitable and

255
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,660
affordable along with them unfortunately

256
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,010
often we have when the new teams come in

257
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,390
they throw out the old strategies and

258
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,970
they got to go create their new ones

259
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,580
let's see how the new strategy compares

260
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,580
to that strategy as it's coming forward

261
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,340
but in the past the government went out

262
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,160
and bought everything you know and

263
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,170
frankly one of the things that as I came

264
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,600
out of the military and then to DHS is

265
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,569
the deputy assistant secretary we didn't

266
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,220
know all the stuff we had you're not so

267
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,080
one of the things we did is under the

268
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,870
continuous diagnostics and mitigation

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,960
program which is a six billion dollar

270
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:01,020
program one of the first things we did

271
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:05,010
is we put together a strategic construct

272
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,170
to it know what you have you know what's

273
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,200
on your network who's on your network

274
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,689
and what's going on in your network

275
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,820
three strategic lines of effort known

276
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,530
what's on your network turns out to be

277
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,060
and we knew that it was a mess dog's

278
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,660
breakfast you never knew what you're

279
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,130
going to find and we found that just in

280
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,490
the first pass and putting discovery

281
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,200
tools on government networks we found 77

282
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,060
million dollars worth of additional

283
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,430
equipment that the departments and

284
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,380
agencies didn't even know they had and I

285
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,370
think that number is going to go way way

286
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,140
up strategy matters but it's got to be

287
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,520
clear and concise as you're putting

288
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,250
together the strategies for your

289
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,860
organization put it language that

290
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,320
everyone understands bounce it off of

291
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:53,730
your mom if your mom understands your

292
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,140
strategy you're making a good start all

293
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,590
right let's see if I can't get this to

294
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,540
move all right anybody know this group

295
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:06,090
here these are the flying will lend us

296
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,500
do you think that every single one of

297
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,590
them

298
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,530
those where their risks are I would

299
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,900
submit the answer is yes we all need to

300
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,790
make sure that we understand our risk

301
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,699
and against in with the hardening the

302
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,560
workforce standpoint this is not just an

303
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,460
IT issue when we talk about

304
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,800
cybersecurity it is a business issue

305
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:32,730
everybody has a stake in it so you need

306
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,620
to culturally address cybersecurity from

307
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,840
the top of the organization all the way

308
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,840
down and in the federal government one

309
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,770
of the things that really irked my well

310
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,580
let's just say didn't make me happy was

311
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:50,670
we did just one and done training and

312
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:53,310
you know the annual watch a stupid video

313
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,439
and I pick you know sometimes you took

314
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,170
that sometimes you did one and done

315
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,490
training doesn't work folks and one of

316
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,370
the things that we tried putting into

317
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,010
the budget that just came out with some

318
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,070
additional training and exercises

319
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:11,550
because if you don't exercise you don't

320
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:15,420
succeed how many folks know who Knute

321
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,089
Rockne was famous Indiana coach right he

322
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,219
said practice makes perfect right how

323
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,640
about Vince Lombardi what did he say he

324
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,310
said Rockne was wrong Vince Lombardi

325
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:31,740
said perfect practice makes perfect and

326
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:34,109
whose names on the trophy now as you're

327
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,960
going through and building your program

328
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,600
make sure that you focus on the culture

329
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,660
and make sure that everyone knows what

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,230
the risks are because all it takes is

331
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,380
one stupid person I'm sorry I went

332
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:54,330
through government counseling uh one ill

333
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,850
informed and unmotivated person to you

334
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:03,930
know to trip on the wire and take

335
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:07,280
everybody down now Sunzu say it's

336
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:12,420
critically important to know your enemy

337
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:14,640
who's your enemy ok you know training

338
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,979
camps going to be happening and you know

339
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,150
I think Andrew Luck is probably looking

340
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,500
at this guy and saying hmm

341
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:27,140
this is somebody who's on my watch list

342
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,860
okay everybody knows who Tom Brady is

343
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:34,610
right yeah I'm from Pittsburgh we know

344
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,680
who he is what do you need to know about

345
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,530
your enemy well first of all you need to

346
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,989
identify who they are and you need to

347
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,480
understand what their motivations are

348
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,950
and why they may act against you and

349
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,580
what kind of information would they be

350
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,170
secant that you possess you need to know

351
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,720
what their objectives are and their

352
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,479
capabilities you know there's some

353
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,180
people who are still wanna be's do you

354
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,030
give them as much attention as those who

355
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,410
have more capabilities this audience

356
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,319
participation is where you give the

357
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:10,190
resounding no okay you got to know your

358
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,470
enemies you also need to understand

359
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,690
their patterns of behavior their attack

360
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,459
vectors their typical plans and the

361
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,570
light and through information sharing

362
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,430
and I'll talk a little bit more about

363
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,849
that you certainly can get that

364
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,500
information even when some folks say oh

365
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,329
well that's classified I can't tell you

366
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,740
yeah there's ways to get that

367
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,570
information and that's one of the things

368
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,420
that I think the government does a

369
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,610
crummy job on is the intelligence

370
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,900
community's will classify everything top

371
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,449
secret sensitive compartmented

372
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,670
information as a default one of the

373
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,010
things I tried doing is turning the

374
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,900
tables and say everything's unclassified

375
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,440
because pulling it off the internet you

376
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:52,010
got to prove why it has to be secret you

377
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,710
know top secret etc but know who your

378
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,230
enemies are investing business

379
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,120
intelligence invest in information

380
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,730
sharing because if you don't know who

381
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,459
your enemies are at sunzu would say you

382
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,130
will be vanquished now there's a lot of

383
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,780
threats in your neighborhood okay so

384
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,500
here are some of the typical types of

385
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,360
enemies that I see out there and when I

386
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,390
retired from the Air Force a friend of

387
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,129
mine gave me a laser pointer that looks

388
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,980
like a bullet it's great going through

389
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,350
TSA with this

390
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,890
ok so I would submit that the first

391
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:31,250
enemy that you've got a plan for our

392
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:33,110
vandals okay vandals are folks that are

393
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,900
going to come by and there it gotten

394
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,510
agenda they're going to come for example

395
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,559
to your website and friend of mine Geary

396
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,360
harbison is the C so at Monsanto every

397
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,730
time Monsanto comes out with a new

398
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,520
formulation of roundup guess what

399
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,380
happens they know that they're going to

400
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,059
have some folks often it's going to be

401
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,710
anonymous they're going to come in and

402
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,629
they're going to try to deface their

403
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:00,200
website impugning their brand and

404
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,000
reputation Monsanto plans for that and

405
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,260
can do a wipe and reload in about 20

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,300
seconds or less and they have

407
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,990
competitions to see who can detect and

408
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,840
do the wipe and reload and you know if

409
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,990
they reward those who are active on

410
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,899
their team but they note that threat is

411
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,650
out there who are the Vandals in your

412
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,150
neighborhood what about burglars

413
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:26,300
burglars they're financially motivated

414
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,880
they're crooks and you don't have to

415
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,210
have the name that ends and off or ski

416
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,490
to be a burglar you know my friends in

417
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,530
the FBI and the Secret Service they're

418
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,960
tracking burglars you know criminals

419
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,270
that are financially motivated around

420
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,670
the world here in the United States as

421
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,730
well as overseas you know frankly the

422
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,460
ones overseas generally get a little bit

423
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,900
more safe haven in some places that then

424
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,020
they get here in the United States and

425
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,760
computer crime in the United States is

426
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,309
actually pretty sophisticated but it's

427
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
not as pernicious and prevalent as what

428
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:02,750
we're seeing from overseas sources and

429
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,889
for those folks who think that the bad

430
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,780
guys overseas get away look up on on

431
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,240
your favorite browser sometime later

432
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,940
tonight Victor drinkman Victor drinkman

433
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,190
ripped off a couple of you know dozens

434
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,559
of the millions of dollars from some

435
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,340
financial institutions from his safe

436
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,860
haven in Eastern Europe but Victor and

437
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,860
his young bride decided that they wanted

438
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,379
to take a newlywed trip to Amsterdam

439
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,949
home of some of the greatest artworks in

440
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,040
the world and some pretty liberal laws

441
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,350
regarding

442
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,020
cot x and other things and they were

443
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,780
going to take a great vacation so Victor

444
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,600
and his new wife they get to Amsterdam

445
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,290
they pull out the cell phone and they

446
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,189
take a selfie and post it on their

447
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,649
facebook and what did the victor fail to

448
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,660
do we forgot to put off geo-tagging he

449
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,330
forgot that the Secret Service which

450
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,260
does financial crime is like monitoring

451
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:09,330
you know Facebook and looking for him

452
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:13,220
all it took was that post an alert

453
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:15,689
Secret Service agent a phone call to the

454
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,820
authorities there in Amsterdam and

455
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:22,230
Victor won an all-expense-paid trip to

456
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,790
New Jersey you know the United States

457
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,360
government is serious about this and

458
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,190
we'll track down these folks even if it

459
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,649
takes three years like it did Victor

460
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,120
drinkin or more but burglars are out

461
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,130
there and you got a plan for them and

462
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,040
they financially motivated and there's

463
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:43,230
big money in this game now how about you

464
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:46,139
know the the spies that are out there do

465
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,660
you think that these spies are the most

466
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,450
prevalent I think there's two types of

467
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,790
spice there's the nation-state spies but

468
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,300
then there's also and those that are

469
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:59,639
seeking intellectual property theft and

470
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,980
they're pretty prevalent and you know

471
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,560
just ask some folks from the CIA or the

472
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,430
NSA over the last couple of weeks about

473
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,470
spies what about your business what kind

474
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,840
of intellectual property do you have and

475
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,940
who has access to it what data loss

476
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,399
prevention systems do you have in place

477
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,160
I would submit that if you take a look

478
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,150
at the Edward Snowden and the Bradley

479
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,980
Manning cases both of them could have

480
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,290
been thwarted by more effective

481
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:33,630
frontline supervision not necessarily a

482
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:36,030
technical technical but frontline

483
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,260
supervision what are you doing to train

484
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:44,129
your frontline supervisors to thwart

485
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,590
insider threats and spying something to

486
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,180
think about something to implement about

487
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,629
muggers do you think that there's

488
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,180
internet

489
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,010
muggers out there I certainly submit

490
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,960
that there are and it goes beyond just

491
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:59,580
the high school bullying that's out

492
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,040
there do you think that the folks at

493
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,010
Sony motion pictures felt that they got

494
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,450
mugged by North Korea yeah I'll

495
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,300
definitely tell you that they thought

496
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,000
they got mugged in some regards though I

497
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,500
gotta tell you and this is not a an

498
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,060
official stance of the United States

499
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,300
government or endorsed by the

500
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,440
Commissioner Major League Baseball but

501
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,070
frankly I think the North Koreans did

502
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,330
Sony a favor because I don't think many

503
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,460
people were going to go watch that movie

504
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:31,620
you know but once they hacked in boy we

505
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,520
were doing in the end kick the national

506
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,820
cybersecurity and communications

507
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,250
integration Center where I served as the

508
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,290
director you know we had us-cert the

509
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,590
industrial control system cert and a

510
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,020
host of alphabet soup pretty important

511
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,000
entities in the end kick we did the

512
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,879
double feature of team america followed

513
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,490
by the interview gfb cuts were Americans

514
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,130
right but there's muggers out there you

515
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,720
got a plan for that those are part of

516
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,640
your enemies that you've got to

517
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,240
understand they're out there I think

518
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,750
saboteurs and you guys recognize to me

519
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,430
Timothy Olyphant from the arguably the

520
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,430
one of the worst die hard movies ever

521
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:17,820
who are the saboteurs you know saboteurs

522
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,810
are pretty pernicious but they're very

523
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:24,000
difficult to detect you never want to

524
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,590
have a single point of failure when

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,890
you're designing or architecting your

526
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,570
networks or your information stores but

527
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,240
you have to understand you've got to

528
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,790
build in according to the cybersecurity

529
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,430
framework the resiliency to take a punch

530
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:41,310
and keep on going you have to be able to

531
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:43,050
survive a saboteur and there will be a

532
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:48,360
saboteur at some point out there and

533
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:50,100
that saboteur could be deliberate or the

534
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,029
greatest threat that's out there the

535
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,748
careless negligent or indifferent

536
00:24:54,029 --> 00:25:00,479
now that's a of course Jim Carrey and

537
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:04,379
his sidekick Jeff Daniels from dumb and

538
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:06,749
dumber I would submit that over

539
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,899
eighty-five percent of the incidents

540
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:12,149
that my teams in the US cert and the

541
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:15,268
industrial control system cert responded

542
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:18,209
to were the result of careless negligent

543
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,309
or indifferent people I'll repeat that

544
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,879
eighty-five percent the result of

545
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:26,399
careless negligent or indifferent people

546
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:28,049
now I used to append stupid but those

547
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,869
years of government training and

548
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:34,619
counseling came into play and I was told

549
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:35,879
not to mention stupid again but wait a

550
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,718
minute I'm no longer in the government

551
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:41,459
ya plan for stupid alright that's going

552
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:43,700
to be your number one risk factor to be

553
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,929
perfectly honest to typically speaking

554
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,659
careless negligence and indifferent

555
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,899
people offer a great threat risk

556
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:54,509
exposure you need to plan for it and how

557
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:57,619
do you mitigate some of that through

558
00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:00,299
education and training and exercising

559
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:04,889
practice makes perfect but perfect

560
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:06,418
practice makes perfect ok let's see if I

561
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:08,998
can get this to advance I got a step

562
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,389
back there we go here's some other

563
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:15,509
threats that are out there I'm not going

564
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:18,539
to delve into these but physical threats

565
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:21,299
remain an issue that we all have to plan

566
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,099
against geography matters you know for

567
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,389
example I consulted with a company that

568
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:30,539
is in the greater Phoenix area and one

569
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:32,849
of the reasons they picked that place

570
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:36,059
for their data storage location is

571
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:39,089
seismically it's not very active there

572
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:40,979
if you go to Phoenix good luck getting

573
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:42,658
any seismic activity only seismic

574
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:44,729
activity you're going to get there sonic

575
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:48,779
booms from Luke Air Force Base and they

576
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:50,489
have water uh you know this right here I

577
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,859
used to be commander of Keesler Air

578
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:55,619
Force Base that's the comp Center at

579
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,019
Keesler Air Force Base I was sent in as

580
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:01,879
a commander after Hurricane Katrina and

581
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:06,029
they were ten miles east of Ground Zero

582
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:07,439
and my job was to not only continue to

583
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,750
train and educate airman

584
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,320
to rebuild the base it's amazing what a

585
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,820
billion dollars will do folks you know

586
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,860
if you're living on the Gulf Coast you

587
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,110
got a plan for hurricanes if you're

588
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,350
living here in the Midwest tornadoes

589
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,309
those California you know what gets what

590
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:29,219
California is thinking about earthquakes

591
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:32,490
there's a Fukushima if you're living

592
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,529
near nuclear reactor don't necessarily

593
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,740
feel comfortable if it's on a seismic

594
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:42,059
location on the coast where there could

595
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:44,480
be a tsunami who would know right don't

596
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:47,009
forget to about your paper records

597
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,889
cybersecurity isn't just the ones and

598
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:52,019
zeros it's all about the information

599
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:54,719
down in the lower corner corner and I

600
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:59,100
don't think everybody can see this is a

601
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,440
the residual detris from the devastating

602
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,860
fire at the National Archive in Seattle

603
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,809
upon me in st. Louis a lot of World War

604
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,928
two veterans all of their records were

605
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:13,340
in st. Louis and hard copy format there

606
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:16,259
was no backup for that information and a

607
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,928
fire went through and destroyed all the

608
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:23,129
paper records my uncle dick is going to

609
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:24,929
be interred in arlington on may fit he

610
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:28,529
died he was World War two fighter pilot

611
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:30,629
it took us quite a while to get his

612
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:33,600
records together so that we in fact

613
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:36,750
prove that he was a World War two

614
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,600
veteran you got to figure of your paper

615
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:42,210
records as well as part of your your

616
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,100
backup strategy and then of course you

617
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,049
know for those of us who have spent some

618
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,779
time in the Great Pacific Northwest you

619
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:51,269
know there's mount st. Helens are you

620
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:54,389
ready for when the next big volcanic

621
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:57,960
eruption occurs plan for all of your

622
00:28:54,389 --> 00:29:00,539
threats as if they were an enemy I think

623
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,669
it's important to that you participate

624
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:06,509
in what I call the cyber neighborhood

625
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:08,879
watch I I coined this phrase when I was

626
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,379
at DHS because I think it's really

627
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:12,719
important that we all think of ourselves

628
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:14,850
like a neighborhood watch when it comes

629
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,379
to cyber if you don't know what's going

630
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,509
on in your neighborhood you can you're

631
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,250
going to be victimized one of the things

632
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,210
that I did while I was at Homeland

633
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,000
Security

634
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,919
when it came to information sharing is I

635
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,510
tried building that culture with my

636
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,000
folks so that we could in fact share

637
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,370
information in a manner that people

638
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,460
would understand but also protect the

639
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:38,070
identities of the victims so if a guy

640
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,399
like Greg comes into Gary's neighborhood

641
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,950
and I come in at two o'clock every

642
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,689
afternoon it's a gated community too by

643
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,000
the way let's say it's all of our

644
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,620
neighborhood and there's the gate Greg

645
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,750

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:11,730
know yourself can you guys see what's

697
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,740
behind these divers for those who can't

698
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,399
we've got two divers there with a great

699
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,590
white right behind them and the the

700
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:21,389
fraser says situational awareness yeah

701
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,860
it's important when you want to know if

702
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,309
there is a great white behind you I

703
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,219
think so I think it's critically

704
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,899
important that you'd know yourself and

705
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,850
don't take a look just at the technology

706
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,699
understand the business and the culture

707
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,899
of the organization that you're in

708
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,510
understand your information the

709
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:41,789
architecture upon which it's stored the

710
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,908
hardware and the software tools that are

711
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:48,059
used to store maintain retrieve archive

712
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:50,070
etc you have to understand the workforce

713
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:53,399
and their talents and their weaknesses

714
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:56,070
and here's some foot stomping stuff this

715
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:57,989
is where you take notes better

716
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:02,100
understand your suppliers and your

717
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:04,350
third-party chains and your you also

718
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,029
need to understand the strengths and

719
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,309
weaknesses of your third-party vendors

720
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:13,230
and a lot of folks leave that by the

721
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:15,059
wayside with really bad results OPM the

722
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:20,490
Office of Personnel Management anybody

723
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:22,289
hear them OPM got breached because a

724
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,020
third party vendor that was doing

725
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:30,860
background investigations private

726
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:35,360
company they they had a investigator who

727
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:39,000
in short the evidence points towards the

728
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:43,350
investigator took his laptop plugged

729
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,360
into a dirty network was compromised and

730
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:50,100
then the adversary set used the user

731
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,020
name and password credentials of that

732
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,919
background investigator to come in

733
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,920
through the back door to OPM and the

734
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,740
investor you know the investigation

735
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,080
indicates that the adversary understood

736
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,390
the business process that was being

737
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,949
followed and came looking feeling and

738
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:13,050
acting like a legitimate user now

739
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:15,149
frankly in my view is they probably

740
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,720
could have and should have detected the

741
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:22,888
bulk transfers a lot better but

742
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,719
nonetheless you know frankly username

743
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,080
and password with state of the art and

744
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,069
80s why are we still using it now and

745
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,580
that's something you could talk about

746
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,389
later today all right knowing yourself

747
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:38,129
really starts with your information

748
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,500
Napoleon said where is ninety percent

749
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:42,629
information I'm checking another box in

750
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,659
my ear War College requirement I'm

751
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:49,440
quoting a dead general but how much is

752
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:52,320
your information valued where is your

753
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,340
information who has access to it do you

754
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,260
know yourself most folks do not and most

755
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,330
folks are hoarders they're going to be

756
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,180
on the Discovery Channel where folks are

757
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,490
going to buy stuff we'll open up the

758
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,250
information faults and find all sorts of

759
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,810
stuff but they didn't know they have we

760
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,880
see it all the time both in the public

761
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:14,850
and private sector take a look at your

762
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,810
own gmail account how many folks don't

763
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:23,759
delete things from their their Gmail or

764
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:26,880
the yahoo hotmail outlook 365 you know

765
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,420
because they don't have to storage is

766
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:34,470
cheap right so why delete how many of

767
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:39,960
you are guilty how many of you are not

768
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:41,368
honest okay all right another thing to

769
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,390
as you're taking a look at knowing

770
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:47,520
yourself beware the good idea fairies

771
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,140
there are so many folks who have

772
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,280
declared themselves cybersecurity

773
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,868
experts who wouldn't be able to pour

774
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,700
something out of a boot if the

775
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,130
instructions were written on the heel I

776
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:02,098
was at a forum in fairfax county

777
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,549
virginia at the beginning of the month

778
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,680
and folks were looking it was an

779
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:09,809
entrepreneurship summit where they were

780
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,249
trying to bring folks in to teach him

781
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:16,019
how to create their own business and

782
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:17,759
this woman came in and she said she was

783
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:22,169
starting up a cyber security business

784
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:24,779
and she arrived fashionably late which

785
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,789
was really appreciated by most of the

786
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,039
folks in the room but when they asked

787
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:32,009
her why you know what credentials she

788
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,630
brought to the table she said well I see

789
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:37,170
it as a growing field I'm an attorney

790
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:39,119
and I see some opportunity there you

791
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,130
know that's kind of cool if you are a

792
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,109
lawyer and you specialize in certain

793
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:48,869
stuff but you know what when it comes to

794
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:53,430
what we do for a living make sure that

795
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:54,960
you are you dig deeper when you've got

796
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,509
these folks that are claiming themselves

797
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,390
to be experts I frankly was raised by

798
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:03,450
parents who told me anybody who declares

799
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,828
himself an expert isn't but there are a

800
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,118
lot of good idea fairies who are going

801
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:09,059
to come around they're going to try to

802
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:13,140
sell you the latest tool or the the

803
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:15,779
latest hardware solution aight demanding

804
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,049
customer and if anybody says they got a

805
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:21,089
silver bullet to solve this problem i

806
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:22,559
contend that they're wrong there's a lot

807
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:24,569
of different you're going to have to

808
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,650
spend a lot of bullets in order to

809
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:31,160
better manage your risk now I did

810
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,569
mention as part of the strategy that

811
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,308
continuously innovating and investing

812
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:38,069
wisely is critically important that was

813
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:41,579
part of our strategy and age does matter

814
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:45,390
in our business now I introduced the

815
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:49,499
concept that I called to Hills law in

816
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:51,629
talking with the the folks in the senior

817
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:53,598
levels of government week I would go in

818
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,609
every month and I would brief the

819
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,890
president's Management Council which is

820
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:01,440
one layer down below the cabinet it's

821
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,569
basically the deputy secretaries and we

822
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,660
are trying to get a three billion dollar

823
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:08,910
IT working capital fund to replace a lot

824
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,288
of old computers I had to put it in

825
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,719
terms that they could understand so I

826
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:15,720
created well even when I was in military

827
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,609
created this call to Hills law so

828
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,279
me explain what two hills law is because

829
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:22,259
you may want to use it someday how many

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,520
folks have heard one human year equals

831
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,780
seven dog years come on it's Indiana I

832
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,150
always thought to be a whole lot more on

833
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,650
that one yeah I'm from Pittsburgh that's

834
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,290
a midwest city it's west of the

835
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,810
Alleghenies all right so one human year

836
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:41,609
equals seven dog years how about anybody

837
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:43,349
here of Microsoft never right well

838
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:45,180
Microsoft and great American companies

839
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:48,180
like it typically come out every three

840
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,419
years with a generational leap forward

841
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,339
right and then health and human services

842
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,010
department says the average lifespan in

843
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,690
the United States 78.7 years I'm going

844
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:03,690
around that 275 because it makes the

845
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:06,030
math easier 75 / 3 equals what 25 so

846
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:10,410
therefore under two Hills law one human

847
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:13,380
year equals 25 computer years I'll let

848
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,710
that sink in for a moment one human year

849
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,450
equals 25 computer years so I would

850
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,800
contend that if you do the math you've

851
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,040
got a four year old computer it's about

852
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,270
a hundred years old ladies and gentlemen

853
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,250
in the federal government we had several

854
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:31,400
computers that were well over thousands

855
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,869
of years old I found one computer in a

856
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:38,240
certain space agency that was

857
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:40,560
commissioned in 1964 and of course

858
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,180
somebody decided hey this needs to be

859
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,700
internet-facing so we're going to bold

860
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,529
something on so I would go into board

861
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,319
meetings the president's Management

862
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:56,160
Council and I'd say look here's a Wright

863
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,280
Flyer circa 1903 we're putting ripe

864
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,310
flutters up against MiG's and a new

865
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,400
Chinese jade j-20 which looks

866
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:08,910
surprisingly a lot like a some of our

867
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,040
aircraft how about your infrastructure

868
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:15,390
if you're making a business case for

869
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,910
security you need to be current and it's

870
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,799
not just current with your equipment its

871
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,410
current with your software its current

872
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,130
with your people and training your

873
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,190
technicians never stops you have to

874
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,240
factor that into your business case

875
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,609
you have to know yourself now a lot of

876
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,740
folks are flying into the clouds right

877
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,560
now and i'll tell you i I've actually

878
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,149
lost some friends who flew into clouds

879
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,849
only define it as a mountain on the

880
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:49,369
other side literally by the way that's

881
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:52,310
me and when I go and I talked with folks

882
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:55,069
about cloud computing I'm a big fan I

883
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,810
really am a big fan but you have to go

884
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:59,420
in with your eyes wide open and you need

885
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:02,509
to know what's on the other side we had

886
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,790
a lot of government agencies and I saw

887
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,609
this in the private sector as well who

888
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,880
ran into contracts cloud computing

889
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:12,348
contracts because everybody said hey it

890
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,329
so that the latest and greatest newest

891
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:16,280
coolest thing but they didn't put

892
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:19,730
portability into their contract so when

893
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,829
the contract came up when they go for a

894
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,480
rebid they could get a better deal

895
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,589
somewhere else but what about taking

896
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,180
that information putting it over oh so

897
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:31,819
here's a couple of lessons learned as

898
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,828
you're going to do a cloud computing

899
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:37,099
contract security needs to be part of

900
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:39,800
the requirement set portability needs to

901
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:42,680
be part of your requirement you need to

902
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,650
retain the ability to do independent

903
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,960
third-party auditing to make sure they

904
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,980
in fact are meeting your requirements

905
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,720
particularly when it comes to security

906
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:56,510
do not route do not relinquish your

907
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,910
ability to conduct pen testing during

908
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,950
the life of that contract as well

909
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,660
there's a lot of companies that are

910
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,930
going to bristle at that but you know

911
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,220
what if we all make it a requirement

912
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,740
then they're going to wake up and smell

913
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,160
the coffee and then further make sure

914
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:16,069
that your security teams have access to

915
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,069
the logs you need to know who's trying

916
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,660
to access your information I consulted

917
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,690
with a company a financial services

918
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,029
company that had some pretty serious

919
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,069
intellectual property they went to a

920
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,050
major cloud provider they did the

921
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:32,420
boilerplate contract and I asked them

922
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:35,180
how many folks have tried getting into

923
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,480
your ear system to get your secret sauce

924
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,399
they said no I don't know you know that

925
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,880
our provider takes care of that for us

926
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,270
hello mcfly if you don't take care of

927
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,660
your own stuff the company that you're

928
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:54,870
dealing with does not maintain the

929
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,819
responsibility you can you can delegate

930
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,310
a lot of things but you can't delegate

931
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,660
the responsibility for your information

932
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:03,420
fly into the clouds with your Y eyes

933
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,190
wide open I already talked about doing

934
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,340
the right things the right way you know

935
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,770
this is than just cyber hygiene it's in

936
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,290
fact following best practices and I

937
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:16,230
would contend that compliance is not

938
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:18,690
good enough because a lot of regulations

939
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,300
and rules it takes a long time to go

940
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,100
through them compliance is important but

941
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,960
I'd rather focus on best practices

942
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,940
because best practices will bring you

943
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,880
compliance but compliance doesn't always

944
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,610
get you the best practices pay attention

945
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,670
to doing the right things the right way

946
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:37,500
and at the right time if you take a look

947
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:40,140
at the ver the leaf verizon report

948
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,830
eighty-five percent of the breaches were

949
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:47,790
caused by not patching 1010 SI VES most

950
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:50,130
of them dated back to like 2001 is that

951
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:53,490
doing do care and due diligence I don't

952
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:55,620
think so you also need to be aware of

953
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,910
your attack surface you know in the

954
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,279
federal government the current

955
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,319
architecture is like a domino ready to

956
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,730
knock over it's one of the things I

957
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,700
tried getting fixed but that's going to

958
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:07,050
be a long term project you really do

959
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,990
need to take a good look at your

960
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:13,220
architecture the 1980s organization

961
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:18,509
chart architecture does not work anymore

962
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:20,640
you need to be very very attuned to your

963
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,130
architecture and your attack surface and

964
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,390
you need to think like a hacker when

965
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,150
you're building out your new

966
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,480
capabilities every capability you and

967
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:32,220
your business put out if you're a see so

968
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,260
you need to think like a hacker how

969
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,500
could this be defeated by an adversary

970
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,750
and who are those adversaries and it's

971
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,600
part of that business case you need to

972
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,880
make sure that you're baking it in or

973
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:49,350
you've got a formal acceptance of risk

974
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,110
as part of your business case and you

975
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:53,670
also need to be a demanding customer I

976
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:55,310
don't I'm getting a little fatigued I

977
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,320
don't know about you guys I've have

978
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,299
to accept products that are coming and

979
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,050
being delivered that I'm going to have

980
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,540
to patch every single month you know

981
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:08,840
would it be better if we build quality

982
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:11,800
in from the beginning let's all be

983
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:15,290
demanding customers but recognize the

984
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,810
facts of the marketplace and then you

985
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,480
need to anticipate and innovate for some

986
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,880
folks I don't know if you can see this

987
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,880
this is a it's making its way around the

988
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,470
internet here's they drown with a

989
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,060
fishing hook on the end of it so this is

990
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,709
the next generation of what we're going

991
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,390
to see with the drums you know we're

992
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,010
going to see them do fishing expeditions

993
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:40,850
against us I guess is what some folks

994
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:42,170
are saying what's the next thing how are

995
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:45,350
you going to protect your information

996
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:49,460
are you agile are you able to identify

997
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:54,520
protect detect respond and recover so a

998
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,930
couple of parting thoughts first of all

999
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,460
don't panic it's on The Hitchhiker's

1000
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,460
Guide it's on the cover of The

1001
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,920
Hitchhiker's Guide don't panic a lot of

1002
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,500
companies are out there going oh my gosh

1003
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,840
you know the sky is falling no we're

1004
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,630
still being able to maintain the

1005
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,790
greatest economy in the world right now

1006
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:16,010
but our competitive edge and here in the

1007
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:18,650
United States is eroding we can do

1008
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,750
better and we have to do better cyber

1009
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:24,070
risk management needs to be part of an

1010
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:27,230
enterprise risk management construct and

1011
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:30,020
nothing is risk-free at some point

1012
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:33,230
you're going to have to accept and most

1013
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:37,220
folks don't recognize who the real risk

1014
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:39,110
owners are make sure that you understand

1015
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,060
how risk is managing your company and

1016
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,950
ultimately your directors and your

1017
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,380
officers of the company are the ones who

1018
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:48,470
are the ones that manage and own that

1019
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:51,110
risk but every of every one of us owns a

1020
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:54,770
stake in it also recognize there's no

1021
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:56,420
perfect model for risk management I'm

1022
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,610
one of those guys who does not believe

1023
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:02,540
that the government should dictate your

1024
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:04,550
risk posture I think that's that's wrong

1025
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:07,040
that's against the spirit of innovation

1026
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:09,530
here in the United States but don't

1027
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,180
necessarily try to reinvent the wheel

1028
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,270
go out there and be part of that

1029
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,629
information sharing you get bonus points

1030
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,730
for for copy and best practices so do

1031
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,740
some and make sure that you are

1032
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:25,310
continuously benchmarking against others

1033
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:27,200
you know I belong to a group of CISOs

1034
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,090
who continually are calling each other

1035
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,649
saying hey you know I'm running into

1036
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,990
this issue how are you guys dealing with

1037
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,090
this you know participate in those

1038
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,129
conversations and keep your leadership

1039
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,290
informed if you're one part of the tech

1040
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,900
team and if you see something say

1041
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,940
something it's critically important to

1042
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,040
keep leadership and formed up the chain

1043
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,700
but go cross and go down as well and

1044
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,830
don't be afraid to ask for help Tim the

1045
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,100
tool man Taylor I blame him for a lot of

1046
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:57,500
problems in society today because Tim

1047
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,660
the tool man Taylor didn't read the

1048
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,550
instruction book we all need to be

1049
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,089
reading the instruction book and we also

1050
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:07,730
need to be able to be strong enough to

1051
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,740
ask for help when we need it Tim didn't

1052
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,260
ask for help al Borland had to go in and

1053
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:15,140
help them out every time and then

1054
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,880
finally the enemy is dynamic you

1055
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,970
shouldn't be static you should be

1056
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,240
dynamic as well adapt improvise and

1057
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:25,129
overcome and with that we've got some

1058
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:29,660
time for a few questions does anybody

1059
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:31,730
have any questions for me yes ma'am and

1060
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,500
there's a microphone right behind you if

1061
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,500
you want to yell into that

1062
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,299
hi boy I'm definitely a younger one in

1063
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:46,740
the room so I work at eli lilly and

1064
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,230
company and i'm kind of i'm on the risk

1065
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,779
assessment scheme and you were talking

1066
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,700
about third-party vendors and how that's

1067
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,230
becoming very important to kind of know

1068
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,870
your vendor and know what risks are

1069
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,280
facing so as we're going through and

1070
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,140
assessing these fenders what are kind of

1071
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,480
the top three areas you would say to

1072
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,700
look for to make sure they're really

1073
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,320
found in their security thanks for that

1074
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,970
and the question was isn't taking a look

1075
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,090
at third party vendors what would be the

1076
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:16,939
top three things that I would look for

1077
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:20,340
first of all do they in fact have a a

1078
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:24,060
solid cybersecurity strategy that aligns

1079
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:26,070
with my own and the best practices out

1080
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,790
there and I think taking a look at the

1081
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:33,870
cybersecurity framework is part of that

1082
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:36,950
look so I would assess their strategy

1083
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:39,060
and their governance of that strategy

1084
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:42,930
through the lens of the cybersecurity

1085
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:47,730
framework that's number 12 is I would

1086
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:50,279
ask to pen test against them I'm finding

1087
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:53,280
that there are some folks that say oh I

1088
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,770
don't want to be pen tested and I've had

1089
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,750
conversations with folks as to why and

1090
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,300
the ones that are pretty confident in

1091
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:03,660
their abilities will say yeah go ahead

1092
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,630
and sometimes even if they say no

1093
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,560
because it could reveal information from

1094
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:13,590
other clients that they have it opens a

1095
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,990
conversation with them and you get a

1096
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:20,490
better sense as to their their abilities

1097
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:22,950
and then three is I would ask who

1098
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:24,839
they're third-party vendors are and how

1099
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,740
did they assess third part their own

1100
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,320
third party because they may be a third

1101
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:34,529
party to you but who are their third

1102
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,900
parties multiple back doors and trees

1103
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,730
and all all of that becomes critically

1104
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:42,320
important so those are the three that i

1105
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,320
would go with thank you thank you

1106
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:48,829
hi Chris Clifton from here at Sirius and

1107
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:51,199
you've made several statements involving

1108
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:55,130
training and additional users everybody

1109
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:57,829
needs to know the risks one of the

1110
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:59,660
problems though is all of these people

1111
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:02,059
who need to know these things have other

1112
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:06,379
jobs to do as well and they don't ask

1113
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:08,239
you to know their job how do we deal

1114
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,929
with this fact that many of the people

1115
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:13,459
that need to know things have too many

1116
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:15,829
other things they already need to know

1117
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:18,229
well you know frankly and thank you for

1118
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:24,469
that question I never asked anybody to

1119
00:51:18,229 --> 00:51:27,229
do my job but I as an executive risk is

1120
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:30,140
part of every executives job doesn't

1121
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:33,979
matter if they're a lawyer if they're an

1122
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:36,410
operations manager what you know risk is

1123
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:37,999
part of running any business and it

1124
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:40,029
doesn't matter if it's a public sector

1125
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:43,519
business or a private sector business

1126
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:44,989
putting terms putting risk in terms that

1127
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,299
people understand is critically

1128
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:49,669
important I'm not asking folks to

1129
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:52,489
understand the technical wizardry that

1130
00:51:49,669 --> 00:51:55,629
me and my team were doing but rather the

1131
00:51:52,489 --> 00:52:00,140
impact and as well as the risk exposure

1132
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:02,239
so i would i would discuss risk in terms

1133
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:05,959
that they would understand and put it in

1134
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:09,049
basically the operational cases when i

1135
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:16,279
was in the military i I made the case

1136
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:18,499
for blocking some some activities you

1137
00:52:16,279 --> 00:52:20,929
know some Facebook and some social media

1138
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:22,879
things from some of our operational

1139
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:24,769
elements and a lot of folks came in I

1140
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,849
had a forced our commander came in and

1141
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:31,879
said my last command we had access to

1142
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:36,229
facebook and you know linkedin and all

1143
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,699
of that so what i did was i first of all

1144
00:52:36,229 --> 00:52:40,669
i got with my director of intelligence

1145
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:43,099
who was picking up information from bits

1146
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:45,679
and pieces our air crews were going

1147
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:48,169
around the world delivering stuff to our

1148
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,289
troops we were able to make the business

1149
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:54,828
case from a risk perspective that would

1150
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:55,940
show that our adversaries were

1151
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:00,080
harvesting in from

1152
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:03,350
from social media and we're able to

1153
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,020
predict when that next great tale with

1154
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,330
the US flag on it was going to land at

1155
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:11,270
such-and-such a location where that ship

1156
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:14,029
was going to show up we were able to

1157
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:17,840
demonstrate how that was adding risk

1158
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:20,720
exposure so we invested to train our

1159
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,260
crews not to put information out on

1160
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,180
Facebook and the lichen and further our

1161
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,890
chief of staff said you know what you

1162
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,710
don't need facebook to do your job at

1163
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:33,109
work we're going to cut that down

1164
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,380
because frankly it was adding drag to

1165
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:38,240
our organization and our j8 our budget

1166
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,810
guy he said oh yeah because we were able

1167
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:45,709
to show the data that shows how much

1168
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:48,200
folks were spending on ESPN and you know

1169
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:50,360
some of the other stuff it was we put it

1170
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,460
in business terms we didn't put it in

1171
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,590
technical terms and we shaped the

1172
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,720
behavior we shaped investments and we

1173
00:53:54,590 --> 00:54:01,990
helped the commander make informed

1174
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,990
decisions based on his priorities thank

1175
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:19,550
thottal Boyle proud boilermaker that we

1176
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:20,899
have in the cup not anymore so you were

1177
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:25,630
talking about enterprise risk management

1178
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:28,099
yeah how does your philosophy change as

1179
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:30,920
you start to talk to smaller and smaller

1180
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:34,369
companies yeah I'm a I'm a small

1181
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,560
manufacturing firm 100 people 100

1182
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,900
employees total may have an IT manager

1183
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,299
who's a repurposed network engineer how

1184
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,369
does the conversation change well I

1185
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,440
think the strategic aspects remain

1186
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:47,660
pretty much the same time and I think it

1187
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,520
scales well you know you need to harden

1188
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,440
your work force against the threats that

1189
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,410
are out there you want everybody to

1190
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,609
pretty well know some of the rules you

1191
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:58,220
know that they should follow are you

1192
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:59,509
you're keeping them aware of you know

1193
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,430
how important it is to protect

1194
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,540
information I'd say yeah you know it

1195
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:07,720
doesn't matter if you're a single person

1196
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:11,000
proprietorship or a large multinational

1197
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,230
conglomeration to you need to be

1198
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,210
sensitive to the value of your

1199
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:15,740
information you need your secret sauce

1200
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,869
protected you know your intellectual

1201
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,339
property you know do you need to

1202
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:21,859
maintain your competitive advantage in

1203
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:23,599
the workplace and the market yeah I

1204
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:26,210
think so how about doing the right

1205
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,040
things the right way you know if when it

1206
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:29,780
comes to the technology but you know

1207
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,210
just the handling of information you

1208
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:34,670
know how many folks leave stuff out on

1209
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:36,680
their desks and then you know the

1210
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:40,430
janitorial crew comes in and can come

1211
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,930
and Hoover stuff up you know it doesn't

1212
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,240
matter the size i think it's an

1213
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,970
understanding though how to do the right

1214
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,828
things the right way that becomes a

1215
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,089
training issue which is very personal to

1216
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:52,520
and that's really a frontline

1217
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:55,599
supervision responsibility and I think

1218
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,069
that scales up and all the way down

1219
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,930
continuously innovating and investing

1220
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:03,410
wisely I think that goes with everybody

1221
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:08,509
to you know my wife just graduated from

1222
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:11,930
a flip phone to a an iphone that I got

1223
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:15,160
her and oh my gosh you know the vistas

1224
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,160
that that has opened up

1225
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:20,640
she gets it now because she sees what

1226
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:24,599
the rewards are for continuously

1227
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:28,078
innovating and investing wisely but you

1228
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:31,769
know what I've also got as my wife calls

1229
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,539
it the Starfleet bridge down in our

1230
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:37,979
basement where I've got my collection of

1231
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:40,910
computers and I am downsizing now I'm

1232
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:46,259
starting to retire on you know

1233
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:49,140
begrudgingly too but I recognize it if

1234
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:51,869
things became increasingly difficult to

1235
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:54,029
defend I just unplugged some of them and

1236
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:57,239
you know there's some games that I like

1237
00:56:54,029 --> 00:57:01,890
to play that they won't run on my new

1238
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:06,119
systems but you know what as is my needs

1239
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:08,129
grew and capabilities came out you know

1240
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,259
I went out I got some new stuff too and

1241
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:13,199
I think continuously innovating and

1242
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:15,989
investing wisely that scales up as well

1243
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,939
from the smallest to the biggest and a

1244
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:20,849
great example on that too is web

1245
00:57:17,939 --> 00:57:25,109
presence small business now you can open

1246
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:28,169
a storefront who you know just web

1247
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:30,299
presence and you know you can go through

1248
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:32,308
etsy and do things your you know at home

1249
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:34,499
and then laughing is just making

1250
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:36,269
informed cyber risk decisions at the

1251
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:39,299
right level I think that scale is

1252
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:40,948
extremely well as to you know you've got

1253
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:43,439
to make sure that everybody understands

1254
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:44,999
to risk but the risk is being the

1255
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:48,209
decisions are being made at the right

1256
00:57:44,999 --> 00:57:50,249
level and OPM was a great example where

1257
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:52,919
the folks in the server room knew that

1258
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:55,379
it was a disaster waiting to happen and

1259
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:57,900
I'm not convinced that it was fully

1260
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,630
communicated as well up the chain of

1261
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,979
command and you know one of the first

1262
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:04,619
things I did as deputy assistant

1263
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:07,198
secretary is we brought in Kathy

1264
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:11,849
Archuleta and Donna Seymour the director

1265
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:14,609
of OPM and her brand new cio and we said

1266
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:17,459
your own we had the US Surgeon there

1267
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:19,078
with the NSA and we did an evaluation we

1268
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:23,249
found the bad guys so we said your own

1269
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:25,380
big time Kathy understood the things

1270
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:27,390
were not good she didn't understand how

1271
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,500
bad they were I don't want to see

1272
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,359
another Kathy arch

1273
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,440
that take one for the team I think it's

1274
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,510
a critically important that we

1275
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,430
communicate risk we have risked

1276
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,340
conversations on a regular basis and

1277
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:44,009
those conversations go up across and

1278
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:48,560
down Thanks thanks doc it's at the hook

1279
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:48,560
Joel all right great thanks

1280
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,940
you
