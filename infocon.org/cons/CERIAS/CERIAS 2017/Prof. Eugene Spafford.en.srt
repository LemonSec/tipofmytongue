1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,269
I wanted to start with a couple things

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,080
that I forgot to mention last night

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:15,580
about the history of coasts for those of

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,140
you were there you didn't hear this

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,948
because I forgot to turn to the next

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,499
page and for those of you who missed out

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,849
last night you missed on a number of

8
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:30,820
wonderful things including all the great

9
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:34,510
posters but I wanted to mention that the

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:37,539
first graduate a PhD graduate out of the

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,089
Coast Laboratory Steve Chapin who is a

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,440
professor at Syracuse University and I

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,410
don't know if he's in the room Steve are

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,239
you here these are in the back so he

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:52,169
still remembers those student days and

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:55,870
sits in the back but Steve graduated in

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,620
1993 and was the first PhD graduate in

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,289
security after Matt Bishop who graduated

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,360
in 1984 many of you may know Matt as a

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,979
distinguished security academic

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,369
currently UC Davis Steve also is

22
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,259
responsible for the name Coast when we

23
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,299
were founding a laboratory we decided we

24
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,490
needed a good acronym to describe what

25
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,500
we're doing and to put on particularly

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,820
on government proposals it's impossible

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,479
to get a government proposal funded

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,898
unless you have an acronym and so Steve

29
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,640
took a couple of the words went home I

30
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,810
guess played with a dictionary threw

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,360
dice consulted tea leaves and came up

32
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,090
with the name Coast we as a group loved

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,460
it adopted it then we needed a logo and

34
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,509
it turns out we found that in clipart we

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:53,110
found a five and a half inch floppy disk

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,289
we stylized it turned it 45 degrees and

37
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,180
if you look back on the poster those of

38
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,820
you who ever saw a five and a half inch

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,409
floppy disk will recognize it those of

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,339
you who did not consider yourselves

41
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:09,399
lucky but it goes to the history of when

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,899
we had that kind of equipment president

43
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,290
the center we actually had systems that

44
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:17,110
booted from those lobbies and and so

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,549
that's part of the history I encourage

46
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,960
you at

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,520
some point during a break to look at

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,650
that posters see the names of some of

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,330
the people see if you recognize them see

50
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,640
the places that they went to work and

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,740
that where they had an influence it

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,690
really laid a great groundwork for what

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,690
we later came to have is serious

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,520
you
