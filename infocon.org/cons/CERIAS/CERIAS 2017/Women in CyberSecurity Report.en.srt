1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,160
those of you I haven't met yet my name

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,110
is Jerry Hahn and I'm the manager

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,839
corporate direct relations for the

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,088
serious organization so I have to rat

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,410
out mark a little bit mark and I started

6
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,990
working together last year when I came

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,550
into the symposium and I realized when I

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,389
saw him that he and I went to high

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,269
school together

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:28,039
so we graduate 1213 years ago so my

11
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:29,900
cat's I'll just just so you know so so I

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,689
did want to point that out you serve on

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,670
you but and secondly mark has been a

14
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,309
great friend and partner to Purdue and

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,340
serious as well and this evening at our

16
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,309
poster session and our reception for the

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,469
coast lab mark has brought at no

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,539
personal risk to himself one of the

19
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,690
Enigma machines so as anyone remember

20
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,550
the imitation game movie okay so it's in

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
the house we have one we're going to

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,919
have it on display in the in the

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,319
ballroom tonight during the reception it

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,629
is not a reproductions the real thing so

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,570
there will be armed guards around it so

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,640
be be wary but but we will have that to

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,610
show so it's something to see if you'd

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,860
like to come so next up on the schedule

29
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,360
we have linter woods and Lynn is the

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,970
executive director of the executive

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,210
Women's Forum and I do want to also

32
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,860
announce that during our women in

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,658
cybersecurity event last evening or

34
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,630
women and InfoSec we announced a

35
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,390
partnership between serious and the

36
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,130
executive limits forum so we are going

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,439
to be offering the scholarship this fall

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,750
in exchange and we are also going to be

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,720
a sponsor for their executive Women's

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,520
Forum annual conference so we're excited

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,408
to get this this ball rolling so to

42
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,259
spend a few minutes talking about the

43
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,869
executives forum and the recent survey

44
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,560
is linter woods okay thank you thanks so

45
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,030
much Jerry so I want to begin with why

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,840
do we care because I think that's very

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,170
important

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,969
so IFC squared which is an organization

49
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,369
that many of you may know has a

50
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,538
foundation called the Center for cyber

51
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:07,969
safety and education and they conduct a

52
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,920
biennial survey of information security

53
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,079
professionals and they've been doing

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,179
this now I think maybe they're on their

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,610
sixth or seventh survey in the past

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,370
three by enniaa if you want if you want

57
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,069
to say that

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,430
they've had a women in security a

59
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,380
separate sub study this year I was

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,090
privileged to be able to participate not

61
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,890
only in helping to develop the questions

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,300
but also to help write this report and

63
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,130
you know I think one of the reasons that

64
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,020
we care about this is those of you who

65
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,150
are here from industry know this and I

66
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,970
think many students do - we have a

67
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,890
severe labor shortage and this is

68
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,069
worldwide this isn't just in North

69
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,010
America and but it begets another bigger

70
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:53,700
problem and that is unless we have

71
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,530
diversity in our ranks and all levels we

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,299
cut off the innovation cycles what we do

73
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,070
we end up not being as clever and as

74
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,320
innovative as we will need to be in

75
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,380
order to face the problems that we need

76
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,730
to face down in the next you know 50

77
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,019
hundred years whatever that may be

78
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,988
because I don't think these things are

79
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,700
going away so as Jerry said I'm with the

80
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,550
executive Women's Forum which is a

81
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,380
member organization for women in cyber

82
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,180
we've been around for 15 years and I'll

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,100
tell you a little bit about this I think

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,920
at the end but at what I'd like to do is

85
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,500
to get into some of the findings of the

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,119
study I mean this is of all audiences

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,030
here I really appreciate it because I

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,360
know all of you value facts and data and

89
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,049
it helps us to to paint a picture here

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,680
that's based on facts and data so I'll

91
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:44,100
begin with some of the key takeaways

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,190
globally we represent about 11% of the

93
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,260
population women do in cybersecurity

94
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,680
so let me promote context around that if

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,340
you look at the International Labor

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,970
Statistics worldwide regardless of what

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,340
job you may hold women hold about 40% or

98
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,269
represent about 40% of the workforce in

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,640
IT it's around 20 to 25 percent so that

100
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,820
gives you an idea of that ever shrinking

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,200
pool so we're in a very rarefied area

102
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,600
here and you can see that in North

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,789
America we have a little bit of a better

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,738
or higher percentage than for example

105
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,560
Europe so that may have been a little

106
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:27,690
bit of a surprise to some of you here so

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,720
we're a small piece of the pie another

108
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,200
piece here that we found out is that

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,200
globally

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,090
men are four times more likely to be in

111
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,780
the c-suite and to be in an

112
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,179
executive-level position and nine times

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,969
more likely to be in a management role

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,400
now I know that many of you here are our

115
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,320
math geeks so you're like well duh of

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,799
course you start with a small slice of

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,330
the pie you cannot expect to see

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,880
representative numbers in the c-suite or

119
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,950
even at the managerial level okay so it

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,100
does make sense but it doesn't make

121
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,190
sense for us right because again if you

122
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,810
will look a little bit later on but what

123
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,850
we'll find is when we start talking

124
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:14,460
about we post questions around you know

125
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,260
bias in the workplace you'll see some

126
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,070
interesting statistics around that in a

127
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,840
moment now let's talk about education

128
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,300
which I know is near and dear to all of

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,789
you here fifty-one percent of women

130
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,180
versus forty-five percent of men hold

131
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,380
graduate degrees and today now this

132
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,640
doesn't include the Millennial

133
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,430
population okay

134
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,800
but today women in cyber who are not

135
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,600
Millennials come from much more diverse

136
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,420
educational backgrounds and I represent

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,140
that by the way because I left actually

138
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,320
I stopped writing a dissertation in the

139
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,099
Department of classics because we got a

140
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,469
grant a computing grant and it was the

141
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,850
early days of the internet and on campus

142
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,130
computing introduced me to this

143
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,990
wonderful thing and said that I could

144
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,750
talk to other colleagues around the

145
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,730
world using Pine and L on my UNIX shell

146
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,920
account so you know that was the

147
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,580
beginning of the end I actually had no

148
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,820
background whatsoever in in computing

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,599
and but I had an interest and a lot of

150
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,780
curiosity and as I talking to to you

151
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,460
here at lunch I started by putting

152
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:28,200
computers together and that that began

153
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:30,810
my multi-year learning curve so I am I

154
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:35,099
know anecdotally a number of women come

155
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,730
from maybe from finance HR audit places

156
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,460
like that departments that may have had

157
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,800
you know serious deficiencies and cyber

158
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,760
controls and things like that and that

159
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,490
was their entree

160
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,039
into cybersecurity so that's not an

161
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,750
uncommon thing but again when we talk

162
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,730
about diversity there's diversity of

163
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,340
thought as well as we know there are

164
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,560
many paths to the Buddha and so we need

165
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,909
to have a lot of different viewpoints to

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,100
solve the kinds of problems that we're

167
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,470
looking at and it involves people with

168
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,720
the traditional technical and science

169
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:13,110
degrees as well as those that have a

170
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:15,060
very different path to decipher so this

171
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,650
just gives you a breakdown you'll get

172
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,390
all of these slides here you can see

173
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,909
what the breakdown is still

174
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,640
predominantly computer and information

175
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,260
sciences Millennials though millennial

176
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,900
women by far are on track to have a

177
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:37,380
gender parity in the computer sciences

178
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:39,750
area which is great.i so this is not a

179
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,420
surprise we know this because every

180
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,710
study that's been done by is c-squared

181
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:49,110
has has had the same result every two

182
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,270
years but I will tell you that the

183
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,510
salary gap is starting to close at the

184
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,580
executive levels so this is I think a

185
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,860
solvable problem what we need to do is

186
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,690
whatever is driving that has to be

187
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,230
pushed downward to other levels as well

188
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,060
because you know parity and salary again

189
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,000
we're talking or having a fax and data

190
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,800
discussion those of you from from

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,870
companies know that most companies have

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,590
you know fairly detailed job

193
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,280
descriptions career ladders and pads as

194
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,489
well as salary ranges and there are we

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,289
have the ability within companies to to

196
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,490
even this out much more than than we

197
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,350
have today now this is this is the thing

198
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,140
that really kind of surprises we started

199
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:39,229
to ask questions in in last year's

200
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:42,240
survey around overall what we would call

201
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,760
organizational health how happy our

202
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,120
information security professionals in

203
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,310
the job in the job at the job okay so

204
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,460
what we found out because when we asked

205
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,770
them what have you experienced one or

206
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,350
more forms of discrimination and then we

207
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,810
delineated what those types of disk

208
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,840
nation might entail from unconscious

209
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:07,319
bias to outright you know delay in your

210
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,440
career or my opinion is not valued what

211
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,140
we found is we found that 51% of women

212
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,900
experienced one or more forms of

213
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,189
discrimination in the workplace and I

214
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:23,340
double checked this last night the 15

215
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:28,080
percent of men were predominantly men of

216
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,850
color okay so what that means is we've

217
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,790
got a lot of we have a lot of work

218
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,980
because if you are regardless of who you

219
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,439
are if you're in the workplace and you

220
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,630
feel that your opinion doesn't matter by

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,330
the way the number of women who answer

222
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,880
the survey who said that they felt their

223
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,970
opinion did not matter with almost one

224
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,980
and three just under one and three a

225
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,620
very significant number when we think

226
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,240
about the pipeline and we think about

227
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,120
how how we attract talent how we retain

228
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,580
that talent and we remain competitive

229
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,080
that's that's a problem and you also

230
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,670
even though the number is smaller I

231
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,380
don't think that 15 percent is

232
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,270
insignificant either so these are

233
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,570
problems that we need to face into and

234
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,579
to address fairly soberly and if you can

235
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,980
tell I can't tell you all the reasons

236
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,220
why there's more research that needs to

237
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,260
be done and we're going to work on that

238
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,230
but you know this is beginning to you

239
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,760
know I think help us to at least lift up

240
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,570
the rug and look underneath and see

241
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,930
what's there and this just goes into the

242
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,730
different types of forms of

243
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,959
discrimination that we talked about you

244
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,240
know unexplained denial or delay in your

245
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,460
advancement unconscious discrimination

246
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,090
exaggerated highlighting of mistakes and

247
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,220
errors and so on we worked with with a

248
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,170
number of organizations when we put the

249
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,210
questions together and I was very very

250
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,360
happy because we had some very spirited

251
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:00,900
debates of what that list would include

252
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:05,910
and then you can see this is very

253
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:08,520
interesting to me women who are more

254
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,500
advanced in their career report higher

255
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,329
level of instances of discrimination

256
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,250
I have a personal theory about that it's

257
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,760
not one that I can say we have facts and

258
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,580
data around but I I wonder where where

259
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,920
we are in terms of when you get into the

260
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,530
workforce and you're fairly new how many

261
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,270
of us are truly aware of company culture

262
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:33,819
of business how things work I think that

263
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,620
takes some time and I think once we get

264
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,140
oriented to that it would be interesting

265
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,390
to know - for the men whether or not

266
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,250
that is also you know even though it's a

267
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,069
different ratio proportion where they're

268
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,170
not a similar experience because some of

269
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,000
these issues is you know you know I'm

270
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,920
talking to you about you know women in

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,470
cybersecurity but some of these issues

272
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,630
that we face really are not gender

273
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:02,290
specific necessarily we solve a lot of

274
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:04,270
problems now this is this is a little

275
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,490
bit of a duh but I think that it's very

276
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,890
important because when we start to have

277
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,170
the conversation you know when we

278
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,880
understand why it's important then you

279
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,310
start asking the question so what do we

280
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,900
do about this women in the workforce and

281
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,089
men - who have had leadership

282
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:28,540
development who have had a mentor who

283
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,570
have had a sponsor all of them not

284
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,360
surprisingly feel happier at work they

285
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,740
feel more content in their job and

286
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,740
what's not what you don't see here on

287
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,320
this graph is that they tend to have

288
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,040
been into their job for a longer period

289
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,930
of time and is anyone here who is a you

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,140
know with a company when you're putting

291
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,420
together a cybersecurity team you know

292
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,819
you want it you want diversity on the

293
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,860
team but it really helps to four to have

294
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,080
a team with organizational understanding

295
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,760
what your business does how your company

296
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,770
works all of those things and that

297
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,770
institutional knowledge is it gained in

298
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,530
the first 4 to 1 or 2 years on the job

299
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,900
so having someone in place and having

300
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,250
some longevity at the company not

301
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:18,069
necessarily in the role is important and

302
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:22,500
so you can see here that generally

303
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:24,819
people who feel valued they have had

304
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,759
opportunities for leader

305
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:30,039
development coaching mentoring and and

306
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,350
including going to conferences and

307
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:37,389
getting training so very important and

308
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,129
so it's sponsorship by the way I think

309
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:40,479
what talked a little bit about this

310
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:42,579
earlier maybe was yes

311
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
it was yesterday our last evening a

312
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,149
sponsor is someone that's beyond the

313
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,759
mentor that person is actually going to

314
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,559
tell you whether or not there's a new

315
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,449
opening at the company or an opportunity

316
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,879
for advancement they're going to

317
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:56,709
recommend you for a stretch assignment

318
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,529
things like that so a sponsorship is a

319
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,419
much more proactive thing a mentor can

320
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:04,689
eventually become a sponsor because they

321
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,850
see in you the the potential and want to

322
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,589
open up more opportunities and so we

323
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,899
wanted to make that distinction in the

324
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:14,499
survey this year as well

325
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:16,929
I would also this is a crowd that you'll

326
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:20,169
appreciate this we almost doubled the

327
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:23,049
number of respondents from this year as

328
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:25,089
opposed to two years ago and so that's

329
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,910
another thing that made made me very

330
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,369
happy because you know statistically

331
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,069
when you start you know looking at a

332
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,929
conclusion you want to have the data to

333
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:37,509
back that up and you certainly want them

334
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:39,009
you know the more the more people that

335
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,519
respond to the survey the better your

336
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:44,499
data set and some of these things to I'm

337
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,869
not going into it here but also have

338
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:50,409
historical value not the new questions

339
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:52,569
but salary certainly and the number of

340
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:54,669
women that hold managerial positions

341
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:56,049
that is a question that's been asked

342
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,059
since the beginning of the survey so we

343
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,809
have historical data on that as well

344
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,759
I know that we're a little bit behind so

345
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:06,988
I don't want to what I'd like to do is

346
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,819
just very quickly tell you that

347
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:12,639
recommendations that were making you

348
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:14,769
know I think my first recommendation is

349
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,009
some of these areas we need to now get

350
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,199
beyond the survey questions and get to

351
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:23,019
deeper research but we really want to

352
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,059
tell companies that just like the other

353
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,729
things that you do in business to have

354
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:31,209
performance indicators to be able to

355
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:33,730
look at how you recruit who's on the

356
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:37,059
interview loop things like that are very

357
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,590
very important and to have goals actual

358
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:42,240
goals that are you know

359
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:46,120
look at whether or not you are truly

360
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,400
have a diverse team are enforcing you

361
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,290
know some type of gender parity in your

362
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,780
in your organization you know the other

363
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,510
piece too is if your company doesn't

364
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,720
have a leadership development mentoring

365
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,420
or some type of sponsorship or other

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,940
types of opportunities there are other

367
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,890
organizations that you can leverage not

368
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,340
every company is a multi-billion dollar

369
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,750
you know multinational corporation there

370
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,240
are many companies out there that are

371
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,340
much smaller where you know it's it's

372
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,590
this isn't possible to you know to

373
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,330
institute these kinds of programs but

374
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,980
there are other organizations out there

375
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,410
We certainly have those programs and

376
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,020
there are other organizations that have

377
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,790
these types of programs as well and I

378
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,500
think this is important to is just to be

379
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,569
able to take a sober look inside your

380
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,640
organization and sake you know how are

381
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,960
we doing what are we doing you know I

382
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,880
think one of the nice things about

383
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,800
working with Purdue is that you have a

384
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,740
history actually of supporting women and

385
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,500
it's a it's an individual that along the

386
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,560
way made a conscious decision that said

387
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,860
we will do this it's important you know

388
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,359
I don't I don't think that it's any more

389
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,150
honestly dramatic than that but that

390
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,850
that begins a culture and what happens

391
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:05,410
is you know you have success and success

392
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,880
breeds more success and obviously pay

393
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,370
inequity I talked a little bit about

394
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,710
this earlier on I I know having worked

395
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,399
for very large companies over the past

396
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:18,130
20 years that you know HR departments as

397
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,340
well as hiring managers all of us have

398
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,440
you know this is a solvable thing we

399
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,849
need to look at it in a way that makes

400
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,920
sense I know that one of the biggest

401
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,849
challenges for corporations is how do we

402
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,740
not rock the boat

403
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,389
how do we not disenfranchise other

404
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,340
people while we're trying to make a

405
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,300
program like this happen I get it I

406
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,610
totally get it

407
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:42,520
but doing nothing is obviously not

408
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:44,800
working and you know clearly we really

409
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,210
really want to encourage especially

410
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:53,100
young women into stem programs even with

411
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,960
a classics degree you know I have

412
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,120
truly upon leaving the university I

413
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,950
talked to the mathematics department and

414
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,870
asked them whether or not I just

415
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,270
shouldn't start a program with with them

416
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,559
you know giving you know given my

417
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:11,260
interest and just begin at the beginning

418
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:14,230
even as a not as a as a graduate student

419
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,960
but as an undergrad and they were very

420
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,510
open and very very willing to entertain

421
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,240
that it is important there's a lot of

422
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,900
things that we look at in our field that

423
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,980
require I guess the curiosity and the

424
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:33,309
passion for things that are technical

425
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,830
and are scientific and mathematical the

426
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:40,658
the other piece here too is that in

427
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:42,970
business though especially as we want

428
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,130
more women in the c-suite it's important

429
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,890
that it's not just a technology problem

430
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,289
and it's not the only conversation you

431
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,090
you can hold so we have to have a better

432
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:56,559
I think understanding of the business

433
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,780
overall and what that requires to is a I

434
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,049
think you know diversity not only in

435
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,908
your and your your background but also

436
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:08,350
being open to other disciplines and

437
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:11,020
appreciating them so what I'd like to do

438
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,820
is talk about the executive Women's

439
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,049
Forum we've been doing this for 15 years

440
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,710
we have a mentoring program called lift

441
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:23,470
leadership journey is our leadership

442
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,419
development program we do other things

443
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,220
as well we have a scholarship program

444
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,380
and now we have a scholarship program

445
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,120
with Purdue but we're very proud of

446
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,059
because it is important to seed that

447
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,760
pipeline but we also we have a group

448
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,860
that we look at Millennials and

449
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,600
understand what their needs are because

450
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,939
that's like earlier usually there

451
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,260
earlier on in the career lifecycle we

452
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,919
also have a diversity inclusion

453
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,289
initiative because as I said earlier

454
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:53,260
this is this issue cuts across a lot of

455
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:55,900
different ways and overall we need to

456
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,760
diversify the ranks the voice privacy

457
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,090
Alliance I have a personal passion for

458
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,340
for voice-enabled IOT and to provide

459
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,699
back to industry to give back to

460
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,500
industry tools and thought leadership

461
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,080
around what it is that we're going to do

462
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,030
in this space and then of course with

463
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,460
kids we do the cybersecurity school

464
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,889
challenge and we draw we don't create

465
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,660
our own curriculum we draw from like is

466
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:25,750
C squared and other organizations so I

467
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,970
encourage ladies I encourage you to

468
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,210
become a member we have a national

469
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,960
conference we also have a upcoming event

470
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:38,130
in May called cyber women on the hill

471
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,110
and public/private partnership it is a

472
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,310
it's a first time for us it'll be very

473
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,500
interesting we thought we were just

474
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:47,530
going to hold a regional event and we

475
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,590
were invited to Capitol Hill that's how

476
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,360
important this is and everyone that

477
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,659
we're talking to regardless of political

478
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,080
affiliation will agree that there's a

479
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:03,370
tremendous labor shortage and we need to

480
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:08,189
diversify the ranks why don't I just

481
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:10,449
pause there and entertain some questions

482
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,290
questions comments out first

483
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:18,730
no no emotional outbursts no cries of

484
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:20,360
what do you think it's post-lunch great

485
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:26,130
Thank You Lin thank you

486
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,129
[Applause]

487
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,120
you
