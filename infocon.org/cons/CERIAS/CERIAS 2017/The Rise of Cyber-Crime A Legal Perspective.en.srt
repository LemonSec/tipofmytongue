thank you thank you for having me here

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,830
like Jerry said I my background before

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,390
becoming a lawyer was an IT so I have

20
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,070
some experience there as a computer

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,400
program raised to do web based

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,770
programming and PHP MySQL all that sort

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,239
of gets stuff back in the day but here

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,620
I'm not going to talk to you too much

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,360
about tech stuff I'm going to talk to

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,819
you more about the kind of legal

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,229
perspective of cybercrime and so I

28
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,579
thought I'd do I'll try to make this

29
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,009
interactive too and if you have

30
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,928
questions feel free to ask them as I'm

31
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,490
talking but here are really the topics I

32
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:16,719
want to cover just an overview of the

33
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,399
cyber crime that I see in my practice

34
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,889
the kind of the top threats we see and

35
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,509
then you know data breach you hear a lot

36
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:25,009
about that i thought it's always good

37
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,450
sometimes when we're on the phone with a

38
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,649
client when they've had a data breach

39
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,420
and we're talking to a company ahead of

40
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,100
time they wonder you know what is it

41
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,659
exactly that the lawyers do for data

42
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,449
breeks they know what computer forensics

43
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,789
firm does the PR firm you know what law

44
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,770
enforcement does usually but they really

45
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,329
wonder what is outside councils role in

46
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,219
that so I'll kind of take you through

47
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,740
what what I do and what law firms do

48
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:49,038
related to data breach and then I

49
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,020
thought we talked about you know how the

50
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:53,659
the data breaches in different cyber

51
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,130
crimes play out in a courtroom and then

52
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,270
feel free to ask questions about that

53
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,789
because I think that's one of those

54
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,249
forgotten aspects of these things and

55
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:03,139
will kind of maybe explain a little bit

56
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,029
more about what a lawyer's role is in a

57
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:06,649
data breach and I you know when those

58
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:11,319
things happen i'm working with the the

59
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:16,280
IT people as well so the top threats

60
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,560
we're seeing here we go it's a in cyber

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,430
crime are fun transfer fraud so a lot of

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,049
what you see in the new

63
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,849
is about data breaches you know lost

64
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,430
Social Security numbers or credit card

65
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,260
numbers we see a lot of attacks for

66
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,120
companies stealing money so getting

67
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,340
tricking people into wiring money out of

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,569
a company those types of things

69
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,280
ransomware which I'm sure you've heard

70
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,409
about in the news or made you know have

71
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,200
experience with I'll show you kind of

72
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:41,120
examples of those malicious insiders

73
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,219
these are the typical scenarios some

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,500
employee on this last day or the week

75
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,060
before he leaves the company bloods that

76
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,980
a thumb drive tries to take a bunch of

77
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,799
company documents or tries to actively

78
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,720
sabotage this company w to phishing

79
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:55,099
scams that around tax season is very

80
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,019
prevalent in the beginning of the year

81
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,328
I'll show you some examples of those I

82
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,739
know there's been some kind of attacks

83
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,060
that have gotten some press in Indiana

84
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,709
and then we'll talk about data breaches

85
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,689
fund transfer fraud like I said this is

86
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,569
basically the attack cyber attacker

87
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,219
trying to either steal money out from a

88
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,189
company or trick someone in the company

89
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,290
to wiring money to them the most you

90
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:21,168
know and this has been a huge huge issue

91
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,599
for for companies the FBI their last

92
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,280
statistics reported over 1.2 billion

93
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,409
dollars in losses reported a law

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,419
enforcement alone I would imagine the

95
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:31,250
number is much higher because a lot of

96
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:34,669
these companies don't report these law

97
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,909
enforcement so what is one of these

98
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:39,919
attacks look like typically it's an

99
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,108
email like this I don't know if you can

100
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,239
see see you right here but it's

101
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,889
typically an email that spoofs an email

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,780
coming from some executives so when you

103
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,180
trust whose higher up in the company and

104
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,939
this one this example it's going to the

105
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,129
CFO is asking them to process an outside

106
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:57,650
wire transfer so this is an example we

107
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,298
see a lot of there's variations on these

108
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,519
the hackers they are very good at these

109
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,079
they will watch social media they will

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,209
see you know if they know the CEO is

111
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,400
traveling they'll say hey we just closed

112
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,680
the deal in Hong Kong please wire money

113
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,909
to this bank and we see them be sneaky

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,709
about it too they'll put in things like

115
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,418
this is a very confidential company

116
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,970
transaction please do not discuss with

117
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,530
anyone else and so it always say very

118
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,359
important you know this needs to be done

119
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,918
now I think they kind of get people's

120
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,120
emotions to where they're they're just

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,620
doing something you're not thinking

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,539
about it and they they end up wiring

123
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,889
money outside of their companies the

124
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,200
other thing we see a lot of times with

125
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:32,360
these is these examples go into a CFO

126
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,080
but you know it's easy for them to find

127
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,789
you know

128
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,378
people through LinkedIn and social media

129
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:38,330
who works and who's in what roles

130
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,909
companies a lot of times they want to

131
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,560
hit like a mid-level person they'll damn

132
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:45,050
drop they'll say hey already talked to

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,669
Jan and finance this is fine you know

134
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,800
sort of thing and they'll drop in

135
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,688
details and sometimes they are actually

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,419
in the company's email system so they

137
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:56,240
have read emails from the CEO they know

138
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:58,219
how he sends emails when he does wire

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,469
transfer requests so they will look even

140
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:04,639
more legitimate so this is a common type

141
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:10,789
of attack we see for against our clients

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:13,789
and others so how does this play out in

143
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:15,969
a courtroom well you have basically

144
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:19,280
what's called the UCC it's the universe

145
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:21,259
uniform commercial code and the default

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,500
actually in these types of incidents is

147
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,360
the liability falls to the default

148
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,159
liability is for the liability to fall

149
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,289
to the bank but there's a huge exception

150
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,449
there that basically swallows the rule

151
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,490
which says the liability falls to the

152
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,689
customer if the bank is adopted a

153
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,879
commercially reasonable security

154
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:40,219
procedure and follow that procedure in

155
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,719
good faith now what is commercially

156
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:44,270
reasonable mean they're not a lot of

157
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:46,159
cases on these the courts will generally

158
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,419
the industry standards so you know they

159
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,060
may say is it commercially reasonable

160
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,948
for the bank to have a system where it

161
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,830
only takes one person to authorize a

162
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:57,289
wire transfer so that's what comes up in

163
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,878
these types of disputes you know is it

164
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,650
commercially reasonable for the bank to

165
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,199
only require a username and a password

166
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,520
or is commercially reasonable this

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,500
really mean they should have

168
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,330
multi-factor authentication or they

169
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,219
should have two people confirm or voice

170
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,690
controls so you get all of these types

171
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:14,120
of issues when you have one of these

172
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,639
situations come up where money gets

173
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,259
wired out of companies and then

174
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
obviously there's the factual question

175
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,520
of did the bank follow the security

176
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,289
procedure there's a lot of nuances these

177
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,060
cases they're very interesting from

178
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,460
legal perspective you know some of the

179
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,349
arguments the bank might make are we are

180
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,969
we offered these additional security

181
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,710
procedures to the customer and they

182
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:36,830
decline them you know we had a procedure

183
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,900
that says 44 and wire transfers we're

184
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,359
going to require you to XY and Z but you

185
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,250
did not you know you know take us up and

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,110
you know take us up on that offer to use

187
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,849
that security procedure so those things

188
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,649
all come into play when there's litig

189
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:56,719
a shin or disputes over these fund

190
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:58,249
transfers this one so next is ransomware

191
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:00,409
you probably see a lot of this in the

192
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:02,869
news this is just a quick example of a

193
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,699
ransomware attack it's similar to ones

194
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:07,189
we've seen on our clients where you get

195
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,009
an email it's not unusual for an HR

196
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,659
person to give me an email that says see

197
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,189
my resume attached you know that's an

198
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,959
email that they may open on a daily

199
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,059
basis especially if they have a position

200
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,529
open and the cyber attackers can see

201
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:20,599
those positions and they can tailor the

202
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,179
email and say hey I'm applying for this

203
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,279
and then the person opens the attachment

204
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:27,619
sometimes it's they click a link within

205
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,199
the attachment and then they get a

206
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:32,539
ransomware screen ransomware then runs

207
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,759
and it this happens a matter of seconds

208
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,649
less than a minute they can encrypt all

209
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,689
of the files on your computer the files

210
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,240
are still there they just encrypted so

211
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,919
you can't use them the ransomware this

212
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,529
is an old old variant of ransomware

213
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,419
cryptolocker the newer ransomware does

214
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,279
things like not only encrypt the files

215
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,169
on your computer it encrypts the files

216
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,329
on every network drive your computer has

217
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,609
access to even if that computer is not

218
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:57,469
mapped to the network drive so these can

219
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,939
really cripple a company as when

220
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,159
companies find out if their backups

221
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,959
really work they find out how quickly

222
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,229
they can set up a Bitcoin account and

223
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:09,979
pay the the attackers the there's a

224
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,628
local FBI offices here in Indiana and so

225
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,550
a lot of times you work with the lawyers

226
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,439
get involved in working with the FBI and

227
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,729
helping the clients make the decision on

228
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,499
whether they're going to pay the ransom

229
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:23,449
or not malicious insiders we talked

230
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:25,279
about these are examples from the law

231
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,550
enforcement community of malicious

232
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,349
insiders I sure everyone recognizes a

233
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,688
Snowden and there's a there's Aldrich

234
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,578
Ames and robert hansen as well just kind

235
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:36,438
of some examples of some malicious

236
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:39,228
insiders from a legal perspective

237
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:41,348
lawyers worry about this too and we

238
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,819
worry about it there's a couple examples

239
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:46,399
not to pick on IT people but here

240
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:48,529
examples recently of law firms whose IT

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
people caused them to have you know

242
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,389
committed cybercrime at one was a a

243
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,410
large law firm where their IT person was

244
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:56,149
you know lawyers get a lot of

245
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,380
confidential information about their

246
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,710
clients so you know we know about

247
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,990
mergers or acquisitions things like that

248
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,270
before they happen and so this employee

249
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,220
was was using that information who is

250
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,829
not a lawyer's an IT person to do

251
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,990
insider trading or there was an IT

252
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,400
engineer who was actually sentenced to

253
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,560
nine and a half years in jail for a

254
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,449
network attack on his law firm after he

255
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,530
left so you know these are examples for

256
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,050
lawyers but it's something you know

257
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,300
every company has to be aware of you

258
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,459
know you know that auditing and

259
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,530
separation of controls between the IT

260
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,510
people and making sure they're not the

261
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,650
ones who are also in charge of watching

262
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,960
themselves another one we see like I

263
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,110
talked about is this w to phishing scam

264
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,820
this is a is a big one during this time

265
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,100
of year this is an example based on you

266
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,160
know a lot of actual attacks last year

267
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,500
we probably helped a dozen or so clients

268
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,839
deal with this w to phishing scam attack

269
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,750
this is a very very common attack the

270
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,640
IRS has put out alerts about this but

271
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,250
it's very simple it's a lot like the

272
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,900
fund transfer fraud attack except it's

273
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,690
directed to new people so the accounts

274
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,370
payable the people hender handle wire

275
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,170
transfer they've gotten used to seeing

276
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,030
to be spoof of packs they see them a lot

277
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,410
the HR people they're not used to

278
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,510
getting targeted as much they get

279
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,250
targeted now through ransomware and do

280
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,260
this w to phishing scheme where it's

281
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,310
just a request from what looks like the

282
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:21,020
CEO to send w-2s for a view and this is

283
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,510
a fact that a lot of people fall for

284
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,920
because you know they're doing what

285
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,630
their boss has asked them to do is what

286
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,400
they think and they're not checking the

287
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:33,580
email headers to see if they're spoofed

288
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:37,400
those types of things then data breach

289
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,320
you know that that is a huge topic all

290
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,900
of its own but I thought what we'd focus

291
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,930
on Israel what do lawyers do during a

292
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,120
data breach so one task we do is assist

293
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,339
with the execution of a breach response

294
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,350
plan so the company has an incident

295
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,870
response plan we help them kind of

296
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,700
almost like the coach and coordinating

297
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,590
all the different elements when you have

298
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,720
a data breach that could mean working

299
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,960
with a PR team working with law

300
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,030
enforcement working with computer

301
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,770
forensics people who are doing you know

302
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,420
people who are trying to figure out what

303
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,130
happened and people are trying to stop

304
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,140
and fix the breach so there could be a

305
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,060
lot of moving parts and you know part of

306
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,630
the lawyers job is just making sure

307
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,760
everything

308
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,800
is happening making sure that what's

309
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,980
needing to take place is going on and

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,620
whip that identifying legal obligations

311
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,710
that the company may have so one is I

312
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,940
want to make clear and what we talked to

313
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,620
with companies a lot of times we get a

314
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,240
call from climate says hey I've had a

315
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,730
data breach and i like to say at the

316
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,650
outset you don't know that yet you may

317
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,420
have had a security incident but data

318
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,640
breach is a legally defined term and

319
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,770
that definition is different in almost

320
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,260
every state that has a data breach

321
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,300
notification loss all there are 47

322
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,740
different state laws on what counts to

323
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,569
do it's a data breach there are some

324
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,030
similarities between them there are some

325
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,180
differences in some states losing a

326
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,339
username and a password in and of itself

327
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,170
to an online account counts as a data

328
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,780
breach that requires notice in some

329
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,130
states a username and password to an

330
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,350
account that has financial information

331
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,210
is what counts the data breach and some

332
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,740
states it's only social security numbers

333
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,630
credit card numbers financial account

334
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,160
numbers the whole username and password

335
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,620
thing is no part of their data breach

336
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,510
tax cheats so there's really a legal

337
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,190
determination that has to be made of you

338
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,290
no one did the company have a data

339
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,770
breach and then to what are their legal

340
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,110
obligations in connection with that and

341
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,090
those become something that's that has

342
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,250
to be very important decisions to be

343
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,200
made at the outset and unfortunately has

344
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,670
to be made pretty quickly as well while

345
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,380
you're gathering information while

346
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,380
computer forensics being done go ahead

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,540
that's exactly right we've had some

348
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,160
clients who I would advise doing this

349
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,319
because it makes it a lot smoother who

350
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,910
actually have a project manager who

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,980
works through with them on their

352
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,079
incident response team but a lot of

353
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,310
times we end up doing in addition the

354
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,779
legal work kind of the project

355
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,250
management work because there are there

356
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,020
are a lot of different things going on

357
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,820
when a data breach occurs you know if

358
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,709
you're working with PR firm and what

359
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,480
statement do we put out two employees

360
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,089
what statements do we put out to

361
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,860
possibly affected people and we'll talk

362
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,950
about how important those statements are

363
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,740
when we talk about the litigation so the

364
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,300
company is fortunate to have a cisco do

365
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,350
they normally pick up that ball to kind

366
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,569
of know there's a there's an interesting

367
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,950
dynamic that happens when there's a data

368
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,279
breach and the company has a sistah

369
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,860
because on one hand i really think

370
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,890
there's a human element too I've allowed

371
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,540
this to happen so that person a lot of

372
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,360
times it's really focused on figuring

373
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,079
out what happened in fixing it and they

374
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,000
are not worried about talking to the FBI

375
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,739
what the PR message is going to be so

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,450
usually they are not the ones who are

377
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,910
kind of coordinating the whole response

378
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,700
plan you know calls with the board a lot

379
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,319
of times we try to keep the siso focused

380
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,640
on what they are doing and fixing the

381
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,440
problem because they are getting

382
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,029
non-stop questions over and over you

383
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,860
know the board members want to ask them

384
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,170
what's happened if it's you know a large

385
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,390
company the CEO wants to ask people keep

386
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,439
wanting to ask you know is it fixed yet

387
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,240
what happened and so I know my colleague

388
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,040
the co-chair of my practice he used to

389
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,600
run information security for a company

390
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,770
and he would say when they have an

391
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,720
incident like that they actually had

392
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,670
someone assigned to deflect all the

393
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,079
questions from the system because they

394
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,790
just get inundated with you know

395
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,829
everyone wanting to know what's going on

396
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,000
so they usually don't end up being the

397
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:38,829
person who runs the the response team

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,560
but good questions and feel free anyone

399
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:43,510
to jump in another important aspect

400
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,550
which my colleague Nick ruse I think

401
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,709
talked about when he spoke at this this

402
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,750
series was about potential insurance

403
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,479
coverage so a company may have insurance

404
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,699
coverage that provides support for the

405
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,079
data breach they may be at the same time

406
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,209
having to argue with their insurance

407
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,309
cover e

408
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,469
over you know whether there's coverage

409
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:03,089
for the breach who's the council they're

410
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,129
going to select and who's the forensics

411
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,959
vendor or PR vendor they're going to use

412
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,910
and those are tasks that are typically

413
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,888
done by the the attorneys to handle you

414
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,618
don't want your your sis o or your your

415
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,149
tech people or sometimes even the client

416
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:19,619
themselves to have to worry about doing

417
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,449
that in the midst of a data breach the

418
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,790
scope of the breach and we'll talk about

419
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,949
the the case is coming up and how

420
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,230
important this is but it's important not

421
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,910
to just identify what it is going to

422
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,920
breach it's important to know you know

423
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,529
as quickly as you can who's been

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,089
affected what type of data was effect

425
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,100
you know is it just social security

426
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,139
numbers is it driver's license numbers

427
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,990
you know it's a credit card numbers what

428
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,899
type of information has been compromised

429
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,670
in some states loss of Social Security

430
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,889
numbers without the first David last

431
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,449
name to them isn't a data breach so you

432
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:54,389
know there's these things aren't just

433
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:56,309
intuitive and another comment on the

434
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:58,170
state laws which I probably should have

435
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:00,420
gone a little more detail on the state

436
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,689
law that applies the the state attorney

437
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,029
general's contend is the state of the

438
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:08,730
resident whose data was lost or affected

439
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,709
so even if you're an Indiana company if

440
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,079
you have customers who live in any other

441
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:15,029
state you have to look at to what those

442
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,888
laws are for those customers in their

443
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:19,679
respective states so you know if you

444
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,149
have your a convenience store and you

445
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,249
have customers who come in through

446
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,649
probably every state in the US and

447
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:27,569
there's some loss or some data breach

448
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,699
you have to look to what every one of

449
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,949
those state laws are for what your legal

450
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,410
obligations may be so it becomes this

451
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:37,019
this large task I have a binder in my

452
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,610
desk of all the 47 laws and I know that

453
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,519
you know pretty well from from dealing

454
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,980
with breaches so often but still these

455
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,360
laws change and every around july there

456
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,549
are a lot of updates a lot of states

457
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,829
have new laws then so you know it

458
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:52,350
becomes quite a task when there's a

459
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:55,799
large data breach of just identifying

460
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,509
the company's legal obligations in the

461
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,220
scope of the breach you also have

462
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,379
contractual obligations so for instance

463
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,439
if you're hosting another company's data

464
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,839
or if you do business with a government

465
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,900
entity they may impose on on you

466
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,359
obligations to report data breaches in a

467
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,280
to the ones that are in statutes of laws

468
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:19,260
and those can have really short time

469
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,000
frames as well the forensic

470
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,859
investigation that becomes a very

471
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,810
important part of this as well so it's a

472
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,729
lawyers get involved here in a lot of

473
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,500
areas to kind of protect the privilege

474
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,690
in the work product things that are

475
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,520
going on from potential litigation down

476
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,010
the road which means you know if you

477
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,570
hire a forensic consultant to come in

478
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,870
and look at the data breach and they say

479
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,520
you didn't have XY and z security

480
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,110
procedures you may not want that

481
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,650
document produced later if there's

482
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,389
customers suing you in litigation if the

483
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,130
attorney is directing that work if the

484
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,870
attorney is leading that work you have

485
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,570
an argument that that report from the

486
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,489
forensic examiners work product or as

487
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,139
attorney-client privilege and doesn't

488
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,740
have to be produced in litigation down

489
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,390
the road and there's law enforcement

490
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,180
becomes a part of this I can I can tell

491
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,070
you that I'm early on when we did a lot

492
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,660
of these cases clients one asks you know

493
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,850
what's the chance that they actually

494
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,230
catch the person i can tell you we've

495
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,659
had at least two where they've actually

496
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,280
got the person responsible for these

497
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,320
cyber crimes and they've led to some

498
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,210
federal indictments so it doesn't happen

499
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,720
very often especially if the person is

500
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,790
overseas but the FBI and law enforcement

501
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,370
agencies they are getting very savvy on

502
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,870
these and they encourage companies to be

503
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,489
very cooperative with these and

504
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,860
especially if you you see these people

505
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,150
replicate the same types of attacks so

506
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,610
if they do it to another company in

507
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,930
another company it's I forget the name

508
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,510
of the theory or criminological

509
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,040
principle but every time you do the same

510
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,660
crime you're more likely to get caught

511
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,830
you always leave something behind that

512
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,830
is a clue

513
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,779
powers

514
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,800
yeah good questions yeah and the

515
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,870
question was a what happens when the

516
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,610
attacker is overseas what power does law

517
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,409
enforcement have and it depends on the

518
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,570
country so if we have treaties or

519
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,190
agreements with the country then they

520
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,899
may cooperate with us there are some

521
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,940
countries and it depends on the time you

522
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,620
know it depends I don't know if you

523
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,200
follow the news sometimes you'll see

524
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,370
shortly after some you know meeting with

525
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,170
the president in the head of some

526
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,090
country they round up some cyber

527
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,400
attackers and some people get flipped

528
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,230
over to the US who the us Maino have

529
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,930
committed crimes and they've been in the

530
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,210
US and they've not been extradited the

531
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,040
FBI and law enforcement gets extremely

532
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,510
creative with these they have ways of

533
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,840
going after the people I would say it's

534
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,850
definitely less likely for them to bring

535
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,770
in and actually arrest someone in a

536
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,540
foreign country but it does happen and

537
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,560
they have cooperations with the law

538
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:00,320
enforcement agencies in other countries

539
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:03,020
is it too early to see if there's a

540
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,169
trend about more cooperation less

541
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,750
cooperation or none at all or nothing's

542
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,890
changing or a little more times required

543
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,950
to go well with the current

544
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,600
administration internationally Oh

545
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,850
internationally I think they're

546
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,040
definitely some trends you can you can

547
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,189
see like if you read news articles about

548
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,930
when these people get get brought to the

549
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,290
US get extradited you can sell which

550
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,610
countries are cooperating with the US

551
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,110
and sometimes they actually make

552
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,419
announcements about that you'll see

553
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,340
you're like President Obama or you know

554
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,510
someone from the State Department meet

555
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,220
with the head of state of another

556
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,680
country and they'll make an announcement

557
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,720
saying we've agreed to cooperate you

558
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,460
know on these types of things so I think

559
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,710
you can generally just watch the news

560
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,210
and follow and see what countries a lot

561
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,890
of times it's based on what countries

562
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,380
have better relationships with the

563
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:56,090
United States and which ones don't we've

564
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,490
talked about these notifications there's

565
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,220
the 47 or so different state

566
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,080
notification laws that come into play so

567
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,140
that's a lot of the part that lawyers

568
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,179
play when there's data breach so what I

569
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,040
find the more interesting thing is it's

570
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,540
really easy to just come in and say

571
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,090
there's been a data breach let's send

572
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,830
out some notification letters but the

573
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,490
lawyers job is more than that and i want

574
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,600
to show

575
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,910
how are how kind of the decisions made

576
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,800
when responding to a data breach play

577
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,330
out in litigation and so there's

578
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,730
different types of litigation that may

579
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,379
occur from a data breach one is your

580
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,670
consumer class action those are the ones

581
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,890
you probably hear about they get the

582
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,620
most press that's where the actual

583
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,330
customers whose information has been

584
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,919
allegedly compromised file a lawsuit

585
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,990
against the company on behalf of

586
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,000
themselves and other individuals and say

587
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,030
you know you owe me money because this

588
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,730
data breach happened there can also be

589
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,040
shareholder lawsuits now when I hear SDC

590
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,360
I'm from Florida I think of this sec but

591
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,790
is actually the Securities and Exchange

592
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,800
Commission that has set some guidance

593
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,950
for publicly traded companies so they

594
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,020
said back in 2011 they issued a guidance

595
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,450
regarding publicly traded companies

596
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,450
disclosure obligations related to cyber

597
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,130
security risk and cyber incidents and so

598
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,809
what this means is if you are a

599
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,240
shareholder a publicly traded company

600
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,730
and that company has a data breach and

601
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,350
it's had known about this breach and

602
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,750
maybe it's done about this breach for a

603
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,189
year or two years and it just comes out

604
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,140
in the press and now all of a sudden

605
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,520
your stock price has gone down you can

606
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,230
probably find a plaintiff's attorney

607
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,090
who'd be willing to sue that company and

608
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,730
say they've committed some sort of you

609
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,260
know securities violations or violations

610
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,870
that would entitle you as a shareholder

611
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,429
of the company to be compensated that's

612
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,719
another type of litigation you see

613
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,700
against companies from data breaches

614
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,990
even if you weren't the person whose

615
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,630
data was lost we see also individual

616
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,640
lawsuits this is a jury verdict form

617
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,980
from an actual case in Indiana this was

618
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,830
in Marion County where the plaintiff

619
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,340
sued a Walgreens pharmacy over the

620
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,809
pharmacists alleged disclosure of her

621
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,820
longer a legend at this point disclosure

622
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:05,030
of her information and you see the jury

623
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,490
awarded 1.8 million dollars and found

624
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,860
walgreens eighty percent at fault so I'd

625
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,900
forget doing the math how much they had

626
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,209
you know their verdict was but this was

627
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,240
upheld by the Indiana courts of Appeal

628
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:22,730
so we see also individual lawsuits based

629
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,679
on data breaches or loss of data there's

630
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,960
also regulatory actions so in addition

631
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,090
to you know some shareholders bringing a

632
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,440
lawsuit against you for things related

633
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,549
to publicly traded companies

634
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,860
you have the Securities and Exchange

635
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:36,139
Commission the Federal Trade Commission

636
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,879
FCC and department of health and human

637
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:40,279
services which all have the ability to

638
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:44,178
come in and take administrative actions

639
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,100
and possibly fine or enter into a good

640
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:50,509
read orders with companies who have had

641
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,668
security breaches and then the last one

642
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:54,230
which i think is becoming more common is

643
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,899
you have these business versus business

644
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,490
lawsuits a good example of that would be

645
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,229
a data breach where credit card

646
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,940
information is lost let's say your

647
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:06,230
company has had a massive data breach

648
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,299
and 100,000 credit cards were lost the

649
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,159
credit card companies or banks have to

650
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,320
reissue those cards when they know of

651
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,330
the fraud those companies have started

652
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,340
suing the businesses that had the data

653
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,350
breach saying you're responsible for our

654
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,139
cost to have to reissue each one of

655
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:24,350
these cards it may cost us you know five

656
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:26,570
dollars per card in cost of postage you

657
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,580
know manufacturing process and the

658
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,049
increased call volume we received when

659
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,120
the breach happened so you know they may

660
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:33,710
be somewhat creative in these claims but

661
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,139
in a lot of ways they may have a better

662
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,279
claim of actual injury than the consumer

663
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,769
who's affected because they have a

664
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,990
concrete cost thinking so is if I had to

665
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:45,049
reprint a credit card and reissue them

666
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,940
to 20,000 people you owe me for this

667
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,860
breech you had because of that so we

668
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,730
have those lawsuits as well that may

669
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:54,709
occur from data breaches so now I kind

670
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,509
of wanted to take you through how these

671
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,450
play out on a courtroom so i thought i'd

672
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:00,529
just i think reading from from cases and

673
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,850
reading them they'll de you do a lot of

674
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:04,039
that in law school gets a little boring

675
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,928
I thought I'd play for you part of the

676
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,149
oral argument in a case called spokeo

677
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:10,610
has anyone familiar with that spokeo

678
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:12,199
website okay got it so that's the

679
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,178
website you know what it you can do it

680
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,350
that you can look up people online so

681
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,659
the website where you can find out

682
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,070
information on people spokeo this case

683
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,409
made it all the way up to the Supreme

684
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,779
Court on a case where a person sued

685
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:26,149
spokeo saying that they put false

686
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:28,190
information about him online I won't get

687
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,199
into all the legal details of this but

688
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,759
the question it's a question called

689
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,620
standing was what was up to the Supreme

690
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,629
Court so the question was has he

691
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,668
suffered a concrete injury it doesn't

692
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:39,110
you have an injury in fact just because

693
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,629
this company may have violated a federal

694
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,519
statute about reporting information

695
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:44,300
about people online so I'll play a

696
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,780
little clip

697
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:51,230
from just justice Sotomayor asking

698
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:54,280
question argument is actionable is the

699
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:58,040
absence of real heart the question of

700
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,649
the application of the statute no I

701
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,310
think it doesn't invalidate the injury

702
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,600
here because this is the quintessential

703
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,389
violation of the statute he's saying

704
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,699
they don't have reasonable procedures to

705
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,920
check their accuracy we know from the

706
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,200
purpose section of the statute that

707
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,050
that's what Congress wanted reasonable

708
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,660
procedures he's gonna have to prove that

709
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:24,320
number two he says the information about

710
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,390
me is false I'm going to assume for

711
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,470
purposes of this argument because we

712
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:33,410
have to that and so does the court below

713
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,170
with respect to standing that much of

714
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,570
that information is inaccurate I will

715
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,900
tell you that I know plenty of single

716
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:45,020
people who look at whether someone who's

717
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,270
proposed the day is married or not so if

718
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,180
you're not married and there's a report

719
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:52,550
out there saying you are that's a

720
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,190
potential injury now I know the court

721
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,889
below said it was speculative but that's

722
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:03,500
what Congress was worried about both

723
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:05,810
credit worthiness and and your stretcher

724
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:10,280
as a person your privacy your sense of

725
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,810
self that I can identify so really the

726
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,910
kind of the key thing I want you to keep

727
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,379
in mind here is judges are people and so

728
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,960
this kind of a personal you know this

729
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,610
was there's some legal analysis here but

730
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,240
she's saying this person's allegations

731
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,219
were spokeo said I was married I'm not

732
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,020
you know and she's saying this sounds to

733
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,610
me like a real damage i can imagine a

734
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,379
situation where you know what's with

735
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,209
your damages I get less dates because

736
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,190
you know I go you know I try to meet

737
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,900
people they Google me here they look me

738
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,960
up on Spokeo and see I'm married and

739
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,120
they never returned my calls so I want

740
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,010
you to keep in mind you know the data

741
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,020
breaches and the litigation that results

742
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,850
from it's very human thing so think

743
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,290
about the facts in the circumstance is a

744
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,480
very case this wasn't a case about a

745
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,680
data breach was about privacy concerns

746
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,720
and this issue of standing is what

747
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,150
comes up in data breach litigation has

748
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,520
the person the person who's filing the

749
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,960
lawsuit really had an injury in fact so

750
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,310
I want you to think you know use your

751
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,470
own you know judges use their own

752
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,090
experiences you know when they think

753
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,740
about these things so think about the

754
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,540
circ each breaches a little different so

755
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,220
think about the circumstances of each

756
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,840
one and that's a part of what the

757
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,660
lawyers do as well to advise their

758
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,189
clients so with that in mind Oh point to

759
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,990
a case that actually involved the data

760
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,690
breach so I can how to show you how that

761
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,510
impacts the litigation the individual

762
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,940
elements in the response so this is a

763
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,820
case called this was against Neiman

764
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,530
Marcus the the stores they had a data

765
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,790
breach around the holidays this was

766
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,399
actually years ago when they had this

767
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,930
breach but you know cases take a while

768
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,440
so it made itself up to the Seventh

769
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,680
Circuit which is based in chicago in a

770
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,900
2015 and this is a quote from the or a

771
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,090
clip from the oral argument with that

772
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,600
chief giant judge diane would asking

773
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,820
questions sup kind of a cursory

774
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,070
investigation actually i thought by the

775
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:01,659
district court but here's what worries

776
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:04,840
me mean there there's no doubt that the

777
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:08,650
people that Neiman Marcus notified had

778
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,870
been subject to this data breach had

779
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,960
already suffered the data breach so

780
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:18,280
their information and from Neiman Marcus

781
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,890
his own records had been compromised and

782
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,210
people whose information is compromised

783
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:27,880
as Neiman Marcus itself recognized are

784
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,860
at a much greater risk of identity theft

785
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,300
that presumably is why they offered a

786
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:38,620
year's free credit monitoring and even

787
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,899
if which i believe is not i don't think

788
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,820
this fact is before us even if some

789
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,930
people had their their fraudulent

790
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,970
charges reimbursed identity theft

791
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,160
victims at least according to the bureau

792
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,600
of justice statistics spend a lot of

793
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,660
money to

794
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,090
put monitoring provisions into place

795
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,090
that money probably is well spent

796
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,780
according to bjs about fourteen percent

797
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,710
of identity theft victims experience

798
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:13,549
out-of-pocket losses of a dollar or more

799
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:18,500
the average cost is seventeen 1769

800
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:23,030
dollars you know it's a it's a real

801
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,980
immediate injury it seems so let's take

802
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,510
a step back how many people have by show

803
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,950
of hands have received one of these

804
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,059
letters you've been part of a data

805
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,220
breach we're going to offer you some

806
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:34,070
free credit monitoring it's a lot of

807
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,659
hands up in the room on that one has

808
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,500
anyone taken those companies up on those

809
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:41,240
offers before so certainly that takes

810
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,370
you some time and effort sign up I

811
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,559
imagine but let's kind of take a step

812
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,270
back there breach I believe in Neiman

813
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,470
Marcus didn't involve social security

814
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,629
numbers I believe it just involved

815
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,250
credit card numbers what is it you're

816
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,720
monitoring for when you get that credit

817
00:30:52,250 --> 00:31:08,870
monitoring what is your concern you're

818
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:10,460
trying to avoid exactly so the moon like

819
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,229
you said is someone opening a new line

820
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,940
of credit in your name someone has your

821
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,500
credit card number in your first name

822
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,030
and last name can they open a new line

823
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,830
of credit in your name just that

824
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,830
information do you guys think

825
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,560
just that and nothing else my guess

826
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:37,350
would be a department store card

827
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:39,510
probably not with a some depart I've

828
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,219
seen some department stores which if you

829
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,320
have a major credit card will open an

830
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,660
account for you just on that major

831
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,790
credit card Oh interesting so yeah I

832
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,040
thought the same thing this seems to be

833
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,110
a knee-jerk reaction by companies is to

834
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,750
say we've had a data breach let's just

835
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,370
offer some credit monitoring it actually

836
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,690
kind of came back to bite me and Marcus

837
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,459
a little bit with this because they had

838
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,590
to turn around and when the lawsuit was

839
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,750
filed they're arguing yeah there was

840
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,149
this lawsuit but no one was really hurt

841
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,250
you know there's no injury in fact yeah

842
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,780
we offered credit monitoring but really

843
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,610
no one really needed credit monitoring

844
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,100
it was just credit card numbers that

845
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,300
were compromised so when you have a data

846
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,709
breach I think you need to make that

847
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,780
analysis that's very interesting what

848
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,670
you said about major credit cards and

849
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,500
with that alone opening a line of credit

850
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,780
in the name but I think you need to do

851
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,760
an actual analysis and say hey with the

852
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,190
information that's been compromised you

853
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,950
know what is the threat with this and

854
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,150
what should we offer our our customers

855
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,190
should we offer credit monitoring

856
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,630
because this has legal implications down

857
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,060
the road just you offering credit

858
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,780
monitoring so this is just one oh good

859
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,639
just a question is you know you get one

860
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,260
year coverage i think t-mobile was

861
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,020
actually offering like two year coverage

862
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:54,780
for this credit you know pai

863
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,120
notification information is there how do

864
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,520
you know if one year or two years is too

865
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,260
much or too little protection once there

866
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,930
is a data breach that's an excellent

867
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,879
question i mean realistically if someone

868
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,650
has you at that information it's not

869
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,170
like they only have two years to use it

870
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,210
so it's it's it's a little bit arbitrary

871
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,070
i will tell you from representing

872
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,510
clients we know that you know a lot of

873
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,000
the states when you notify the state

874
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,440
attorney general's you also there's a

875
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,610
box where you tell them here's what

876
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,520
we're offering to people who are

877
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,409
affected and some if you say one year

878
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,210
we'll call you back or they'll send me a

879
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,280
letter and email and say hey we really

880
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,020
prefer that companies offer two years

881
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,170
for these i think it's a little

882
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,700
arbitrary but you know i think it does

883
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,380
make sense the some extent I think the

884
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,299
hackers are the people who take the data

885
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,039
probably try to use it quickly

886
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,720
before it goes stale and probably try to

887
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,669
use it before you do something like put

888
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,799
a credit freeze on your account so for

889
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:49,889
example for that W to phishing attack we

890
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,869
talked about a lot of times that one if

891
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:54,809
I'm advising a client on that even

892
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:56,519
before there is an actual requirement

893
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,230
you know states may have a 15-day or

894
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,639
30-day requirement even before we've

895
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,100
done this legal analysis of every

896
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:03,600
state's data breach notification law you

897
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,699
know and these are their employees or

898
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,080
affected I say give out a communication

899
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,040
as soon as possible and tell the people

900
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,629
set up a pen with the IRS or file your

901
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,909
taxes as soon as you can because the

902
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:17,219
hackers as soon as they get those w2s

903
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,619
are most more than likely going to try

904
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,540
to rush out and file fake tax returns

905
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,010
with that information so kind of the

906
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,319
point of this exercise I think you've

907
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,790
been picking up to is each breach is

908
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:29,730
different you know think about the

909
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,679
actual legal risk and risk the consumers

910
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,240
with each reach and respond to it

911
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,879
accordingly rather than have just this

912
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,459
knee-jerk reaction to to any data breach

913
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,618
and I think next case this breach

914
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,929
happened after Neiman Marcus highlights

915
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,720
that even further this is a again alec

916
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:48,119
from chief judge diane woods this case

917
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,138
involved PF changs restaurants and data

918
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,970
breach they have and this is gonna clip

919
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,290
from oral argument and but not one of

920
00:34:53,969 --> 00:35:00,270
the most questions about that i mean i

921
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:03,630
guess it's possible you know that a

922
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:06,809
restaurant or you know small retailer

923
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:09,450
that's part of a national chain might

924
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,819
have its own internal computer network

925
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:15,660
but i would be rather surprised about

926
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:17,520
that it's seems much more likely to me

927
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,440
that there's a corporate wide network

928
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,670
and maybe things are uploaded to it

929
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,380
every day i don't know how it works but

930
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,619
so this actually I would highlight

931
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,079
another thing lawyers and judges may not

932
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,520
always understand technology you know

933
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm a little unique that I was a

934
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,880
computer programmer a lawyer that's not

935
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,470
too often that you have people with that

936
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,270
background even I'd you know don't

937
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,040
understand you know how every network

938
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,540
works with this credit card processing I

939
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,099
used to write credit card processing

940
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,200
strips for online stores when I was

941
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:48,390
programmer so have some understanding of

942
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,098
it but you can tell judge would is

943
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,740
saying I'm not quite sure I understand

944
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,180
how this works but and then the but is

945
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,259
here's what I'm thinking anyway you know

946
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,000
they're not just going to say I don't

947
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,470
understand the technology i'm not going

948
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,890
to rule they're going to rule based on

949
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:03,868
how they imagine it works well and

950
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,600
that's with credit cards especially

951
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:09,240
that's that's causing a shift in the

952
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,640
industry my cubemate is actually

953
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,759
responsible for Purdue's payment card

954
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,730
industry compliance and both Purdue and

955
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,869
other entities are shifting towards

956
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,670
completely taking our networks at a

957
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:23,940
scope with this vendors are offering

958
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:26,010
what we call e 2 e and end systems where

959
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,420
you buy the device and it encrypts

960
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,190
everything right there at the source all

961
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,800
the way to the bank that way we don't

962
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,530
have the liability of that data resting

963
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,810
on our networks because because it is

964
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,300
such a high priority target and because

965
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,009
it really the the standards that PCI are

966
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,800
coming out with to say to protect it are

967
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,450
so difficult to me and it's because of

968
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,550
liability like this you're seeing people

969
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,770
step completely away from that yeah I

970
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,750
agree they're saying we don't want them

971
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,880
ever to touch our network especially not

972
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,430
unencrypted so you know it is Indian

973
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,020
encryption and that risk is all being

974
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,368
pushed on this process where he was

975
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,350
coming in and they were going to handle

976
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:04,290
it so yeah I completely agree with you

977
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,000
so I think you know what the interesting

978
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,859
part is how the law is shaping not

979
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,310
necessarily the technology but the

980
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:15,869
businesses reaction you know to the law

981
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:19,049
is changing how we do business and this

982
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:20,700
next clip is the last one from Judge

983
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,760
David Hamilton this was the same oral

984
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,319
argument about the PF changs breach I'll

985
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,450
give you a little bit of background but

986
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,850
I think you'll pick it up in the clip PF

987
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,350
changs in a preliminary notification to

988
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,060
all of their customers saying there's

989
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,009
been a data breach and we're not sure

990
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,720
you know who is effect which restaurants

991
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,160
were affected they then followed it up

992
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,259
with another one saying here the

993
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,990
restaurants who were affected they

994
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,060
actually won on this class action at the

995
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,129
level below the plaintiffs who brought

996
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,049
the lawsuit it turned out they never

997
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,970
even ate at the restaurants who are part

998
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,380
of the data breach PF changs moved to

999
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,089
dismiss the lawsuit saying they weren't

1000
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,859
even part of this data breach the

1001
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,100
district court for that reason and some

1002
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:01,319
others the trial court level ruled in PF

1003
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,150
changs favor the case then came up to

1004
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,130
the Seventh Circuit on appeal and this

1005
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,460
was after the Neiman Marcus decision and

1006
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:11,619
you'll kind of see how this plays

1007
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:14,970
out counsel given the logic of Neiman

1008
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:17,380
Marcus I guess I don't understand why

1009
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,509
somebody can't have standing by just

1010
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:23,200
saying I've read this PF chang press

1011
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,970
release I've been a customer I've got a

1012
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,950
reasonable fear that my data has been

1013
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,868
compromised so I'm going to take these

1014
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,000
precautionary measures well is it a

1015
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,980
reasonable fear if PF changs says we've

1016
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,380
had 33 stores that have had a problem

1017
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,510
and you didn't dine at one of those 33

1018
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,060
stores well first of all the press

1019
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,359
release the June press release doesn't

1020
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:46,270
tell me which stores it says we don't

1021
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,640
know how extensive this is we are taking

1022
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,400
you are taking precautionary measures

1023
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,868
all over the United States why isn't it

1024
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,480
reasonable for your customers to take

1025
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,880
similar precautionary measure I have my

1026
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,470
eyes on and you let me tell you the

1027
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,140
lawyer when you're starting off but what

1028
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,899
happened was there a good flight the V

1029
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,150
at oral argument so I guess what it was

1030
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,890
based on just listen this clip what

1031
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:14,589
lessons do you see from about

1032
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:16,540
preliminary notifications it sounds like

1033
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,950
if a company have all your ducks in a

1034
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,630
row right from the beginning before you

1035
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,160
actually declare formulation yeah thank

1036
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,170
you guys sounds like a company and

1037
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,390
exercising overabundance of caution can

1038
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,609
paint itself in the corner exactly

1039
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,650
sometimes it's best sometimes their best

1040
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:32,890
legal advice maybe don't say anything

1041
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,720
yet we have this joke when we have a

1042
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,910
company have a data breach a client of

1043
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,669
data breach and tell us what happened we

1044
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:42,040
like write this down now and 24 hours

1045
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,589
again check what the story is now and

1046
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,660
another 24 hours later see what the

1047
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:48,279
story is then because the initial facts

1048
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,779
you get it's not the people are lying

1049
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,910
you know just informations coming in

1050
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,500
quickly it's not coming a lot of times

1051
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,950
to us directly from the sea so it's

1052
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,170
coming third or second hand the

1053
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:01,000
information you get may not always be

1054
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,440
accurate or you make just not know p of

1055
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,570
trains probably at that point of time

1056
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,580
when they set the pleura a notice said

1057
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,500
we don't know if it's every store or

1058
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,810
just some stores we're going to notify

1059
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,859
all of our customers because that maybe

1060
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,320
they just thought that's the right thing

1061
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:16,119
to do i think it came back to buy them

1062
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,700
here because have their first notice

1063
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,369
said oh you know had to notice came up

1064
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,558
you know a week later let's say

1065
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:25,170
here the people at the 33 stores who are

1066
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,549
affected they may not have even been in

1067
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,650
this class action so as you may have

1068
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:31,109
guessed from that or argument the case

1069
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,700
got the dismissal was overturned and the

1070
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,558
case went back to the district court and

1071
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,288
I believe that class action is still

1072
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,529
going on against PF changs but it

1073
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:43,200
definitely was reinstated after that I I

1074
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:44,940
had an experience of being on the and

1075
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,399
probably several people here have being

1076
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,599
on the opposite end of someone who

1077
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:57,269
basically did not notify until they had

1078
00:40:51,599 --> 00:41:00,089
a strong belief and even then in my case

1079
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:02,098
my notice required going to them and

1080
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:04,680
thinking I think I was a member of this

1081
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:07,410
breach can you check that's when they

1082
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,598
finally said oh yes you were that's the

1083
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:12,149
office of personnel management Wow yeah

1084
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,220
and so that that's the downside the

1085
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,749
other of the worse is they come out

1086
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,240
looking really bad because they can't

1087
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:21,720
even notify people properly yeah and

1088
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,399
that's you know the other risk is you

1089
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,109
decide you don't know enough yet and

1090
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,029
don't notify people and how many people

1091
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,578
read Brian Krebs if you ever guys ever

1092
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,170
read Krebs online on security so and

1093
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,690
then there's a report from Brian Krebs

1094
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,249
reports on these saying hey your

1095
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,349
information is all on the dark web about

1096
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:39,058
all your customers and then it's picked

1097
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,009
up by the press and you have it set

1098
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,589
notification letters out they need a

1099
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:46,019
whole other kind of legal legal risk

1100
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:47,759
area as well so the kind of the point of

1101
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:50,399
this is exercising going through these

1102
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:52,559
oral argument eclipses you know these

1103
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,210
decisions that get made very quickly

1104
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,859
like should we notify people right now

1105
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:59,009
should we wait until we know which

1106
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:00,390
stores those things play a huge part in

1107
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:02,339
the litigation that comes down the road

1108
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,259
decisions that may you know maybe you

1109
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,960
think are a little smaller at the time

1110
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:08,730
end up making you know this could be a

1111
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,579
multi-million dollar difference in what

1112
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,259
PF changs ends up paying in this case so

1113
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,269
you know these are little decisions

1114
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:16,710
either just kind of examples there are

1115
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:18,390
other decisions that need to be made

1116
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,670
during a litigation like whether to

1117
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:23,430
involve law enforcement whether to hire

1118
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,019
a PR firm you know who's going to make

1119
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,269
the reports to the board about what's

1120
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,950
happened those little what may seem to

1121
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:31,859
be little decisions may have a huge

1122
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,990
impact later on the litigation so I say

1123
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:36,779
this too because some of you may be as

1124
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,790
someday working as ceases or tech

1125
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,260
companies and wonder why is the lawyer

1126
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,850
asking me these questions or why are

1127
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,680
they doing this why are there so many

1128
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,750
details and that's the reason why

1129
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,379
because we want to know as many facts as

1130
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:52,260
we can and know what facts we don't know

1131
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,060
before we make a decision or or you know

1132
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,770
it affects how we will give our client

1133
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:00,720
advice about what to do during a data

1134
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:03,030
breach another any questions on the data

1135
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,240
breach aspect but i find this topic

1136
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,590
fascinating because you know as a lawyer

1137
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,939
a lot of times the question is you know

1138
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,560
what a lawyer's do you know you had a

1139
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,180
break send out these notification

1140
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,680
letters what's the big deal i like to

1141
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,960
point out you know what you put in those

1142
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,060
letters and when you release them can

1143
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,080
make a big difference down the road it's

1144
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,000
something you don't see right at the

1145
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,200
time but you'll see here is later when

1146
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,930
there's litigation so in another class

1147
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:35,580
the Sony breach was discussed and he

1148
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:37,410
went to court and basically Sony was

1149
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,210
able to basically take the position that

1150
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:43,319
the hackers are to blame the case was

1151
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:44,490
dismissed is that typically kind of the

1152
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,060
state of the art if you will in most

1153
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:53,040
these court decisions or do they finally

1154
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:54,600
put some I don't hate to say playing but

1155
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,020
yeah without talking about Sonny

1156
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,720
specifically i can say that i think the

1157
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,090
trend is and like i said judges are

1158
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,970
people the early on these cases used to

1159
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,220
get dismissed every time you know i

1160
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,169
would say the consumer class action case

1161
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,060
was you don't have standing you don't

1162
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,070
really have an injury you know the

1163
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,109
company was the victim here and they

1164
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,970
would get dismissed i think the trend is

1165
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:20,250
going the other way especially here in

1166
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,330
the seventh circuit which is Indiana

1167
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:26,160
Illinois this region here in Wisconsin

1168
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,500
you know the trim for courts now is to

1169
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,240
find plaintiffs do have an injury and I

1170
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,760
think honestly it's because judges are

1171
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,979
people and maybe some of them have dealt

1172
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,200
with the frustration that they may claim

1173
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,670
frustration in you know I've been a part

1174
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,379
of this breach I don't have to you know

1175
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,970
everything i had a reoccurring recurring

1176
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,100
payment of i have to change that

1177
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,600
financial information so i think that

1178
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,930
may be part of the reason i think

1179
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,049
eventually it was a spoke

1180
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,029
okay is provided some clarity the lower

1181
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:54,040
courts on the Supreme Court case we

1182
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,510
listen to clip on earlier on whether

1183
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,210
plaintiffs have standing but that really

1184
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:59,800
was in a data breach case and so I think

1185
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,690
eventually this may make its way to the

1186
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,030
Supreme Court and they never be some

1187
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,430
more guidance but I think right now it

1188
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,960
depends on circuit so the u.s. is split

1189
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,578
into these different circuits and in

1190
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,740
federal court so it really depends on

1191
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:14,020
what court you're in on whether those

1192
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,209
claims will survive and I think the

1193
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:22,210
trend has been pushing more towards

1194
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:24,520
those claims surviving another example

1195
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,980
of litigation there's this there was an

1196
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,050
advanced auto parts case this was one

1197
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,119
there's actually a lawsuit as a result

1198
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,950
of this w to phishing scam we talked

1199
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,780
about earlier in this case that a

1200
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,379
following up on you said it actually got

1201
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:41,380
got dismissed the court found that the

1202
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:43,780
company then the the plaintiffs didn't

1203
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,849
have any cognizable injuries found that

1204
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,069
the company was was duped into this

1205
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:50,650
fishing type of tack it really looked at

1206
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:52,299
the company is a victim and found that

1207
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,069
the other side really the plaintiffs

1208
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:56,770
didn't really have any injury from this

1209
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:58,480
case so I think you know these ones are

1210
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,609
newer attacks of course may be less

1211
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,890
familiar with those as well but so the

1212
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:04,930
cases I've seen come from those W to

1213
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,180
phishing attacks so far I have not seen

1214
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,669
any successful litigation by the

1215
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,910
employees or people whose you know w-2s

1216
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,770
are lost against their employer kind of

1217
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,359
like the data breaches generally the

1218
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,210
consumer ones that may be changing as

1219
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:21,220
well so you're saying on this one none

1220
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:23,079
of these employees suffered problems

1221
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,808
getting your refunds because the w2's

1222
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,270
got out there and no one filed any

1223
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:30,040
claims so the there is funny thing about

1224
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,720
this one I think at this point these

1225
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,609
people and claim their injury with some

1226
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,589
credit inquiries that it had made and

1227
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:37,420
the court found that those don't

1228
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:39,750
constitute an injury the funny thing

1229
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,160
about there being so many data breaches

1230
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,530
one of the defense's companies can use

1231
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,960
in the litigation is we don't know how

1232
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,660
your information was lost as yes we lost

1233
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,280
it but so did you know all of these

1234
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,109
other companies we can list that you

1235
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,240
also were part of that breach I can tell

1236
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,770
you from when we offer the credit

1237
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,419
monitoring so we partner with a vendor

1238
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,460
or different vendors when we offer

1239
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,470
credit monitoring

1240
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,940
our clients in a breach and we can

1241
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,470
actually see the statistics how many

1242
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,500
people take the company up on that offer

1243
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,629
and the levels are minimal and a lot of

1244
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,070
times sometimes we see less than nine

1245
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,080
percent or three percent of people

1246
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:15,000
actually do the monitoring and I think

1247
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,380
the reason why is because if they wanted

1248
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,660
free credit monitoring at this point

1249
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,010
they probably could get it because

1250
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,560
they've been a victim of some other

1251
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,390
breach so I think you have a defense

1252
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,590
here that companies are able to use it

1253
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,660
says you know there are so many

1254
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,550
different ways the attackers could have

1255
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,290
gotten your information how do you know

1256
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,360
it came from our breach and I think

1257
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,680
that's a difficult thing for plaintiffs

1258
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,930
to prove you know how do you prove that

1259
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,960
you know I've had a breach 5 lost your

1260
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:42,120
w-2 and you go to file your return and

1261
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,650
it says it's already been filed you know

1262
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,790
that's some circumstantial evidence that

1263
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,490
you know someone got your information

1264
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:49,710
but if I'm defending the company i may

1265
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,240
say you know who else has your social

1266
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,730
security number you know did you put it

1267
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,020
on an application for a ripple form did

1268
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,790
you you know use it when you had your

1269
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,270
cable installed and look and see if

1270
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:01,590
those companies had breaches as well w 2

1271
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,540
would seem a little bit different

1272
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,300
because you need a dish when you file

1273
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:10,550
your taxes you either enclose the w-2 or

1274
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,870
you include in the electronic filing

1275
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,250
substantial information from the w-2

1276
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,410
that would not be available from other

1277
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,510
sources so that one's an interesting one

1278
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,980
so what we've found with that and

1279
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,810
there's some articles about this is that

1280
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,250
they typically will target public

1281
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,049
employees because their salary

1282
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,910
informations online if you're a state

1283
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,950
employee so I know some colleges have

1284
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:31,319
been hit with this you can look up a lot

1285
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,299
of information just publicly about them

1286
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,100
that you need to file the fake tax

1287
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,200
return so as long as you have the social

1288
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,700
you can figure it you know you can get

1289
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,740
for any state employees in public

1290
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,240
website you can see what their salary is

1291
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,279
you can probably see where they work

1292
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,290
probably had a lot of those details that

1293
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,460
you would need to file that tax return

1294
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,500
but knowing the amounts of withholding

1295
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,470
and set cetera I think you would

1296
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,210
actually go to and get the w-2 or get

1297
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,740
the tax return you should be able to

1298
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,870
compare that and say look this is a

1299
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,729
match to the w-2 or it's not you know at

1300
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,980
the KU there's a lot of link amazing

1301
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,780
what they submitted to the IRS yeah but

1302
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,970
that's a lot of work for a plaintiff's

1303
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,740
firm to do and so this is getting the

1304
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,020
legal side so when you have a class

1305
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,339
action you has to have to show to be

1306
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,290
able to bring a lawsuit on behalf

1307
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,790
large group of people there's an inquiry

1308
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,950
that could be done doesn't have to be

1309
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,810
done on an individualized basis so that

1310
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,649
would be an inquiry as a defense

1311
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,110
attorney I'd say that's an

1312
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,300
individualized basis inquiry so yes this

1313
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:26,250
individual person may have a great claim

1314
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,900
against my client they can show they've

1315
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,940
matched up all those things but it's

1316
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,670
really hard to bring that as a class and

1317
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,740
say every single person whose w2 is

1318
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,120
taken has that same claim because now

1319
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,370
you're having to do an inquiry for each

1320
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,130
one and so as a plaintiff's attorney a

1321
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:44,069
single one person case not worth a lot

1322
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:46,170
of money huge class is worth a lot of

1323
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,730
money so it's more difficult if you're

1324
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,160
having to say we need to do an inquiry

1325
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,900
for each person so that that's that's

1326
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,330
how you defeat class actions one of the

1327
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,560
ways to say it requires so as a defense

1328
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,120
attorney I'd say that requires an

1329
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,490
interval edge individualized inquiry

1330
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,930
cart so you know maybe they have a claim

1331
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:05,250
but the class action should be dismissed

1332
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:07,830
I thought there was another question or

1333
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,270
he'll answer my question okay gotcha but

1334
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,680
I haven't thought of that that's a good

1335
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,810
idea I think it's a plaintiff's lawyer

1336
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,940
that would be a smart thing to do is say

1337
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:18,029
because it's going to be difficult for

1338
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,970
you to say this breeks you know came or

1339
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,830
this adverse effect on my client came

1340
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,359
from your particular data breach so you

1341
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,940
know whatever you could do to show that

1342
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,830
I think would be a it would be the way

1343
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:34,680
to establish it it's really that's all I

1344
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:36,960
had I you know any questions feel free

1345
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,730
to ask I will answer any questions about

1346
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,350
the time I can't they except for about

1347
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,180
the time I came here for breakfast clubs

1348
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:49,049
since we're being retarded but you can

1349
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:49,259
ask those off the record thank you

1350
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,359
you

1351
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,359
[Applause]

1352
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,610
you
