00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,670
is the start of our year of celebration

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,740
as as Jerry Hahn has has deemed it so

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,289
right now we are celebrating the 25th

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,109
anniversary of coast so Coast was the

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,449
first security dedicated laboratory at

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,230
Purdue started by Professor Spafford and

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,140
professor Wagstaff quickly grew and six

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,550
years later after that Sirius was born

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,190
from coast

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,589
so right now 25th anniversary started

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,629
this spring 25 years ago this spring in

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,180

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:23,039
were there to support them later tonight

29
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:25,350
is our celebration party for Coast that

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,380
will be also the serious poster session

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,390
so as an opportunity to see I believe 53

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,490
different research projects that are

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,890
being managed here at Purdue all within

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,360
the area of the information assurance

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,329
security privacy resiliency and

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,619
cybercrime so come celebrate with us and

37
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,939
come learn more about the research

38
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,630
that's going on here at Purdue with

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,389
serious and with that I'd like to bring

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,520
up our first our first presenter this

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,960
morning in stuff in is the chief

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,610
innovation officer for the state of

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,679
Indiana and we've had the pleasure of

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,289
this last year getting to work closely

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,740
with in and his staff at the Indiana

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,719
Economic Development Corporation their

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,149
tagline which you have probably seen or

48
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,600
will see very soon here is a state that

49
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,090
works

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,910
and while serious has a very very broad

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,010
global view it is wonderful to have a

52
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,840
supportive state that helps both what

53
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,040
we're trying to do here in the state but

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,719
also off-campus

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,578
so Ian thank you very much for your

56
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,099
support of Sirius and Purdue University

57
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:32,670
and welcome to Purdue thank you very

58
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:34,939
much good morning on behalf of the

59
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,790
governor and our Secretary of Commerce

60
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:42,689
welcome to this symposium I was invited

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,500
to speak this morning back in January

62
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,420
when Joe and I were going around the the

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,790
State of Israel for the cyber tech

64
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,349
summit there so we were over there for a

65
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,670
week and you really get to know someone

66
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,730
when you're in the back of the van

67
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,918
traveling hours around small roads in

68
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,409
Israel going back and forth but what we

69
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,560
did learn there was that we have great

70
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,480
partners in the State of Israel while we

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,299
were well we were over there some of

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,108
whom are are here today on behalf of the

73
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:15,480
state again welcome looking forward to

74
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:19,650
this symposium today I'd like to call

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,440
out our state's cyber security adviser

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,269
Doug Rapp Doug Rapp if you could raise

77
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,970
your hand he'll be here throughout the

78
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,060
two days of the symposium so feel free

79
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,000
to track him down as well you know I've

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,099
been in this capacity for the last three

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,500
years serving under governor pence and

82
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,198
now governor Holcomb and I can tell you

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,970
that as I travel around the state you

84
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,250
know I see billion-dollar industries

85
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,639
solving billion-dollar challenges every

86
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,819
day in a diversified set of sectors

87
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,909
whether it's agriculture pharma advanced

88
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,708
manufacturing aerospace and defense we

89
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,459
have those industries here that are

90
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,959
solving the next challenges that are

91
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,060
opposed to us and certainly the

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,669
cybersecurity industry is one that's

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,519
taking off strong here in the state of

94
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,760
Indiana as well we have many growing

95
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,159
cyber security firms including ponderin

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,209
Sand rook security and Kenny group and

97
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,769
many others that continue to grow I

98
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,409
would also say that it's an exciting

99
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,960
time to be in the state of Indiana as we

100
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:28,200
look forward to our third century of

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,710
innovation here in the state I would say

102
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,200
that you know we just celebrated our 200

103
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,200
your anniversary and this is a state

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,780
that continuously performs works and

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,020
it's a state that makes things grow

106
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,210
strings connects things and moves things

107
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,280
and you can't do any of those things

108
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:52,870
without securing those those

109
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,520
transmissions as well as the secure

110
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,640
transformation of our information

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,099
technology sector I would say that cyber

112
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,039
security is the fastest growing area in

113
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,350
the tech sector that we see here in the

114
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,570
state of Indiana and one of the fastest

115
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,280
growing industries in the world you

116
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,950
don't need me to tell you that you live

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,650
and work in that field I would also say

118
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,659
that the cyber security market has not

119
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,390
escaped our attention in terms of its

120
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,950
great growth so in the last 13 years

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,099
growing from three and a half billion

122
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,390
dollars in 2004 to one hundred and

123
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,780
twenty billion in 2017 I started off in

124
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,940
the semiconductor industry our worldwide

125
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,299
market share was three hundred and

126
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,340
thirty three billion dollars annually

127
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,640
and I have not seen the type of growth

128
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,169
in any industry since my experience in

129
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,789
that industry than I have seen in the

130
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,740
cyber security industry so

131
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,770
congratulations for those students in

132
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,300
the room you've chosen the right field

133
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,419
the market is predicted to grow eight to

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,240
fifteen percent each year for the next

135
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,130
five years worldwide cyber security

136
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,920
products will eclipse one trillion

137
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,810
dollars in the same five years think

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,540
about that one trillion dollars in the

139
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,240
same five years the market will grow

140
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,460
comparable to the growth of the rate of

141
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,310
the Internet of Things an industry that

142
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,950
I grew up in you know you guys were

143
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,470
talking about IOT before it was cool and

144
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,520
certainly IOT would not exist without

145
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,350
cyber security IOT let me be clear is

146
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,590
one of the strategic sectors for the

147
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,860
state of Indiana it is one of seven

148
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:37,520
strategic sectors and we were proud to

149
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,230
announce the first IOT lab through the

150
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,820
the leadership of mayor fatness and

151
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,340
Fisher's earlier this year

152
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,860
Purdue IU and many other University

153
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,448
these are a part of that IOT lab IOT

154
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,010
labs that will grow throughout the state

155
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,690
this is the first state that has done

156
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,389
anything like it

157
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,729
worldwide spending in terms of cyber

158
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,090
security protection seventy five point

159
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:03,810
four billion dollars in 2015 and it

160
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,299
certainly shows no signs of slowing the

161
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,550
increasing threat and the increasing

162
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,620
opportunity in my view will continue to

163
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,979
shape the market not only here in the

164
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,930
state of Indiana but worldwide threats

165
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,909
to the Indiana economy so we look at

166
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,130
opportunities at the Indiana Economic

167
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,800
Development Corporation and we look at

168
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,560
opportunities general threats include

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,770
nation states cyber criminals hackers

170
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,130
hacktivists lone wolf insider threats

171
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,500
and 2016 cyber crime cost the global

172
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,479
economy over four hundred fifty billion

173
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,660
dollars four hundred and fifty billion

174
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,150
dollars over two billion personal

175
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,460
records were stolen in the u.s. myself

176
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,198
included given my federal government

177
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,950
experience I was the recipient of

178
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,060
multiple letters and I'll tell you

179
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,080
certainly a great deal of disappointment

180
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,880
there as well but certainly opportunity

181
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,250
many leading industry experts predict

182
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,770
the three top threats for 2017 will be

183
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,289
ransomware extortion attacks on

184
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,810
industrial control systems and again

185
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,550
insider threats eighty percent of

186
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,620
ransomware attacks are in the healthcare

187
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,440
industry so many of you are here in the

188
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,270
healthcare industry you certainly know

189
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,090
that very well personal health

190
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,370
information is 50 times more valuable in

191
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,099
the black market than financial

192
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,770
information stolen patient health

193
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:28,530
records can fetch as much as $60 per

194
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,250
record and certainly the market is

195
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,500
demonstrating a need for scaled

196
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,969
solutions for businesses and many of

197
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,830
those small businesses that we see

198
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,789
around the state those small businesses

199
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,500
that are just trying to come to grasp

200
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,500
the situation in which they find

201
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,240
themselves in so the Indiana initiatives

202
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,790
here are the opportunities what are we

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,829
doing here and Doug and can certainly

204
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,240
tell you a little bit more about this as

205
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,390
well throughout the course of the two

206
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,950
days simply put our goal is to establish

207
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,710
Indiana is a worldwide leader in

208
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,410
cybersecurity to be the nucleus of

209
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,900
cybersecurity in the region and without

210
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,400
serious that doesn't happen so I will

211
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,110
make that very clear without Purdue

212
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,240
University without many of the

213
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,730
universities throughout our great state

214
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,570
that will not happen so that's number

215
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,190
one we are also developing a strategy

216
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,540
that supports the governor's five

217
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,770
strategic pillars IDC is currently

218
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,900
producing its final draft of our

219
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,410
cybersecurity economic development plan

220
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,290
that will be public and shared and

221
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,670
fortunately many of you in this room

222
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,010
will have an opportunity to weigh in on

223
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,530
that plan with Doug this is very good

224
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,540
timing as he will be incorporating the

225
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,959
feedback from this conference into that

226
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,599
final report so track down Doug rap on

227
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,580
the economic development plan certainly

228
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,650
private industry and the university

229
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,370
input will be very important as that

230
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:02,300
plan comes to fruition in April 2016 I

231
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,830
had the good fortune of working with the

232
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,439
governor and the Secretary of Commerce

233
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,570
on the announcement of the formation of

234
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,960
the Indiana State Executive Council on

235
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,750
cyber security so again a trailblazing

236
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,390
state we're the first state to have the

237
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,720
cybersecurity Council of which Purdue

238
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,770
participates and it very much is charged

239
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,250
as a public-private partnership that

240
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,050
will be tasked with enhancing Indiana's

241
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,510
ability to prevent respond to and

242
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,180
recover from also cyber security issues

243
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,150
and more importantly draw on the

244
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,770
experience of the private sector without

245
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,390
the private sector in this room the

246
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,699
council would be you know quite

247
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,860
meaningless in my view and certainly the

248
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,550
private sector has embraced this council

249
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,430
that will pave new paths for us here in

250
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,540
Indiana some of you may have heard about

251
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,790
the 1 billion dollar innovation agenda

252
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,819
the 1 billion dollar innovation and

253
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:05,599
entrepreneurship agenda was started by

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,000
governor pence in July of 2016

255
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,230
governor Holcomb has fully embraced that

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,430
agenda it's one that I lead on behalf

257
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,490
the Indiana Economic Development

258
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,599
Corporation 1 billion dollars over 10

259
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,790
years what does that look like well a

260
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,100
great deal of that 1 billion dollars

261
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,670
will be devoted to venture capital

262
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,450
investments in fields that are strategic

263
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,969
to the state like cybersecurity like IOT

264
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,670
we have seen that our venture capital

265
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,600
deployment continues to rise

266
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:44,110
but our it is also a risk if we don't

267
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,090
keep up with our neighbors we will not

268
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,680
have the type of small business growth

269
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,340
and start-up growth that we would like

270
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,310
to see so about a half a billion dollars

271
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,400
will be devoted to venture capital I'm

272
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,349
also calling this a hundred million

273
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,120
dollar fund as part of that 1 billion

274
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,100
dollar initiative it's called the

275
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,970
industry driven innovation partnership

276
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:11,380
fund this will spur industry investments

277
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:15,220
in strategic sectors in areas like like

278
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,460
cybersecurity I would say that what this

279
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,590
will look like is a group of industry

280
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,410
coming together alongside a university

281
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,210
and suggesting here are some challenges

282
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,300
that we want to solve over a multi-year

283
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,030
period they will bring cost share to the

284
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,930
table and Sirius is a great platform to

285
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,730
help organize such an industry-led

286
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,650
effort so that's a hundred million

287
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,320
dollars over ten years I felt very

288
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,880
strongly that we needed to enhance our

289
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,780
public-private partnerships in our

290
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,170
strategic sectors across the board when

291
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:53,290
I first came to this position we started

292
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,120
off a few other partnerships and the

293
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,099
composites Institute's some of you might

294
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,210
be familiar with the Indiana

295
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,540
manufacturing Institute here at Purdue

296
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,470
that was enabled by seed funding from a

297
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,240
similar fund

298
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,570
we're just taking that and putting it on

299
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,450
steroids and I would say that we're very

300
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,790
excited about that so that in a nutshell

301
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,140
is the one billion dollar initiative

302
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,089
there are a few other components

303
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,340
including a transferability of our

304
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,100
venture capital Tax Credit which will

305
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:25,340
enable additional startups throughout

306
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:28,820
this exciting space Indiana's great

307
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,650
assets as we look around we're standing

308
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,390
in one of them and it's not just because

309
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,220
my wife graduated from this fine

310
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,960
institution of which she's always fond

311
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,570
of reminding me that you know the first

312
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,270
and last man to walk on the moon

313
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,830
graduated from this school I would say

314
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,199
certainly our great research

315
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,290
universities you know put our state on

316
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,570
the map in this field and others I came

317
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,020
to know Indiana from my experience in

318
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,870
the semiconductor industry where I was

319
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,670
supporting partnerships called the focus

320
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,150
center research program here at Purdue

321
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:05,300
later known as the dastar net program

322
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:07,910
where industry Intel TI micron and

323
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,849
others were supporting a six point one

324
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,339
research at Purdue at Notre Dame and

325
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,080
others across the state so I firmly

326
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,820
believe that that is the direction that

327
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,029
we need to go we need a spur industry to

328
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,430
do more and you know certainly that is a

329
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:25,010
great asset our great work force our

330
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,739
extraordinary work force in this field

331
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,319
and others continue to differentiate our

332
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,600
state not only on a national scene but

333
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,240
on an international scene we saw that in

334
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,000
Israel we saw it in India we saw it

335
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,310
throughout many of the destinations at

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,950
the secretary and I travel to and our

337
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,890
workforce put us on the map what we need

338
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,270
to do is ensure that students graduating

339
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,240
from this fine University have

340
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,220
opportunities after they graduate simply

341
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,200
put that is the challenge and that is

342
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,300
what I hope comes out of this conference

343
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,980
as well talking about you know what does

344
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,870
that workforce need to look like and

345
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,120
what are some of those potential

346
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,930
economic opportunities that we see in

347
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,160
this field IEDC

348
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,770
conducted a series of seven

349
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,189
cybersecurity town halls across the

350
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,230
state that Doug Rapp Ladin from

351
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,110
Evansville Columbus Fort Wayne West

352
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:22,070
Lafayette Westgate and Bloomington we

353
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,900
made a very sincere and genuine effort

354
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,480
to get out there in the field and listen

355
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,110
firsthand to small businesses to large

356
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,520
ones to local community leaders that

357
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,589
really wanted to roll up their sleeves

358
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,150
and figure out how could they be a part

359
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,610
of the cybersecurity economic

360
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,880
development plan whether it was securing

361
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,069
information

362
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,740
or coming into compliance with new

363
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,930
federal regulations certainly there was

364
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,269
a sincere interest in being a part of

365
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,219
this growing group and I would say that

366
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:53,100
it's an extraordinary effort that has

367
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,220
brought communities from across the

368
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,230
state together to formulate what will be

369
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,690
Indiana's cybersecurity economic

370
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,500
development plan during the town halls

371
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,269
the IEDC

372
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,370
created a survey to conduct a

373
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,620
cybersecurity asset inventory and

374
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,110
solicit feedback from the industry all

375
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,240
of this will be published very soon so

376
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,779
I'm very proud of that effort and Doug

377
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,339
thank you for leading it the IDC is also

378
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,899
engaged in both national and

379
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,940
international cybersecurity efforts

380
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:24,209
through participation in events like the

381
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,819
cyber tech which was in Israel blackhat

382
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,069
RSA the ICS conference in an

383
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,990
international resiliency conference I

384
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:33,240
will say that as the chief innovation

385
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,889
officer there are many conferences that

386
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,649
come across my desk that you know over

387
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,240
the 770 staff that you know report in

388
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,639
through that in innovation

389
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,100
entrepreneurship department want to go

390
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,779
to want to represent the state I will

391
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,529
say that I think in the cybersecurity

392
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:52,500
field we're about 90% there and full

393
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,759
coverage of these events why because in

394
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,279
order to lead you have to be at the

395
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,800
table you have to be there and you have

396
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,380
to demonstrate that not only is Indiana

397
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,719
place to grow your business and expand

398
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,390
it but it's a state that wants to be

399
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,089
kept in the loop and helped define and

400
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,959
shape the future of this industry so I

401
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:15,928
would say that again that that is very

402
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,390
important so from the town halls to you

403
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:21,089
know the universities to the work force

404
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,900
that we have here I would also say that

405
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,270
over 30 academic institutions in Indiana

406
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,210
have a cybersecurity information

407
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:32,549
security specific course focus area

408
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,580
certificate and over 70 with degrees

409
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,620
related to cybersecurity analysts you

410
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,210
know that's important that is very

411
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,500
important that our university community

412
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,330
our community college have realized the

413
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,150
growing opportunities in this field and

414
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:52,408
have adjusted the curricula accordingly

415
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,590
I would say that survey respondents to

416
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,900
the

417
00:17:52,590 --> 00:18:00,720
dc's work said that innovation and

418
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,419
entrepreneurship is only second to

419
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,010
academia as Indiana's greatest assets so

420
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:08,159
there is a culture of innovation a

421
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,158
culture of that pioneering spirit here

422
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,220
in Indiana one that you know encourages

423
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,080
folks to want to stay here I would say

424
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,730
the investment climate you know when

425
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,658
we're on the road people are well aware

426
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,520
of the low tax rate here but also you

427
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:26,010
know the triple-a bond rating you know

428
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,418
we're a state that is consistently you

429
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,908
know saving for the future and that's

430
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,440
what enables us quite frankly to invest

431
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,360
a billion dollars over ten years you

432
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,950
don't see some of our neighbors you know

433
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,799
doing that because there's just simply

434
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,130
not in a position to do that I would say

435
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,399
that research was identified as one of

436
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,380
the top Indiana assets Indiana is home

437
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:47,820
to the six major research institutions

438
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,240
and some of whom I've already mentioned

439
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,520
and numerous NSA and DHS academic and

440
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,890
research centers of excellence so that

441
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,908
certainly puts us on the map

442
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,340
Indiana is home to the some of the

443
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:02,159
world's first complex cybersecurity

444
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,820
training some of you are familiar with

445
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:10,169
the Muscatatuck and the urban training

446
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,600
center down south I would say last year

447
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:16,669
the state teamed up with companies and

448
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,760
universities to conduct a full-scale

449
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:23,370
exercise named critics that included

450
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,929
over six major water providers the

451
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,719
military the state the national

452
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:30,450
emergency management organizations so we

453
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,279
not only have access to people but we

454
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,110
have access to shared infrastructure and

455
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,970
if any of you have not been to

456
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,399
Muscatatuck it's certainly something

457
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,919
that you need to check out and something

458
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:44,370
certainly industry is very much

459
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:47,460
interested in leveraging NSWC crane is

460
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,010
also very important to us in southern

461
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,950
indiana the center of electronic warfare

462
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:56,460
for the country and the third largest

463
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,340
Navy base in the world is in Indiana in

464
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,440
southern Indiana and crane the battery

465
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,408
Innovation Center right on the outskirts

466
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,269
of the crane Navy base you know

467
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:09,119
certainly something that is of

468
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:11,489
great deal and importance to the cyber

469
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,549
ramifications to the electric grid we

470
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:18,119
have that that shared infrastructure

471
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:20,369
available to us and lastly Indiana does

472
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,218
very well in cybersecurity and digital

473
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:25,889
forensics the partnership with the

474
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:28,549
Indiana State Police and Purdue you know

475
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:30,869
certainly is on our radar screen and

476
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,059
securing industrial control system

477
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:34,978
securing the internet of things that I

478
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:38,099
you Purdue and crane have partnered on

479
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:40,379
and managing security services through a

480
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,779
number of cyber security providers both

481
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,029
in-state and out-of-state so I would

482
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:49,559
just conclude by encouraging you to

483
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:53,070
think big throughout these two days I'm

484
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,609
pleased that Joel is continuing to

485
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,639
encourage folks to think big and to

486
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:04,499
bring the right people together from DHS

487
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:05,789
to to the State Police to IADC I mean

488
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:08,519
you're really approaching it from all

489
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:10,379
angles here but also think about what do

490
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,019
those public-private partnerships need

491
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:15,509
to look like to and continue to ensure

492
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,339
that Indiana is not only different but

493
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,489
Indiana will maintain our leadership

494
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:23,879
role in this strategic sector throughout

495
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:26,399
our diversified manufacturing and life

496
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,589
sciences base we need to take advantage

497
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:31,768
of those assets and I'm sure the people

498
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:33,958
in this room will chart new

499
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:37,259
public/private partnerships that will

500
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,839
encourage folks to not only stay here

501
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,690
but to come here because of them so with
