1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,850
yesterday we had a fascinating keynote

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,510
from general tool today we have a

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,759
keynote from our industry representative

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,180
and there's some history associated with

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,180
this as well

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,000
somebody was commenting they can tell

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,698
I'm getting older because I continue to

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,490
reminisce this is this is sort of part

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,840
of that this is also the 25th

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,000
anniversary of the first release of the

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,200
public version of tripwire it was

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,930
released to the general public on

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:46,220
November 2nd of 1992 and how many of you

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,300
know the significance of November 2nd

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,820
really Wow

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,849
okay well that was the anniversary of

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,620
the Morris internet worm but that was

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,020
also the day that gene Kim and I decided

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,269
to release the first public version of

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:09,000
tripwire 25 years ago this year and 20

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,710
years ago gene Kim wyatt Starnes myself

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,950
and a few others came up with the idea

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,030
for tripwire the company and in 20 years

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,990
it has grown to be one of the premier

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,760
security companies in business today

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,009
going back about those 20 years there

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,040
was a student at Carnegie Mellon who was

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,810
working in computing and was exploring

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,460
hacking systems and looking into some of

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,049
what was available and got really

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,669
involved with the community doing that

32
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,310
to the point where he became a co-editor

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:45,090
of one of the underground magazines

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:47,430
frack when Chris Klaus started ISS

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,079
basically he built a scanner he was

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,990
inspired by what we had done with cops

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,508
and then built a company around it he

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,270
reached out to some of his friends to

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,829
help build a company out and one of the

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,759
first people he reached out to with his

41
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,829
friend David Meltzer David joined

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,290
tripwire became one of the first

43
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,758
engineers worked for a while when I

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,860
started his own company and then through

45
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,078
a series of acquisitions founded himself

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,870
back at tripwire where he is now

47
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,520
the CTO he has a distinguished career

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,760
working

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,600
at ISS as I said starting internet

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,510
companies working as an engineer in the

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,269
security space and now as CTO of

52
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,459
tripwire is responsible for a number of

53
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,980
issues with technology vision and

54
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:47,320
speaking to the public including us here

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:47,320
today please welcome David Meltzer okay

56
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:05,100
okay can into the mic on excellent we

57
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,010
can see the projector all right we're

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,170
ready to go so this is actually a little

59
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,019
awkward because of what staff just said

60
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,910
I didn't realize that there was someone

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,130
from Syracuse University here because I

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,590
grew up in Syracuse and as a high school

63
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,090
student one of the first things that I

64
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,180
got interested in doing with getting

65
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,200
access to Sun OS systems and if you're

66
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,520
in high school in the early 90s late 80s

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,130
you couldn't go to your high school lab

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,590
you couldn't find a Sun system anywhere

69
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,329
and so the only way that I found to get

70
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,630
one was to go break into the Syracuse

71
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,850
University computers so I apologize for

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,609
that the statue of limitations has long

73
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,090
since expired plus I was a minor so it's

74
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,890
probably okay at this point in time I

75
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,980
did want to kind of get a level set here

76
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,649
of the audience we have obviously the

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,690
founders of tripwire are here and a lot

78
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,220
of students how many of you have

79
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,760
actually used the open-source

80
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,670
tripwire product before and how many

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,200
used it in the 90s at some point okay so

82
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,049
we have got the old school security

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,750
people here and the transition that I'll

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,670
talk about is from what the open source

85
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,858
roots were through to our commercial

86
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,390
product and how it turned into a company

87
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,599
how many of you have ever used the

88
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,300
commercial version of tripwire so we got

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,370
a couple of people but not very many I'm

90
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,040
also going to talk about how tripwire

91
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,080
has evolved and actually has consumed

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,510
some other areas of security in our

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,359
product line as well and some of those

94
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,190
include what was being done at Purdue

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,700
with Dan farmer and coughs how many of

96
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,310
you ever used coughs and then Dan after

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,560
coughs came out with seitan which ended

98
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,720
up competing with what Internet security

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,340
systems did in a commercial product with

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
what was called Internet scanner at the

101
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,500
time how many of you ever used seitan

102
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,200
where we got a few and in internet stana

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,300
in the 90s we had a couple as well so

104
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,479
those are kind of you know the old days

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,300
and as the CTO of tripwire I have some

106
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,520
good special opportunities one of the

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,680
special opportunities I have is

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,590
I'm the number one most frequent flyer

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,710
amongst our 500 or so employees a trip

110
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,448
wire that's not a good thing that's not

111
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,758
the benefit but where I go is often the

112
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,169
benefit and where I go is I go to many

113
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,770
of our customers who are large

114
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:29,490
organizations large enterprises

115
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:31,740
governments states large companies and I

116
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,500
talk to security administrators

117
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,690
directors of security operations chief

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,919
information security officers and I get

119
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,659
to have conversations with them about

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,758
how are they thinking about their

121
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,139
security programs today what are the

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,319
things that they're doing to secure

123
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,729
their environments and then I often dig

124
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,069
into the things that we do at tripwire

125
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,810
like file integrity monitoring and

126
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,180
vulnerability management and we really

127
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,280
dig into the details sometimes I spend

128
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,810
days with these customers saying how are

129
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,448
you implementing and using these

130
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,699
security controls so I've been able to

131
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,940
get a really good perspective amongst

132
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,949
especially large organizations on how

133
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,750
they're building out evolving their

134
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,250
security programs and particularly the

135
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,569
kinds of things that we do at tripwire

136
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,039
and so I'm going to give you a little

137
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,469
bit of a flavor of what that looks like

138
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,060
today one of the other special

139
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:19,949
opportunities I get is to speak at

140
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,750
industry event sometimes because they

141
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,599
like me sometimes it's just because of

142
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,819
my position as CTO of tripwire this is a

143
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,979
great opportunity when I got the

144
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,690
invitation to speak here I jumped on it

145
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,389
instantly because I understand the

146
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,909
history of where tripwire came from and

147
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,289
its roots here at Purdue and so one of

148
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,050
the things that I really want to try and

149
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,509
accomplish in this hour is to give staff

150
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,020
and to give the perview community an

151
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,840
update of where did this open-source

152
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,810
tool that got built 25 years ago turn

153
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,060
into over the period of many decades and

154
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,580
how are people using it and how has it

155
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,250
really become a pillar of the security

156
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,590
ecosystem today and so hopefully I give

157
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,449
you that flavor I also want to give you

158
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,849
an update of what is the state of the

159
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,669
commercial security market today so I'll

160
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,229
share you some statistics about you know

161
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,818
what the commercial world looks like

162
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,409
I'll try and give you some insight as to

163
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,029
how people think about the commercial

164
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,409
security industry and how large

165
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,099
organizations are thinking about

166
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:22,440
security I'm not you know not academic I

167
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,390
did eventually graduate from Carnegie

168
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,510
melon it took me eight years to do it

169
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,510
and so that's how not academic oriented

170
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:33,150
I am but in that middle of that I did

171
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,580
start some companies so I do have a very

172
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,560
good view of how security companies get

173
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,229
started and grow and evolve and

174
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,730
ultimately become mature organizations I

175
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,250
also want to share with you today a

176
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,770
little bit about what isn't working in

177
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,720
security because if you look at the news

178
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,919
if you look at the level of breaches if

179
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,350
you look what's happening

180
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,950
you would have to in some way look back

181
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,320
at these last twenty five years and say

182
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,760
what we're doing isn't working and so I

183
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,140
think we need to take a look at that and

184
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,440
say well why isn't working what's not

185
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,419
working and how can we get better now

186
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,160
obviously in security you know the idea

187
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,800
that security and this is what people

188
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,230
were thinking 20 years ago is if I just

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,660
had that right new tool then I could

190
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,520
secure my organization so it's just I

191
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,260
just don't have that tool yet I got to

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,609
get that next new thing and I think

193
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,830
we've all realized that that's never the

194
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,110
reality it's really about managing risk

195
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,570
it's about lowering your risk and trying

196
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,760
to find that right balance of investment

197
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,460
and actually keeping your systems as

198
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,380
secure as they need to be in finding

199
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,539
those right barriers and borders to put

200
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,099
around them so security has definitely

201
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,110
evolved how people think about security

202
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,479
is evolved I'll try and share some of

203
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,300
that and then I'll finish up by telling

204
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,630
you a few opportunities that I see where

205
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,859
we get to do a little bit of a do-over

206
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,510
we talk about security and cyber

207
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,450
security for the most part people are

208
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,860
talking about IT security but there are

209
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,680
some new opportunities we're going to

210
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,450
have to do this again and I'm seeing it

211
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,910
happen in multiple different areas today

212
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,580
and I think if we can learn from the

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,040
last 25 years of what we got right and

214
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,500
didn't get right in IT security we might

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,730
be able to get a little bit better a

216
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,040
little bit faster

217
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,190
a little bit more secure when we do this

218
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,560
again in some of these new areas so with

219
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,420
that let me jump into a little bit of

220
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,630
the transformation of tripwire over the

221
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,400
last 25 years this is the coast the

222
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,900
paper that came from gene simmons the

223
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,829
founder of tripwire along with staff

224
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,900
from 1993 and talked about the open

225
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,520
source roots of tripwire and what it did

226
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,150
and actually went back and read this

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,880
paper this

228
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:43,260
we just to get a good baseline of what

229
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,060
did it do back then and what I was able

230
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,439
to pull out of the tripwire archives

231
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,449
there are some people at tripwire who've

232
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,530
been there for almost 20 years and I

233
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,810
said you have any really old

234
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,790
presentations and they sent me the

235
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,130
business plan presentation when they

236
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,140
were pitching tripwire to investors and

237
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,570
analysts back in 1998

238
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,020
you can tell it's from 1998 because of

239
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,820
the triangles and the color palette III

240
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,860
I don't think that even exists in

241
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:13,380
PowerPoint anymore but tripwire in 1998

242
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,960
was really pitched as file integrity

243
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,689
assessment or file integrity monitoring

244
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,120
and so this terminology that was created

245
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,190
and generally accepted in security today

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,410
people would call it fin file integrity

247
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,240
monitoring it started as a Spile

248
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,030
integrity assessment it was you know

249
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,040
came out in 1992 recommended by cert got

250
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,870
a lot of downloads I think I first

251
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,849
downloaded tripwire around 1994 probably

252
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,350
because I knew that if I was going to go

253
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,030
break into systems I'd better figure out

254
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,430
how they were going to detect me working

255
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:50,550
into systems and actually I gave a talk

256
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:52,829
back in 1996 96 97 and it was one of the

257
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,349
first talks I ever gave I was a student

258
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,140
I was a security researcher at ISS at

259
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,870
the time and the talk was how to evade

260
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,610
detection by tripwire which I thought

261
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,690
was you know I figured out some of the

262
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,210
things I got to taught the staff a

263
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,610
little bit about it yesterday but it was

264
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,610
really this idea of host-based intrusion

265
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,220
detection if someone makes a change to

266
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,840
your system that's probably where it

267
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,760
went from the state of being in a secure

268
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,140
state to someone did something bad to it

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,060
and if we could detect those changes

270
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,340
then we would be in a much better

271
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,140
position to identify when people were

272
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,030
breaking into the systems and doing

273
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,730
things like adding users or installing

274
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,709
rootkits or making malicious changes to

275
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,060
the server and often people were

276
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,380
deploying this to kind of a couple of

277
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,410
servers that they had around their

278
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,510
organization

279
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,910
the idea of monitoring for file change

280
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,680
is something that has evolved into what

281
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,680
you would call today probably more

282
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,140
anomalous intrusion detection type

283
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,529
capability back in the mid 90s when we

284
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,499
talked

285
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:54,240
the idea of security in this area at ISS

286
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,579
we used to draw a really simple diagram

287
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,430
like a vertical line a horizontal line

288
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,739
and we said on the one hand of security

289
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:04,050
there is trying to identify where the

290
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,180
risks are and you could do that at a

291
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,248
host level or a network level post level

292
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,719
would be things like what cops did the

293
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,970
network level would be what things like

294
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,470
Staton and internet scanner did and then

295
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,170
you could try and find people actually

296
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,759
trying to break into systems and this is

297
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,849
what intrusion detection and the idea of

298
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,699
intrusion detection went back to US Air

299
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,709
Force and like 80 but the idea of doing

300
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,660
it at a network level was a little bit

301
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,998
later on and you could do intrusion

302
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,920
detection at a system level which was

303
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,269
like what tripwire did or you could do

304
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,670
it at a network level that was the

305
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,889
software that I built at ISS called real

306
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,599
secure which was a network IDs and there

307
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,509
were various other network IDs as they

308
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,089
come out around late 80s and into the

309
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,680
90s it started in the 90s it started to

310
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,809
get commercial acceptance and people

311
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,939
started to buy these products from

312
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,439
somebody's like ISS and tripwire and

313
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,509
there are other companies like the wheel

314
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:57,480
group and accent who are around back in

315
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,009
that period of time so we're looking for

316
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,459
files we're looking for anomalies in the

317
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:05,309
files and that was basically the idea so

318
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,619
let me fast forward now about 25 years

319
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:10,290
and talk about why are people using file

320
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,149
integrity monitoring today and really

321
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,370
there's four reasons and you can see how

322
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:16,050
its kind of evolved from we want to just

323
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,180
look for file changes because that means

324
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,459
something's bad happened well there's

325
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,529
really the four reasons is first the

326
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,290
primary reason people are deploying file

327
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:28,199
integrity monitoring is not to look for

328
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,360
bad people doing bad things anymore

329
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,910
the number-one reason is they're looking

330
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,639
for good people making unauthorized

331
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,439
changes to systems and it turns out that

332
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,290
this is a really critical part of

333
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:43,319
reducing the attack surface of your

334
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,319
servers is to know is someone taking a

335
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:48,149
system that was in a well-known secure

336
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,620
configured state and they're making

337
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:51,749
changes they shouldn't make to it and

338
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,699
generally this is system administrators

339
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:56,360
who are going outside of an established

340
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,769
change control process and they're

341
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,639
reconfiguring the system on-the-fly this

342
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,820
happens all the time

343
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,500
every day across any large organization

344
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,170
so if you can keep your system in a

345
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,510
secure state then you'll have a better

346
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,729
chance of preventing people from being

347
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,860
able to break into it so it turns from a

348
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,270
reactive type of control where we're

349
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,550
looking for attackers trying to do bad

350
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,110
things into a more proactive type of

351
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,910
control where we're trying to prevent

352
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,580
people from getting the system into a

353
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,990
state where it could be broken into the

354
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,420
second use case is really the same thing

355
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,430
as it was the original idea of trip wire

356
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,229
was which is identifying someone

357
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,020
maliciously doing something to the

358
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,490
system now how people will do malicious

359
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,680
things the system's has changed over

360
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,840
time and so the way that you need to

361
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,579
detect those things has also changed but

362
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,860
identifying malicious change is one of

363
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,110
those key use cases the third thing that

364
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,910
we often see is actually sometimes

365
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,100
people use this file integrity

366
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,319
monitoring type of control not for

367
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,460
security at all they bake it into what

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,280
they would call their IT operations

369
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,960
process which is they have something

370
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,939
where if someone wants to make a change

371
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,590
to a system they have to open a trouble

372
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,060
ticket if you go to a large company

373
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,520
those tickets go to a change control

374
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,290
board the change Control Board reviews

375
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,730
the change approves the change the

376
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,620
change then gets pushed out into

377
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,230
production and people use trip wire

378
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,970
across many large companies to be the

379
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,890
system that tells you what actually

380
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,750
happened to the server so we had this

381
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,569
whole process that tells you what should

382
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,220
happen to the server but then you have

383
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,810
this gap where nobody knows if they

384
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,640
actually implemented what they said they

385
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,020
were going to do and so people use trip

386
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,990
wire for that detective control

387
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,720
capability and then the fourth reason

388
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,660
which actually is I would characterize

389
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,510
it as people smarter than me said you

390
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,270
should use trip wire which is every

391
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:44,250
compliance regulation every security

392
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,800
standard that has been written in the

393
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,140
last decade says you need to be doing

394
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,260
something about monitoring your critical

395
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,960
systems for their integrity and you know

396
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,210
this comes back to 25 years ago

397
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,950
you know staff and Jean wrote a paper

398
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,590
around why it was so important to

399
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,870
monitor servers and systems for

400
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,330
integrity and the value of that

401
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,680
monitoring and eventually people who

402
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,600
were writing standards said they're

403
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,280
right we probably should tell people

404
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,150
that this is a really important thing to

405
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:18,160
do and they did and this is primarily

406
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,350
the reason why today file integrity

407
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,180
monitoring is considered a what we would

408
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,060
call a foundational security control

409
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,430
which is no matter who's trying to

410
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,069
attack you no matter what organization

411
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,630
what your adversary is whether you're

412
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,210
worried about crime cyber crime

413
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,880
syndicates whether you're worried about

414
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,310
nation-state actors or activists no

415
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,160
matter what you care about you need to

416
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,380
do the basics of security right to have

417
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,540
an effective security program and so

418
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,189
whether you're looking at things like

419
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,620
the Center for Internet Security's

420
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,420
critical security controls or the NIST

421
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,240
cybersecurity framework the PCI

422
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,430
standards ISO standards all of these

423
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,140
standards are greatly overlapping they

424
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,540
90 percent all say the same thing and

425
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,160
every single one of them says you need

426
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,928
to do integrity monitoring on your

427
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,420
critical systems if you want to have an

428
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,670
effective security program and that

429
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,890
really has been what has driven the

430
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,890
success of tripwire as a company for

431
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,990
many decades which is we started with

432
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,510
this idea of integrity monitoring would

433
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,699
be an important security control it got

434
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,309
baked into all of these standards and

435
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,350
regulations to say yes we all believe

436
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,359
this is a very critical security control

437
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,980
and now any large organization that

438
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,100
wants to build out a security program

439
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,010
generally what they're doing is well

440
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,780
what they often do is they have a SISO

441
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,030
or they have some smart security people

442
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,309
who say I know how we want to implement

443
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,080
the security program now if they're

444
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,490
smart generally what they're going to do

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,470
is say I'm not going to try and create

446
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,059
this from scratch I'm going to use some

447
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,220
accepted standards that are already out

448
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,809
there and I'm going to evaluate the

449
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,340
current state of my security program

450
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,690
against that and then we're going to

451
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,669
figure out where can we evolve and

452
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,830
improve our program and so no matter

453
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,929
which they choose to base their security

454
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,178
programs on and we're increasingly

455
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,410
seeing adoption in the commercial space

456
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,720
around like the NIST cybersecurity

457
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,970
framework but a lot of companies are

458
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,460
using the CIS critical security controls

459
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,690
as well we're seeing people that decide

460
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:19,540
they're going to adopt these kind of

461
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,820
standards now back in 1997 when tripwire

462
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,159
got started there were and I don't have

463
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,139
a good number but there were a handful

464
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,929
maybe dozens of security companies out

465
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,860
there most of them pretty small tripwire

466
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:31,960
within the Moore

467
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,729
that they were ironically competing at

468
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,920
that point against internet security

469
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,470
systems which is where I worked and at

470
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,540
that point in time ISS was really the

471
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,250
leader around this internet scanning a

472
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,840
vulnerability assessment intrusion

473
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,130
detection side there were this other

474
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,070
company accent that was pretty

475
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,080
good-sized as well and tripwire was

476
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,178
using in their brochure in their

477
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,240
marketing materials to their investors

478
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:57,040
look how successful ISS could be and now

479
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,170
here I am you know 20 years later I'm

480
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,570
back at tripwire from where I was at ISS

481
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,490
at the time so a little bit of the

482
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,790
corporate history of how tripwires is

483
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,070
now evolved over those many years

484
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:12,129
founded in 97 released the tripwire

485
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:16,720
enterprise product which was our multi

486
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,160
server managed system in 2005 company

487
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,220
made a couple of acquisitions that's

488
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,230
actually how I ended up at tripwire I

489
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,260
started a company back in 2002 it got

490
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,090
acquired in 2007 by another company and

491
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,590
circle where I became the CTO and then

492
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,770
that company got acquired by tripwire

493
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,928
back in 2013 so I've been at tripwire

494
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,370
since 2013 I was actually competing

495
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:39,549
against tripwire before that in the

496
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:43,149
market for some part of the last 15

497
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:45,040
years before that and then tripwire from

498
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,260
a corporate entity perspective got

499
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,960
acquired by a private equity firm and

500
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,660
then subsequently got acquired by a

501
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,910
larger organization called Belden about

502
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,830
two and a half years ago so tripwires

503
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,169
run as an independent business within

504
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,820
Belden which is a larger company thought

505
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:03,400
I'd just give you a little bit of color

506
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,840
of who owns tripwire today Belden

507
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,030
publicly traded company it's about a

508
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,399
hundred years old company has

509
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,100
headquarters in st. Louis Missouri

510
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,200
offices in Indianapolis as well as

511
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,719
Richmond as well as a number of places

512
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,480
around the world tripwires headquarters

513
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,910
in Portland Oregon I'm based in Atlanta

514
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,010
which is coming out of the ISS roots

515
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,660
when I moved down there to go work for

516
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:30,280
my friend back in the 90s Belden makes

517
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,169
Ethernet cable a hundred years ago they

518
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,450
were making copper wire one of their

519
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,730
customers was Thomas Edison and they

520
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,380
moved from making wire to cable to

521
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,710
ultimately making networking equipment

522
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,750
for industrial markets and so the first

523
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,450
ethernet cable ever made in the world

524
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,000
from Belden the first cable TV

525
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,980
transmission came from Belden equipment

526
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,980
the first Ethernet switch on a

527
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,020
manufacturing floor came from Belden and

528
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:00,070
so this is a company that has seen this

529
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,980
transformation from proprietary systems

530
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,659
to standard IP based systems not for a

531
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,720
couple of years but over a period of

532
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,960
many decades and has recognized the

533
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,340
value and importance of security as

534
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,250
Industries make this transformation to

535
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,409
IP and they saw this transformation

536
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,000
happening not on the IT side but within

537
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,790
the industrial markets within the

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,890
broadcast markets and wanted to find a

539
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,260
company that could help them with their

540
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,640
customers making that transformation so

541
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,940
I'll talk more about how that applies to

542
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,670
tripwire as we go through it today

543
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,220
tripwire half of the fortune 500 are

544
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,280
tripwires customers across a wide

545
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,560
segment I did some research around the

546
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,700
biggest cyber security companies in the

547
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:49,270
world and by two financial metrics one

548
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,330
earnings or EBIT uh I couldn't find 20

549
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,040
companies in the world in cyber security

550
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,870
that have as much IVA does tripwire and

551
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,820
I couldn't find 40 companies in the

552
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,189
world that have as much revenue as

553
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,230
tripwire today so it really is one of

554
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,480
the largest premiere cybersecurity

555
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,720
companies in the world and it has

556
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,070
evolved itself over time which you know

557
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,570
something that I coming from it's

558
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,639
open-source roots I think everyone who

559
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,550
is involved in it 20 25 years ago should

560
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,740
be very proud of as we talked about

561
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,530
tripwire today we're the leader in

562
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,960
policy and compliance so we serve three

563
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,540
different customers within large

564
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,150
enterprises security teams operations

565
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,620
teams and compliance teams for security

566
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,420
teams we detect changes that are

567
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,030
happening in their organization on their

568
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,040
critical systems and we identify when

569
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,320
those changes create new risks to the

570
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,420
organization for compliance teams we

571
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,790
help automate and reduce the burden of

572
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,370
complying with standards like PCI or

573
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,850
HIPAA or sarbanes-oxley and things like

574
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,610
that

575
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,350
noggin in the utility market because we

576
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,850
can provide many of those detective

577
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,560
controls and then provide all the

578
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,419
reporting and auditing that's needed for

579
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,010
that and then with the operations team

580
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,400
we help validate what changes are

581
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,480
happening

582
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,770
for the organization so now let me talk

583
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,540
a little bit about how tripwire has

584
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,570
changed over these many years

585
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,760
tripwire 20 years ago was file integrity

586
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,800
monitoring over the years we've added

587
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,900
additional capability around security

588
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,840
configuration management vulnerability

589
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:21,550
management and log management so we have

590
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,709
a broader product suite and what file

591
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,379
integrity monitoring is has really

592
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,240
evolved over these many years as well so

593
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,910
slide from 1998

594
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,260
tripwire is actually being used by real

595
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,080
customers

596
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,900
it was tripwire was running on all 10

597
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,310
servers that the company had this was

598
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,320
probably a decent sized company at the

599
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,540
time three of these machines were

600
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,120
compromised and we were able to detect

601
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,460
those compromised systems through seeing

602
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,979
the files that changed on the system so

603
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,390
that was often the scale that we were

604
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,990
dealing with at tripwire

605
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,670
back in the late 90s today the scale of

606
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,310
where our customers are using our

607
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,100
products is orders and orders of

608
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:06,840
magnitude higher so we have retailers

609
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:10,120
that use our product on 285,000 assets

610
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,230
we have a government agency that's using

611
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,719
our product on 850,000 assets we have

612
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,220
insurance companies using it on 45,000

613
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,530
assets and just kind of give you a

614
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,210
sampling of the kind of problem that

615
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,860
you're trying to solve when you're

616
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,010
talking about organizations that are

617
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,750
trying to find change and identify

618
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,670
important security issues that are

619
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,070
happening when I'm looking at it for

620
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,170
tens and hundreds of thousands of assets

621
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,560
versus I'm looking at it on 10 systems

622
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,880
is a very different kind of problem

623
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,980
because very quickly we've moved from

624
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,780
this issue of we had too little

625
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,930
visibility into what was happening

626
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,960
before anyone had open source tripwire

627
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,420
you would probably manually go do you

628
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,100
know in LS or a find you do something on

629
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,180
your UNIX system to try and figure out

630
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,120
did anything change

631
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,470
so we first first versions of tripwire

632
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,629
we're really good at giving you that

633
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,900
visibility so now I knew something

634
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,640
changed but for a large organization

635
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,250
knowing something changed is no longer

636
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,110
the issue now the problem people have is

637
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,259
I have

638
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,850
say 50,000 servers and there were 200

639
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:18,070
changes that happened today on each one

640
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,908
of those servers at a file level and so

641
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,499
I'm dealing with

642
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,649
there's a million changes that I have a

643
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:25,570
day and now I'm trying to pick out did

644
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,820
one of those changes actually happen to

645
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,619
be malicious did one of those changes

646
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,850
happen to be the unauthorized change

647
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,980
that shouldn't have happened in the

648
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,769
system did one of those changes create a

649
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,840
new risk to the organization and so it

650
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:40,330
turns from a visibility issue of trying

651
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,759
to collect the data to an analytics

652
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,350
issue of trying to sort through all of

653
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,480
this data and figure out what's really

654
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,459
important and that's really one of the

655
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,889
things that has evolved for phim over

656
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,019
the course of many years one of the

657
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:54,508
things that has really changed for the

658
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:58,359
film market is this idea of dynamic

659
00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:00,759
reconciliation which is not every change

660
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,460
that happens on a system it's something

661
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,249
that actually you want to have someone

662
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,230
human pay attention to in fact almost

663
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:10,629
every change that happens to a system it

664
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,179
turns out is perfectly normal acceptable

665
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:15,309
business as usual but unless you can

666
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,019
filter down and pick out the one change

667
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,700
that isn't that you have a very

668
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:21,039
difficult time getting value out of it

669
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,169
in the original tripwire you would do

670
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,239
that generally by configuring what files

671
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:27,100
you wanted to monitor so you're going to

672
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:29,980
monitor your system binaries and your

673
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,379
user files in your password file but

674
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,999
over time what that is changing into is

675
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:36,039
well your binary is change every time

676
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:38,590
you do a patch update so what you really

677
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,230
want to know is did the binary change in

678
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,600
the way that my UNIX provider shipped

679
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,340
out the files to so can I match up the

680
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,738
change to what was supposed to happen if

681
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,259
I did a patch update or did someone

682
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,480
insert a binary into that system that

683
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:54,639
was not supposed to be there and so all

684
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,029
this idea of dynamic reconciliation is

685
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:59,649
we need to do a lot of things in them to

686
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,200
be able to figure out was it's something

687
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:04,330
that was authorized unauthorized

688
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,220
malicious or benign when it was

689
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,428
happening and we've done a lot of work

690
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,320
at that around tripwire another thing

691
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:15,580
that changed was the visualization so

692
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,369
here's a put from circa nineteen mid-90s

693
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:22,149
output of tripwire detecting that a file

694
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:23,559
changed on the system and here's

695
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,459
something from our current reporting

696
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,310
platform

697
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,930
that shows the again versus you can

698
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,940
still dig down and see that single file

699
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,650
change in what changed on it but very

700
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,930
often people start with this level of

701
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,060
okay how many thousands of changes were

702
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,470
happening across my systems at time you

703
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,540
can I start to pick out what would be

704
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,420
anomalous changes across that broad set

705
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,000
of information

706
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,490
another thing that changed is the idea

707
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,980
of files being the part that we want to

708
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,080
focus on for integrity has drastically

709
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,910
altered for every large organization so

710
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,889
we often still call it file integrity

711
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,330
monitoring but when we talk about that

712
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,830
it's really monitoring all the

713
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,710
configuration attributes of the system

714
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,510
so your database servers your Active

715
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,580
Directory servers your firewalls your

716
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,620
router switches systems that are running

717
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,810
in the cloud application information

718
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,629
that's running so the idea that it's

719
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,060
just files is something that's very much

720
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,830
evolved over time and stripped wire has

721
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,720
advanced quite a lot in monitoring a

722
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,399
broad set of different kinds of systems

723
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,960
so a little bit of what's changing with

724
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,490
tripwire now let me tell you what's

725
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,440
change from having a couple dozen

726
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,570
security companies to what security

727
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,620
looks like from a commercial security

728
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,450
market perspective in 2017 if you're a

729
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,830
large organization and you want to look

730
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,950
at what are the different security

731
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,189
products I need to buy in implement to

732
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:47,200
have a secure organization there are

733
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,940
about 60 different categories of

734
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,760
security products out there I need to

735
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,770
deal with so you don't want to talk to a

736
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,200
chief information security officer about

737
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,690
their security program they probably

738
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,340
have at least 60 different products and

739
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,890
there are products that cover more than

740
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,720
one of these areas and there are vendors

741
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,270
that cover more than one of these areas

742
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,110
but it's very typical to find large

743
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,700
organizations that have 10 20 50 80

744
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,169
different security companies that

745
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,830
they're buying products from at any

746
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:20,530
given point in time I did an analysis

747
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,909
because one of the things I do as CTO is

748
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,399
a business development and corporate

749
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,590
development for the company of how many

750
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,090
security companies are out there and

751
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,070
actually made a spreadsheet and got some

752
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,520
links and categorized them it was a big

753
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,040
endeavor and I came up with 1641

754
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,410
security companies and I'm pretty

755
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,940
confident I didn't capture all of them

756
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,730
so the number is definitely higher than

757
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,720
that there's at least 1,000 641 security

758
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,280
companies out there I did some analysis

759
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,620
of the data that I collected when I did

760
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,500
this and this is not categories this is

761
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,719
have the word in their name so there are

762
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,120
51 something network or network

763
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,180
something companies out there and 34

764
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,280
threats something companies out there

765
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:05,860
33 clouds something 7 fire something's

766
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,250
there was a couple years where fire was

767
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,139
a really popular word colors are also

768
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,660
really popular in security company names

769
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,730
and red is the most popular color if you

770
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,710
wanted to start a security company blue

771
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,230
next black is a little one there's only

772
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,310
one orange security company out there so

773
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,200
I kind of went through all this I said

774
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,720
ok if you want to build a new security

775
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,780
company I saw some good whiteboard

776
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,020
posters yesterday you want to call it

777
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,460
like red cloud threat Network that's

778
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,410
perfect name for your security company

779
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,710
but be the most people be like I think

780
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,480
I've heard of you guys now if you go

781
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,950
back to those categories and look at how

782
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,330
many different security companies are in

783
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,610
each one of these categories there's a

784
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:48,040
117 startups that are focused around

785
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,780
mobile security today there's a hundred

786
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,540
and twelve security companies focused on

787
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,600
encryption there are 72 focused around

788
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,790
the area of threat intelligence so the

789
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,969
amount of companies that are out there

790
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:03,120
in very early stage more than 90% of

791
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,610
these 1600 companies are losing money

792
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,649
and the great majority are in probably a

793
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,649
stage where they've been venture funded

794
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,670
they've gotten a handful of customers

795
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,410
typical company I talked to at the

796
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,270
startup stage raised a couple million

797
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,620
dollars handful of customers may be

798
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,260
doing a million or two million in

799
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,300
revenue and they need to find some way

800
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,890
to pivot into turning into a more mature

801
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,350
organization over the next couple years

802
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,930
or hopefully get acquired by someone

803
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,939
else so they don't have to and for a

804
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,100
large organization who's now buying

805
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,080
security products this is a very

806
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,810
difficult ecosystem to navigate through

807
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,689
because the number of companies that are

808
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:43,600
calling and the large organization on a

809
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,830
daily basis is staggering and the number

810
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,510
of those companies out there that are

811
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,000
going to be in the same business selling

812
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,400
the same products 10 years from now is a

813
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,059
very small minority and so this makes a

814
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,320
really difficult

815
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,619
challenged because it's a really moving

816
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,599
target of acquiring security products so

817
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:00,639
if you look at tripwire we kind of put

818
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:02,229
ourselves into this bucket there's a

819
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,029
category of security that's evolved to

820
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:06,999
be called security and vulnerability

821
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,769
management sub segments of that include

822
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:10,779
an area called policy compliance and

823
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,729
another one called device vulnerability

824
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:14,889
assessment and we talk about where does

825
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:17,440
file integrity monitoring now fit today

826
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:20,139
amongst the 60 categories of security

827
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,629
that analysts like Gartner and IDC would

828
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:25,269
place things in to IDC would say them is

829
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:27,099
part of the policy compliance market and

830
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,869
tripwire is now one of the leaders in

831
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,039
the overall SVM in particularly that

832
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:34,209
policy compliance market that we play in

833
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,339
so hopefully give you a little bit of

834
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,339
flavor for how crowded the overall

835
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:42,369
security industry is and how unique it

836
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:44,200
is to have created something here 25

837
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:47,529
years ago that has become one of those

838
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,450
top 20 of thousands of companies that

839
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:52,049
have started since then and have not

840
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:55,059
reached that level of success scale or

841
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:58,239
particularly a long term sustainable

842
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:00,399
profitable business which is what

843
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,320
tripwire is today and which very few

844
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,609
companies in the security world actually

845
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,320
are so let me now talk about what's

846
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,359
happening today in security that's

847
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,759
actually going to transform what

848
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,369
tripwire is for the next five and 10

849
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:18,580
years because what we're doing today is

850
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:20,738
not going to keep working if we don't

851
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,879
continue to evolve as a company we don't

852
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:24,489
continue to evolve

853
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:27,399
what integrity monitoring means to

854
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:28,809
organizations and the kind of things

855
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:31,928
that we need to be able to do to help

856
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:33,129
secure those environments so first thing

857
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,940
I want to talk about and this is going

858
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,468
to be you know

859
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,139
motherhood and apple pie to everyone

860
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:40,479
here explosive growth in the number of

861
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:42,699
assets that are IP connected out there

862
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:44,889
in the world so back in the 90s we were

863
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,009
talking about there's a couple of

864
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:49,508
million devices that are IP connected

865
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:51,219
and that evolved to half a billion and

866
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:53,469
that's now going to be 50 billion in a

867
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:56,049
couple years and this goes to this scale

868
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:58,239
problem that people are facing all over

869
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:00,639
the security world and you talk to large

870
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:03,190
organizations it's not just their IT

871
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,839
servers but now I have everything from

872
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,820
smart lights that are getting connected

873
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,880
the Internet

874
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,199
things kind of devices the smart you

875
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,390
know smart homes are getting connected

876
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,639
all of these things are creating new

877
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,870
connectivity new kinds of risks and it's

878
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,540
going to require a different kind of

879
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,250
thinking around security challenges

880
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,570
everyone knows security breaches are

881
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,969
continuing to soar not going to spend

882
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:27,330
much time on that the skills gap is

883
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:29,699
something for us as a industry is very

884
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,219
concerning to how it's going to impact

885
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,350
how our products need to work how we

886
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,870
offer our products and services to our

887
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,600
customers and what this is going to mean

888
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,179
for security going forward if you're a

889
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,819
student and you're in the security area

890
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,560
today you will have no problem at all

891
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,510
finding a job for many years to come so

892
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,299
you chose a good chose a good industry

893
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:54,060
to get into but from a product

894
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,190
perspective what would I often see when

895
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,020
I look at very early stage prototypes or

896
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,570
people come up with new ideas for

897
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,700
security products or a new idea for a

898
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,500
security concept if you're creating

899
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,020
something that you're going to

900
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,600
incremental II improve the security for

901
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,540
a large organization but it's going to

902
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,740
require any amount of effort for them to

903
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:19,170
deploy install operate and manage that

904
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,779
new security solution you haven't helped

905
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,310
them at all you theoretically believe

906
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,990
you created something that has helped

907
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,480
improve the security or could improve

908
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,970
the security of the company but security

909
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,820
organizations they can't find people to

910
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,109
hire to operate your product they don't

911
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,420
have enough people to operate the

912
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,280
products they have and what they

913
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,790
generally are trying to accomplish today

914
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,340
is to consolidate down to fewer products

915
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,410
that have lower operational cost so that

916
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,450
I can more effectively manage the

917
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,509
increasing scale of the number of

918
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,549
systems I need to secure so when you

919
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,140
think about innovation and what are the

920
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,210
kind of problems that you could solve in

921
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,670
security today that would be really

922
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,550
interesting to large companies it's

923
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,620
things that would incrementally improve

924
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:07,050
security but it actually has to reduce

925
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,270
how much time they have to spend it

926
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,670
actually has to be more automated it has

927
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,800
to eliminate manual process they have to

928
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,120
go through today and in many ways this

929
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,670
is the challenge of file integrity

930
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,850
monitoring for large organizations which

931
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,430
is

932
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,770
things that produce data are challenging

933
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,290
for companies because now I need someone

934
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,420
to look at the data and so all of our

935
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:31,450
focus at tripwire because of this skills

936
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,340
gap is how can we automate our products

937
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,410
how can we reduce how much time it takes

938
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,020
to operate the product how can we make

939
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,670
it easier for someone to deploy operate

940
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,440
and manage these kind of solutions and

941
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,880
that's what companies across the

942
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,610
security industry are trying to

943
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,290
accomplish today and so it's not that we

944
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,660
don't need more ways to secure

945
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:52,150
organizations we need new security ideas

946
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,870
and innovation but that's the mindset

947
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:58,060
you find in many large companies the

948
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,890
cloud I'm sure everyone is you know

949
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,150
everyone's very familiar with the

950
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,940
transformation to the cloud that's

951
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,680
happening 20% of the compute power in

952
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,080
the world today is already in the cloud

953
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,870
and it's growing 50 percent over the

954
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,779
next 10 years so for a large enterprise

955
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,230
the future for the next 5 to 10 years is

956
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,730
what I would characterize as a hybrid

957
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,410
organization I want to say hybrid it

958
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,790
means if you're a large company you're

959
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,540
going to have a combination of physical

960
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:27,220
servers virtualization private cloud and

961
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,860
public cloud environments you have to

962
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,060
secure and so the cloud hasn't actually

963
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,040
made the challenge of securing that

964
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,200
environment any easier it's just given

965
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,910
me one more thing to secure because

966
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,160
although companies are migrating

967
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,560
applications into the cloud it's going

968
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,600
to be for most companies many many years

969
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,980
before they actually get rid of all of

970
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,839
their physical servers and

971
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,750
virtualization that already exists and

972
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,630
so they're looking for solutions that

973
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,010
can cover this broad set of private and

974
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,290
public cloud infrastructure they have

975
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,510
and the idea of Finn has to be

976
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,910
reinvented for this architecture as well

977
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,530
if people take a Linux server and it

978
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,779
used to be 20 years ago it was a

979
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,270
physical server running on some you know

980
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,860
direct CPU and then it you know ran on

981
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,259
virtualization now it's running on then

982
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,940
or it's running on VMware and then they

983
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,190
took it and they moved it to Amazon or

984
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,020
Azure and they put it in ec2 and now

985
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,540
it's a Linux system that's a pretty easy

986
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,280
thing to secure because it's basically

987
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,350
the same thing as it used to be it's

988
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,050
just running somewhere else that's easy

989
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,700
what becomes really difficult is when

990
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,230
people are adopting cloud technology

991
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,149
they're not just doing it at that

992
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,280
infrastructure layer they're writing

993
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,220
applications in

994
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,650
entirely new way so instead of having a

995
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,250
Linux system I'm writing C code on and

996
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,740
compiling and I'm executing now I am

997
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,680
writing it in an Amazon environment I'm

998
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,979
using s3 object storage to store all of

999
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,770
my files I'm using maybe redshift as a

1000
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,260
database to store you know relational

1001
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:58,290
data into I'm using their lambda service

1002
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,910
to actually do compute power and so now

1003
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,770
I take the idea of okay well I want to

1004
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,020
do integrity monitoring on the files and

1005
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,910
the traditional way tripwire would work

1006
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,710
would say okay just tell me where the

1007
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,759
Linux system is and I'll go put my agent

1008
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,220
on it and then we'll monitor the

1009
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,170
filesystem and the conversation back

1010
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,359
from the IT team is there is no

1011
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,730
operating system there is no file system

1012
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,220
so I do want to monitor integrity but

1013
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,280
where and the answer to where is it's

1014
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,810
where the data is living it's in the s3

1015
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,000
object storage that I want to do

1016
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,310
integrity monitoring but it's no longer

1017
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,080
a file system so this is really changing

1018
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,730
how we're thinking about how will we

1019
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,200
secure the future of applications a

1020
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:39,600
tripwire as well DevOps is another thing

1021
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,419
that's really transforming how IT

1022
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,339
organizations are operating today and

1023
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,370
pulled out a quote from Jean Kim our

1024
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,620
founder unrelated to tripwire where they

1025
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,870
call it DevOps but it's really it's dev

1026
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,569
its ops it's QA its test and it's

1027
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,299
security all in one that you're trying

1028
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,190
to put together I go out and I talk to

1029
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,080
organizations about their DevOps process

1030
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,000
generally what they're trying to

1031
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,590
accomplish as a high-level is you know

1032
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,630
more effective application development

1033
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,940
and rollout but what this means in

1034
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,610
practice is very often they're using

1035
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,370
deployment tools to take a system image

1036
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:17,220
and instead of pushing a new image into

1037
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,290
production once and then changes happen

1038
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,850
at the production level on those systems

1039
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,460
now what they're doing is they're going

1040
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,900
back to their development systems making

1041
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,060
a configuration change in the

1042
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,280
development system and then they

1043
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,070
actually delete the production system

1044
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,950
they do a new rollout of systems from

1045
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:37,140
dev to test to prod and now the new

1046
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,640
system replaces the old system so you

1047
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,770
think about this from a traditional file

1048
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,150
integrity monitoring approach we were

1049
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,850
sitting on this production server

1050
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,020
looking for changes to it well now no

1051
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,460
change has ever happened to the

1052
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,650
production server at a configuration

1053
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,030
level there's activity that happens but

1054
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,640
at the configuration level the system

1055
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:56,940
static and then what we see is the

1056
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,799
system gets destroyed a new system gets

1057
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,690
stood up and it turns out these two

1058
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,900
systems are like one configuration item

1059
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:06,000
apart so we still want to monitor this

1060
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,380
whole environment for integrity but the

1061
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,870
idea that we could do it at a filesystem

1062
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,450
level on a single system is no longer

1063
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,460
applicable we need to be monitoring the

1064
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,770
complete deployment rollout State and be

1065
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,910
able to associate this system replaced

1066
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,290
that system and this was the

1067
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,450
configuration change that happened

1068
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,009
between them so it's really changed how

1069
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:26,029
we need to be thinking about integrity

1070
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:29,280
monitoring from a security approach

1071
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,260
docker docker and more broadly the

1072
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,540
containerization that we're seeing

1073
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:38,250
companies adopt doctor a year ago I go

1074
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,020
out to customers every week talk to a

1075
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,810
lot of them not a single customer had

1076
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,640
ever asked me about docker and this year

1077
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,560
and really for the last six nine months

1078
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,330
I haven't gone to a single customer of

1079
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,509
ours that doesn't ask me what do I do

1080
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,549
about docker it's gotten huge adoption

1081
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,410
over the last year in the IT world and

1082
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,930
it's application developers who are

1083
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,480
building these containers in these micro

1084
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,850
instances of applications and system

1085
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,620
components and here's the challenge for

1086
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,839
you go back to traditional security

1087
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,339
controls if you're sitting at the base

1088
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,920
operating system-level

1089
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,350
and looking for change what happens is

1090
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,510
now someone's building their application

1091
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,980
with 50 different containers that's

1092
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,900
sitting on top of your Linux operating

1093
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,180
system within their doctor environment

1094
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,600
and you're not able to get visibility

1095
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,730
into any individual container because

1096
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,230
they're all basically hidden from the

1097
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,570
base operating system if you're only

1098
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,040
looking at base file system changes so

1099
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,440
you need to figure out well how do we

1100
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,660
approach this the idea of installing an

1101
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,910
agent on 50 containers is a very

1102
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,250
difficult challenge the idea that as

1103
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,460
people build containers what they often

1104
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,430
do is they'll take the elastic capacity

1105
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,040
of docker and say I'm going to stand up

1106
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,230
50 identical containers to do some

1107
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,940
amount of processing right now for 30

1108
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,700
seconds and then I'm going to go destroy

1109
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,920
that container so if you were to monitor

1110
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,149
that from an integrity perspective you

1111
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,770
would just see these containers

1112
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,390
you know standing up and disappearing

1113
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:06,150
all the time all over your environment

1114
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,730
and very rarely would anything change

1115
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:11,340
within them and so we need a new model

1116
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,770
of how are we going to monitor assess

1117
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,110
for change within a docker container and

1118
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,030
with in containers in general so that we

1119
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:20,220
can maintain the integrity monitoring of

1120
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,750
those systems and do it without having

1121
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,430
to install things within the container

1122
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,380
because they're too small for that and

1123
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,910
do things that can associate multiple

1124
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,890
containers that are really the same

1125
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,210
system with each other and people are

1126
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,100
trying to solve this problem by doing

1127
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,260
things like integrating back to

1128
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,960
container repositories integrating back

1129
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,180
to other systems that hold the static

1130
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,010
containers versus trying to do this all

1131
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,560
on a runtime basis when the container

1132
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,970
first stands up the original some of the

1133
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,830
original blaze people were using the

1134
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:49,200
open source tripwire was I'm going to

1135
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,270
scan for files once a day well when you

1136
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,069
live in a world where virtual systems

1137
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,770
cloud systems and containers might only

1138
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,690
live for 30 seconds at a time the idea

1139
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,370
that I could do a daily assessment for

1140
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:02,400
change is no longer really in applicable

1141
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:04,259
model so already we have things that do

1142
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,910
real-time change monitoring and giving

1143
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,590
you instant visibility into what's

1144
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,540
happening but we do really need to

1145
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,400
continue to look at how do we change our

1146
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,779
model for this so just to finish up here

1147
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,420
let me tell you a little a few areas

1148
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,980
where I think we've gotten it wrong

1149
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,190
phishing is a great example how many of

1150
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,610
you have to take or have taken some kind

1151
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,530
of security awareness training security

1152
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,880
awareness is a big area in fact there's

1153
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,320
a lot probably a lot of research that

1154
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,690
says security awareness is one of the

1155
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,640
easiest lowest cost best impact things

1156
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,490
you can do to improve the security of an

1157
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,350
organization and I believe that part of

1158
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,089
security training today is often one of

1159
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,130
the prime things they tell people and we

1160
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,290
do that trip water to is don't open

1161
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,790
attachments from the wrong people how

1162
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,690
many people have heard that before

1163
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,700
yep okay so so I was actually in a

1164
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,050
conference in Australia and I heard a

1165
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,850
guy from the UK

1166
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,130
talk about this I thought was a really

1167
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,720
good example here's my email address

1168
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:04,290
feel free to email me if you have any

1169
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,899
questions here's the email header when I

1170
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,090
send an email and what I would like to

1171
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,280
know from the audience is how many of

1172
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,470
you could tell me whether this email

1173
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,580
header is legitimately came from

1174
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,839
that email address or not you could it

1175
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,799
would take you it take you a little bit

1176
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,910
of time most people are not capable of

1177
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,859
deciphering whether an email

1178
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,560
legitimately came from the right address

1179
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:29,970
that it was sent from if you dig into it

1180
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,040
a little more and you look at exactly

1181
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,990
some of these received some headers you

1182
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,279
get a little bit better indication most

1183
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,368
of you probably don't look at the email

1184
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,740
headers for every email that you receive

1185
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:42,630
so this is just an example of what's

1186
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,729
really like we're trying to solve the

1187
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,040
problem of phishing by telling people

1188
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:49,619
don't open the wrong attachments when in

1189
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,029
reality nobody is capable of making an

1190
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,090
assessment whether the attachment is

1191
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:56,609
from a legitimate person or not and this

1192
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,840
is an example of where security I feel

1193
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,330
like not working

1194
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,470
antivirus another area that security is

1195
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,230
really not working today

1196
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:07,560
average antivirus product can detect

1197
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,330
within the first hour of a new virus or

1198
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,430
a piece of malware being released only

1199
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,560
detects it about 30 percent within a

1200
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,569
month it has about 93 percent detection

1201
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,609
and this is a good example of why

1202
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:21,089
traditional antivirus tools are not

1203
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:22,650
effective because these systems are

1204
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:24,869
getting morphed and they're getting new

1205
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,310
instances all the time and for the most

1206
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:28,800
part the first people that are being

1207
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,480
targeted by them most AV products are

1208
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,369
missing and you're really just catching

1209
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,950
it on the back end when you basically

1210
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:36,690
the ancillary damage the collateral

1211
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,730
damage as the virus or malware spreads

1212
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,470
to other people not the first people it

1213
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,220
was intended for that's generally what

1214
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:46,500
AV products are catching one more

1215
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,629
example I'll give and this is I would

1216
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,839
call this this is the consumer and SMB

1217
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:54,180
security problem when people build small

1218
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,410
business products today they're

1219
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,118
generally not thinking about security

1220
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,920
very much in fact some of our

1221
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,010
vulnerability researchers at tripwire

1222
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,260
actually reported vulnerabilities to one

1223
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,210
of these SMB Wi-Fi router manufacturers

1224
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,589
and they said we we just sell to

1225
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,420
consumers we don't they don't care about

1226
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:11,460
security it was like literal reaction

1227
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,109
from them and my researchers were like

1228
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,170
no you do care you just don't know it

1229
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:17,970
yet we're going to tell you why you care

1230
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,810
but the reality is when new things come

1231
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,049
out

1232
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:23,490
IOT devices wearable devices consumer

1233
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,070
things and I'm sure many of you have

1234
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,629
consumer IOT devices that are sitting

1235
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,349
somewhere in

1236
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,519
at home or your dorm the perception is

1237
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,630
these things are built and you can't

1238
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,160
really see the bubble here the

1239
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,750
perception is these things are not very

1240
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,279
vulnerable because nobody's really

1241
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,859
talked about the vulnerability of them

1242
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:41,569
the reality is new things that come out

1243
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:43,308
generally are not being built in a

1244
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:45,500
secure way and that's just a general

1245
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:47,539
blanket statement things that are built

1246
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,089
for large enterprise organizations

1247
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:51,559
probably have the most concern about

1248
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:53,900
security as they're being built today

1249
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,700
things being built for consumers for

1250
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,329
small businesses people don't care about

1251
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,200
it if we move to the end of the curve

1252
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:01,910
security researchers finding

1253
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,500
vulnerabilities they release them they

1254
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:05,180
publish them it gets a lot of news this

1255
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,589
is like Windows everyone knows Windows

1256
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,078
has a ton of vulnerabilities in it right

1257
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:11,058
so the perception becomes in the market

1258
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,500
that these products like Windows have a

1259
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:14,299
ton of vulnerabilities in them these

1260
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,859
things are really insecure meanwhile

1261
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:18,049
these like new things that came out that

1262
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,970
nobody found any vulnerabilities in

1263
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:22,339
people just assumed well I guess these

1264
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,259
things are probably secure I guess

1265
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:26,328
they're secure because nobody has ever

1266
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:29,390
really found any problems in it before

1267
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:31,339
the reality is exactly the opposite

1268
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,618
vulnerability research in my mind is not

1269
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:35,630
really working very well and let me tell

1270
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:38,390
you why when systems are being ignored

1271
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,980
by security researchers it's actually

1272
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,549
really hard to break into those systems

1273
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,829
for most people if you had a consumer

1274
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:48,650
Wi-Fi router that none of the people

1275
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:50,869
back at tripwire got ahold of and tried

1276
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,910
to break into then there are no publicly

1277
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:55,730
available exploits for it it's not built

1278
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:57,170
into Metasploit there are no tools that

1279
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,089
allow you to hit click a button and

1280
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,369
break into that system and so for the

1281
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:03,650
most part the security by obscurity is

1282
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:05,119
protecting people when security

1283
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,099
researchers start to look into these

1284
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,410
challenges they find vulnerabilities

1285
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:11,509
they publish the vulnerabilities they

1286
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,578
then other people release exploits for

1287
00:49:11,509 --> 00:49:14,000
those vulnerabilities and what it turns

1288
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:16,970
into

1289
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,890
is a model where people who care about

1290
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,930
security actually end up with better

1291
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,879
security from those researchers because

1292
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,558
if you care about security now you're in

1293
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,450
a state where well I can patch that

1294
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,920
system I can update the firmware I can

1295
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,240
get to the latest release and now that

1296
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,579
now I'm immune from those

1297
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,129
vulnerabilities that existed but people

1298
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:36,349
who were ignoring security before now

1299
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,240
it's super easy to break into all of

1300
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,980
those people's systems that exists there

1301
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,520
and this is what generally happened in

1302
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,290
the consumer

1303
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,810
in the SMB world over the last several

1304
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:46,460
years which is there's a ton of systems

1305
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,740
out there that are now really easy to

1306
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,930
break into because security researchers

1307
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,819
spent some time showing how insecure

1308
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,440
they are but the people running them

1309
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,240
still don't care enough to patch an

1310
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,620
update those systems and so we've

1311
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,089
actually created an environment where

1312
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:04,339
we've gotten less secure in a number of

1313
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:05,600
areas so let me just finish up here

1314
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,840
we're going to open it up for some

1315
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:13,130
questions but the last point I'll make

1316
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,900
here is I T we spent 25 years trying to

1317
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,180
get ourselves into a more secure state

1318
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,940
and we're continuing to do that it's big

1319
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,500
business it's a big industry there's a

1320
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,450
lot of risk that still exists there

1321
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,930
there are some areas in the world that

1322
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:29,299
are very early in that same cycle of

1323
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:32,060
what happened in IT over the last 25

1324
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,250
years and I call it wherever IP strikes

1325
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,650
we've seen this pattern that has

1326
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,560
recurred where systems went from

1327
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,990
proprietary protocols that were not

1328
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,450
interconnected with each other and not

1329
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,490
connected to the Internet and they were

1330
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,379
systems that security researchers didn't

1331
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,899
pay much attention to they didn't have

1332
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:53,600
access to these systems they didn't know

1333
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:56,120
that these were vulnerable systems that

1334
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,440
they could spend time on and now we've

1335
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,080
seen these industries that are now

1336
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,610
adopting standard IP connecting these

1337
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,020
systems to corporate networks and

1338
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,090
they're creating new levels of

1339
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,920
insecurity we're seeing this happen in

1340
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:09,050
the ICS world the industrial control

1341
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,940
world today as vulnerable ''tis have

1342
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,280
crossed from proprietary protocols the

1343
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,260
standard IP protocol that systems that

1344
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,940
were air-gapped a decade ago are now

1345
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,100
connected to the corporate networks and

1346
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,570
we're seeing an explosion of the number

1347
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,670
of vulnerabilities that are found in

1348
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,800
these devices and this is ultimately

1349
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,540
going to improve the security for people

1350
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,880
who are security conscious in these

1351
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,920
environments and it's also creating a

1352
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,770
massive new amount of risk for people

1353
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,270
who don't pay attention to security I'm

1354
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:39,140
going to skip through a couple of these

1355
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:43,340
slides in the interest of time and go

1356
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,569
right to the end here which is let me

1357
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,930
tell you some other places this is

1358
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:51,170
happening to which is broadcasting the

1359
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:53,730
system that actually send out if you

1360
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,200
have watching a cable channel I know

1361
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,720
students don't watch TV anymore if

1362
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,879
you're watching YouTube but if you have

1363
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,919
a TV there's something on the back end

1364
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,810
that is collecting the media that's

1365
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,310
organizing it it's putting the headers

1366
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,380
and banners around it and then playing

1367
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:09,450
it out to your satellite channels and

1368
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,820
your TV channels those systems were

1369
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,980
using proprietary protocols they were

1370
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,740
air gapped from corporate networks and

1371
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:19,140
these systems are all adopting standard

1372
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,209
IP protocols now you're adopting IP

1373
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,609
because it allows interoperability it

1374
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,800
increases the efficiency and it allows

1375
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:28,799
new technology to make its way into this

1376
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,420
industry this same thing that's

1377
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,040
happening is going to create the same

1378
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,590
risk that we've seen in the industrial

1379
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,350
control world over the last decade and

1380
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,690
are continuing to see today another

1381
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,220
place that's happening healthcare people

1382
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,190
in health care talk about the connected

1383
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,689
hospital room all of the sensors and all

1384
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:48,650
of the devices that are now getting

1385
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:50,730
connected in a hospital room are now

1386
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,100
internet connected they're adopting

1387
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,480
standard IP protocols they're getting

1388
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,180
data that's being pushed back into

1389
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,460
centralized systems these are the same

1390
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,140
thing that's happening new systems are

1391
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,280
getting connected researchers are

1392
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,750
starting to pay attention to these

1393
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,670
systems you've started to see

1394
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,220
vulnerability disclosures about things

1395
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,800
like insulin pumps that actually are

1396
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,779
connected to humans and these are things

1397
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,630
as they start to get attention of

1398
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,580
researchers are going to become less

1399
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,990
secure and create massive risk for the

1400
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,930
people who don't pay attention to the

1401
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,520
security of them so security research

1402
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,200
the progress that we're making in

1403
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,300
securing the system is kind of a

1404
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,100
double-edged sword you can't as these

1405
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,230
things get connected as researchers pay

1406
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,779
attention to them the status quo of

1407
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,010
ignoring them no longer works and we

1408
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,990
need to watch for where this transition

1409
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:40,140
is happening across many different

1410
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:42,890
industries today with that I will open

1411
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,890
it up for some questions

1412
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,920
anyone

1413
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,750
[Music]

1414
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,730
laughter

1415
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,450
I have a quick question so you talked

1416
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,650
about the average company has sixty

1417
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:11,598
security vendors in your talk about

1418
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:14,690
containers and docker and micro services

1419
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,160
I kind of got the impression you're

1420
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,900
collecting information on a more and

1421
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,190
more granular level so what I see is

1422
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,009
we're building a bigger and bigger

1423
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:24,440
haystack and what we need to do is find

1424
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:26,479
the information that really says hey my

1425
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,369
risk is going up do you think we're

1426
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:29,868
going in the right direction and what

1427
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:32,119
are the solutions to this enormous

1428
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:35,329
haystack we're creating yep

1429
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:36,950
so that absolutely think to me there is

1430
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:40,009
a collection problem you have to solve

1431
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,359
so if you lose visibility because of

1432
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:43,880
containers because of new technologies

1433
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,499
people are adopting you need to get the

1434
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,089
visibility back if you don't have the

1435
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:49,098
collection you're going to miss it all

1436
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:50,989
but then you immediately flip through

1437
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:52,700
out too much data and in this in the

1438
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:54,440
commercial security world people talk

1439
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,390
about this as a data analytics and a big

1440
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,489
data issue of how do I sort through all

1441
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,589
of this information and the more that

1442
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,359
you can do in an automatic automated

1443
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:04,400
programmatic basis the better you are

1444
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:06,319
but then at some point then you really

1445
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,539
need big data analytics to really filter

1446
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:10,579
down and sort through and so most

1447
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:13,849
security companies these days are

1448
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:15,979
looking for people like data scientists

1449
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:17,239
to figure out how do I sort through this

1450
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,660
data effectively because that's not a

1451
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:23,630
problem those companies are solved so

1452
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,819
this is a more of a business question in

1453
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:28,789
the commercial space do you see it as

1454
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:31,579
more feasible to have core security

1455
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:33,049
companies or larger IT companies which

1456
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,789
have a security division and an

1457
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:38,599
integrating security with the rest of

1458
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:40,789
their products yep and the way I would I

1459
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:42,769
would I would phrase that is the idea of

1460
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:46,249
doing security engineering into the

1461
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:47,988
products is absolutely the right

1462
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:49,939
approach to for companies to be taking

1463
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:52,609
and so when we talk when I talk to

1464
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:55,460
companies we use this concept of try and

1465
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:57,078
move left which is a lot of the problems

1466
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,239
we try and solve from a security

1467
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,130
organization or a security team or what

1468
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,960
the security officer that large

1469
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:05,630
companies trying to solve is an

1470
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,729
operational security problem it's I have

1471
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,559
a bunch of applications I have different

1472
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:11,779
things that have been collected across

1473
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:13,760
many different parts of my company and

1474
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:16,220
now I need to secure this environment

1475
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,500
the fundamentals of security like the

1476
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,270
fact that our email system on the

1477
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,150
Internet has not been built in a secure

1478
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,740
way is a fundamental issue that all

1479
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,570
sorts of security vendors are trying to

1480
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:28,549
solve on the back end of the problem

1481
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,600
when really we need to solve it on the

1482
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,460
front end of the problem

1483
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,220
secure application development and

1484
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,140
supply chain security is really all

1485
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,270
these ideas of the right place to solve

1486
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,430
it is during the application development

1487
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,230
cycle before things go getting released

1488
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:45,259
and everything that we do on an

1489
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:46,700
operational perspective is very often

1490
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:54,980
just kind of cleaning up the fact they

1491
00:56:46,700 --> 00:57:00,560
didn't do it right back then is ipv6

1492
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:04,580
part of the problem or does it help from

1493
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,890
a from the systems perspective which is

1494
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,650
generally tripwire is mostly playing

1495
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,710
within the systems level so on servers

1496
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,810
on network devices versus monitoring at

1497
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:17,900
the network level or looking at security

1498
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,590
from a whole Internet perspective ipv6

1499
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,630
has not affected what we do at all

1500
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:25,340
certainly people want ipv6 support so we

1501
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,040
want to be able to talk to an ipv6

1502
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:29,900
device or have systems that have ipv6

1503
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,480
addresses communicating with each other

1504
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,609
but we just haven't seen within large

1505
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,350
companies the adoption of it or lack of

1506
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:36,740
adoption really change much of what we

1507
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,618
do

1508
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,060
so I've been security for 20 years we've

1509
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,550
been talking about its impact for 20

1510
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:48,049
years practically speaking at the level

1511
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:50,960
of what we do hasn't change anything hi

1512
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:53,240
so of usable ulnar ability research is

1513
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,310
kind of hurting the security ignorant

1514
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,549
right so as you have more and more of

1515
00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:01,310
these you know secure up connected

1516
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:03,080
devices and hospitals etc actually in

1517
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,330
the more individual basis what is your

1518
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,590
advice to people where sort of security

1519
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:09,470
ignorant them you have so many

1520
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:11,330
categories of security products so looks

1521
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,740
like you know these two are kind of you

1522
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,330
know at loggerheads more the

1523
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,399
vulnerability research the more just

1524
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:20,180
carry ignorant are kind of being exposed

1525
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,280
to the bad guys yep so what's my advice

1526
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,529
I'll give you the consumer versus the

1527
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,589
sister of a large company if you're a

1528
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:29,420
consumer and you care about security

1529
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:31,009
I mean all you can really do is you know

1530
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,709
pop you know keep your system up-to-date

1531
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:37,430
patch try and keep a good firewall in

1532
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:39,259
security for your Wi-Fi at home I have

1533
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:42,589
some of the people at tripwire the more

1534
00:58:39,259 --> 00:58:44,809
paranoid people they firewall off all

1535
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:46,430
traffic they try not to use Smart TVs in

1536
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:48,199
their homes they thought I saw the stuff

1537
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:50,779
that like Vizio and Samsung and how

1538
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:53,269
people are monitoring your TV viewing so

1539
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:55,640
you get really paranoid about it I think

1540
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:57,258
some people will be very paranoid some

1541
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,439
people have just given up and say they

1542
00:58:57,259 --> 00:59:02,119
don't care you know container container

1543
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:03,979
izing and sending boundaries around what

1544
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,749
you're trying to secure that's kind of

1545
00:59:03,979 --> 00:59:07,848
what I do like I tighten secures the

1546
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:09,410
laptop and information there the rest of

1547
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:11,359
my home and like what my kids are doing

1548
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:13,788
in our house and what patches are

1549
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,410
installing on minecraft I just have

1550
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:17,449
given up on that like yeah I don't care

1551
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,129
if they go back into malware now if

1552
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:21,829
you're a large enterprise and you're

1553
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:24,199
worried about this problem you want to

1554
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:25,819
take a framework that you can trust like

1555
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:27,920
the NIF cybersecurity framework the

1556
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:30,349
critical security controls you want to

1557
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,670
orient your organization around what

1558
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:34,249
have we already implemented what's

1559
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:35,779
already working do some gap analysis of

1560
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:38,149
what could we do to improve and

1561
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:40,249
generally what we found is the best

1562
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,839
thing people can do is go back to the

1563
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:43,698
controls they already have implemented

1564
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,429
and figure out how to get more value out

1565
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:48,380
of those things which is different from

1566
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:50,229
the thousand companies who are out there

1567
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,539
who says you just need one more product

1568
00:59:50,229 --> 00:59:55,129
generally it's about process we talk I

1569
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:57,439
talk to customers about the combination

1570
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:58,729
of people process and technology and if

1571
00:59:57,439 --> 01:00:00,439
you could just get more effective and

1572
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:01,848
mature what you already have that's

1573
01:00:00,439 --> 01:00:08,390
probably the biggest bang for the buck

1574
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:12,859
you'll get at the risk of

1575
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:14,538
oversimplifying in the process of

1576
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:16,038
avoiding chasing the next shiny thing

1577
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:19,729
how do you see the intellectual

1578
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:21,529
processes of large enterprises finding

1579
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,879
the methodology the intellectual tools

1580
01:00:21,529 --> 01:00:25,249
to be on the front end of that

1581
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,099
operational design versus the reactive

1582
01:00:25,249 --> 01:00:30,890
side of integrating next shiny thing yep

1583
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:32,420
well most large companies will have

1584
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:34,549
their own application development teams

1585
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,499
and are building their own custom

1586
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:38,538
applications to some extent and so

1587
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:40,910
application security has become a very

1588
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:41,390
big space and DevOps has really helped

1589
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:43,790
people

1590
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:45,650
fake security process into what they're

1591
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,330
building so things like static and

1592
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:49,670
dynamic code analysis tools are really

1593
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:51,590
important for them that integrating to

1594
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:53,140
DevOps so that as they roll out things

1595
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:55,760
they're actually checking the security

1596
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:57,290
before things move into production so

1597
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,240
for instance what our customers who are

1598
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:01,310
using DevOps today they use deployment

1599
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,160
tools like puppet chef and to build

1600
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,960
vagrant products like that and the old

1601
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,450
way of doing vulnerability assessment

1602
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,280
was I go to my production systems and

1603
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,500
once a day once a week once a month I

1604
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,390
scan them looking for the risks the new

1605
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,580
way people are approaching it is I build

1606
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:18,830
an application before it gets rolled out

1607
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:21,860
a scan happens as part of the rollout

1608
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:23,810
and then if I find a risk or a major

1609
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,610
vulnerability it's not even allowed to

1610
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,830
move into production so when you can

1611
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:30,800
automate that entire cycle from finding

1612
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:33,080
the bugs being written by the software

1613
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,700
developers to checking it as part of the

1614
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,980
production rollout I think you get a

1615
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,720
more effective overall security program

1616
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,040
working and again it solves some of that

1617
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,439
problem of the trying to fix it after

1618
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,020
the fact which is almost always too late

1619
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,180
now because the adversaries are moving

1620
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,590
so quickly by the time you've moved it

1621
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:55,370
to production they're going to find it

1622
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:58,010
almost instantly could you comment on

1623
01:01:55,370 --> 01:02:02,750
the adoption from your commercial

1624
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:06,170
clients of looking at DISA Stig's mesh

1625
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:08,690
on the NBD national vulnerability

1626
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:11,210
database mitre CVEs

1627
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:16,340
yep you know are they looking at it are

1628
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:22,430
they not kind of what size company is is

1629
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:25,000
that transition made yep so CVS heavily

1630
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:28,120
heavily used in the security industry

1631
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,810
generally for now correlation of

1632
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,900
vulnerabilities between different

1633
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:35,420
products to enable interoperability and

1634
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,130
even down to the level of you know

1635
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,330
finding a vulnerability on a system and

1636
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,130
someone else has a threat intelligence

1637
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:42,140
feed that's telling you what

1638
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,820
vulnerabilities are being exploited so

1639
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,540
CVE has become the industry standard

1640
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:49,160
index for that in terms of DIF extinct

1641
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,540
clearly in the in the government space

1642
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,790
we've seen a lot of adoption in the

1643
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:54,650
commercial space center for internet

1644
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:56,930
security benchmarks

1645
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:00,349
what we see as the generally most use

1646
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:03,140
standards most large organizations have

1647
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:05,240
taken the CIS benchmarks and done some

1648
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,368
level of tailoring it to their gold

1649
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,589
images or their configuration standards

1650
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:12,380
so they've adopted it the problem with

1651
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:14,538
most CIS standards is you won't get a

1652
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,249
hundred percent passing of what the

1653
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:18,079
security recommendations are for what

1654
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:19,609
people are actually implementing for

1655
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,440
their servers so they try and adjust

1656
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:24,369
them so they can have a better benchmark

1657
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,849
against how they want systems configured

1658
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:27,849
that I cover

1659
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,069
in a general term are the

1660
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,350
vulnerabilities you're talking about

1661
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:40,000
manufactured vulnerabilities are they

1662
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:44,319
where somebody has tampered with the

1663
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,140
software or the programs coming in yeah

1664
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,090
so for the most part when we look at

1665
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,770
vulnerabilities at supplier

1666
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:52,810
we're generally talking about software

1667
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:55,150
flaws that were introducing the

1668
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:57,190
development of the code or the product

1669
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,290
that made its way into the production

1670
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,000
environment tampering is it you know

1671
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,910
tampering is definitely an issue people

1672
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,950
are concerned about but it's not that I

1673
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:07,629
guess it's just not the standard

1674
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:10,230
industry term for vulnerability people

1675
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,860
generally use so it's not a malicious

1676
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,140
vulnerability that you're talking about

1677
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:19,120
now we would talk about that more from

1678
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:21,930
the intrusion more from the breach or an

1679
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,160
incident or a intrusion detection

1680
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:25,779
capability in terms of looking for

1681
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,970
someone doing something malicious to a

1682
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,500
system now it gets tricky because supply

1683
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:31,509
chain management has kind of changed

1684
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,370
that people are very worried about what

1685
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:35,050
comes into their organization has been

1686
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,430
tampered with and you know that's the

1687
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:39,310
whole area of kind of trustworthy

1688
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,600
computing but that's that's a different

1689
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:44,080
area of security than what we generally

1690
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:47,560
plan so it wouldn't do enough just to be

1691
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:50,500
able to identify whoever touch that

1692
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,850
coding that you're worried about there

1693
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,860
there definitely are people who are

1694
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:56,770
concerned about that that part of the

1695
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:59,230
security story you know back to how do I

1696
01:04:56,770 --> 01:05:01,360
know that what was manufactured and the

1697
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:03,190
code that was put on a chip is actually

1698
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,170
what was supposed to be there and when I

1699
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,030
receive it if there's a chain of custody

1700
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:09,550
that proves that the correct thing

1701
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:12,700
that's very it's an important area of

1702
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:15,000
security but again tripwire mostly plays

1703
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,410
on this operational security level where

1704
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,090
I'm trying to manage my broad

1705
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:21,160
infrastructure of everything I have and

1706
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:23,350
so it's already been received and in

1707
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,529
there by the time on monitoring it makes

1708
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,529
sense

1709
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:34,179
[Applause]

1710
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:41,630
