1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,450
good so hello everybody

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,450
come to the next stock in the series of

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,340
serious seminar series this semester so

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,980
today we have somebody local over here

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,660
we have esata from electrical and

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,060
computer engineering department he's

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,820
doing his PhD over there which shares

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,579
under and ashes is generally interested

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,980
in game theory decision theory and

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,540
slightly different topics may be in

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,530
terms of network security but somehow he

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,690
combines do some two of these slightly I

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,670
mean looking at do tapas which look

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,890
quite different but somehow he combines

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,510
them in his security research and today

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,330
he's going to talk about that so your

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,720
talk on behavioral and capitation aspect

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,579
of network security ashish thank you so

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,079
much for her circuitry and thanks for

20
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,180
letting me speak in this seminar series

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,520
so most of this work is done jointly

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,489
with my advisor professors rare syndrome

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,030
as well as professor Suribachi and AP

24
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,979
limits so you know in large-scale

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,229
network systems there are tips such as

26
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:15,759
the electric grid there are a large

27
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:18,350
number of assets control system sensors

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,229
communication networks and the security

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,749
of the systems depends on the decisions

30
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,299
made by multiple stakeholders game

31
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:28,458
theory is a natural framework to

32
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,909
understand the decision-making by these

33
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:34,009
multiple entities so we will start our

34
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,350
discussion with an brief introduction to

35
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,170
game theory and certain behavioral

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,939
aspects of decision making and then we

37
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,579
will look at two related classes of

38
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,339
games first which we refer to as

39
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,229
interdependent security games represent

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,139
situations where we consider a general

41
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,380
network or graph and each node in the

42
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:56,658
network decides how much to invest to

43
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,389
protect itself and the security risk

44
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,189
experienced by the node is a function of

45
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:04,310
the investment by the node and its local

46
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,859
neighbors our focus here will be to

47
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,840
understand how certain behavioral

48
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,329
perception of security risk or attack

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,000
probabilities influence the decision of

50
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,959
these nodes in the second part we will

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,049
look at a more general class of games

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,130
where a defender potentially cares about

53
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,890
protecting multiple nodes in the network

54
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,570
and the attack attack's propagate

55
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,690
throughout the network instead of just

56
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,459
being local in the previous case so

57
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,890
let's start with a brief introduction to

58
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,920
game theory so game theory represents

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,709
situations where we want to understand

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,290
how multiple agents make decisions so

61
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,180
let us consider a general setting with n

62
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,859
agents these are also referred to as

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,740
players in the game theory literature

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,740
and each player chooses a strategy to

65
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,200
maximize its utility okay so let us say

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,420
that we we represent the strategy of a

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,470
player I as little X I and let it be

68
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,380
drawn from set big X I and the utility

69
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,500
of player I is given by a function UI

70
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,680
which depends on its strategy X I as

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,270
well as the strategies of other entities

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
so for example let's say that I have a

73
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,950
computer I am trying to decide whether

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,410
or not to to purchase an antivirus and

75
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,929
let's say that I communicate with your

76
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,510
computer and you have certain access to

77
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,820
certain files in my system so if I

78
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,799
protect or if I buy an antivirus and you

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,079
don't then a virus can infect your

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,540
system and in turn in fact my system so

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,480
my utility defined in terms of whether

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,489
or not I get infected by a virus depends

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,690
not only on whether i purchase anti

84
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,490
virus but also whether you are

85
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,680
purchasing antivirus so that introduces

86
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,510
a game that is the my utility is a

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,190
function of my action as well as your

88
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,670
actions so how do we sort of reason

89
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,670
about this type of multi-agent settings

90
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,429
so the idea is that so the this leads to

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,829
the notion of Nash equilibrium so Nash

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,870
equilibrium is a strategy profile let us

93
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,200
say that player 1 chooses x1 x1 star

94
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,730
player 2 chooses x2 star and so on and

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,790
this profile constitutes an S

96
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,090
equilibrium if for a given player I and

97
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,548
for any other strategy why I within its

98
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,420
set of feasible strategies the utility

99
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,489
of the player evaluated at y I is less

100
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,950
than or equal to the utility of the

101
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,260
player if it has chosen X I star given

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,719
that all other entities choose their

103
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,729
Nash equilibrium strategies right so in

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
other words if every other player

105
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,139
decides to act according to their Nash

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,378
equilibrium then a given player

107
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,389
hi I cannot improve its utility by

108
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,039
choosing any other action other than its

109
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,199
Nash equilibrium action so that is why

110
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,539
if every player is at the Nash

111
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,009
equilibrium no player has any incentive

112
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,990
to unilaterally pick a different

113
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:55,409
strategy so that is why it is referred

114
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,349
to as an equilibrium so clearly a

115
00:04:55,409 --> 00:05:00,150
strategy profile whether or not it ends

116
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,370
up being an ass equilibrium depends very

117
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,080
critically on how these utilities are

118
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,509
defined right so so this leads us to do

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,568
this to the realm of decision theory

120
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,639
which which tells us how you know how to

121
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,129
define utilities and in particular how

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,539
the utilities are defined in the in the

123
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,789
presence of risk that is when the

124
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,529
outcomes are not not certain and this

125
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,628
often ends up being the case in cyber

126
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,330
security domain so you know I can choose

127
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,629
whether or not to buy antivirus or you

128
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,188
know invest to secure my system but it's

129
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,810
not certain whether I will be getting

130
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,349
attacked or not so that is subject to

131
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,900
probabilities so what what classical

132
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,438
models in decision theory say that let's

133
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,089
say I am facing an uncertain situation

134
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,259
where there can be different outcomes

135
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,210
each occurring with different

136
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,460
probabilities okay so let us say that

137
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,938
outcome z1 happens with probability P 1

138
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,250
G 2 with probability P 2 and so on and

139
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:59,490
so this this theory of expected utility

140
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,149
theory says that there exists a utility

141
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,310
function V and I should assign the

142
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,129
utility to this uncertain outcome in the

143
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,319
following way that I should evaluate the

144
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,210
utility as into the in terms of the

145
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,009
function V of each different possible

146
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,299
outcome and multiply with the

147
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,659
corresponding probability of that

148
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,969
outcome and I define my utility

149
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:23,310
according to this function and you know

150
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,020
when if I am facing multiple uncertain

151
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,539
outcomes and I want to pick one of them

152
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,698
I should evaluate the expected utility

153
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,699
of each uncertain outcome and pick the

154
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:38,219
one which is the highest expected it

155
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:41,339
okay however you know the the the human

156
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:43,529
decision makers often do not exactly

157
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,289
follow the the predictions of expected

158
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,330
utility theory and in fact the the way

159
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,950
human beings perceive the utilities and

160
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,200
probabilities can be very different from

161
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:58,300
that true values so we will focus on the

162
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,610
misperception of probabilities in this

163
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,230
talk and in fact you know this is

164
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,180
extremely relevant in the security

165
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,720
domain because we are always facing risk

166
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,360
in drinks risk of whether I am get going

167
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,010
to get infected by a virus is often

168
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,140
defined in terms of probabilities right

169
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,080
so it's important to understand how we

170
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,360
perceive these probabilities and we will

171
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,969
capture these perception of

172
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,590
probabilities drawn from a very

173
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,090
well-known theory of behavioral

174
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,840
decision-making which is known as

175
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,239
prospect theory and it was proposed by

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,250
Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 and in fact

177
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,190
Daniel Kahneman won the nobel prize in

178
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:40,450
economics for his contributions to to

179
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,790
behavioral economics so so just to just

180
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,550
to illustrate how we don't perceive the

181
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:48,580
probabilities as their two values let's

182
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:52,060
consider a very simple example let's say

183
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,250
that I asked you to choose between one

184
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,650
of these two options the in option one

185
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,260
you can win three thousand dollars with

186
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,820
probability 0 point 25 in option to you

187
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,580
can win four thousand dollars with

188
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,370
probability point2 you know if this is

189
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,140
asked you know this example is drawn

190
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,850
from the the original prospect theory

191
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,000
paper and where they conduct experiments

192
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,880
on human subjects in many different lab

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,830
conditions and what they find is that in

194
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,219
the majority of the cases participants

195
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,080
prefer option to right and in this case

196
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,850
the option to also turns out to have the

197
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,590
highest expected value you know this the

198
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,620
option to has eight hundred dollars and

199
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,110
and option one has seven fifty dollars

200
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,929
okay now if I if I change the example a

201
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,280
little bit now in option one you can win

202
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,780
three thousand dollars with probability

203
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,809
1 so there's none no uncertainty

204
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,250
associated there and in option to you

205
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,989
can win four thousand dollars with

206
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,630
probability point eight and if I asked

207
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,700
this question in lab in a majority of

208
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,670
the cases it has been found that people

209
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,910
choose option one they don't want any

210
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,310
risk while involving the they're there

211
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,140
to work and if you notice the

212
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,729
probabilities in the second case or four

213
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,520
times the corresponding probabilities in

214
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,279
the first case so if people actually you

215
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,839
know

216
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,149
probabilities and as they are true

217
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,550
values and the computer the expected

218
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,259
utilities which are linear functions of

219
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,990
the probabilities this type of

220
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:19,910
inconsistency will not arise right so in

221
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,949
order to understand this you know there

222
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,439
have been a larger body of work in

223
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:27,829
behavioral economics to identify how we

224
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:30,430
actually do percy probabilities and what

225
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,569
has been found is that we consistently

226
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,258
overweight small probabilities and

227
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:38,149
underweight large properties so so the

228
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,519
perception of probabilities are often

229
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,680
captured in terms of weighting functions

230
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,089
one example is there is the pre light

231
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,870
weighting function which has which is

232
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,759
shown in the in the in the graph so it's

233
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,610
a parametric form of weighting functions

234
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,680
and the parameter beta controls the

235
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,120
degree of overweighting of small

236
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,248
probabilities and under waiting applause

237
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,230
probabilities if beta equal to one then

238
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:01,939
we perceive probabilities exactly as

239
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,749
their true values and a bit I get

240
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:07,160
smaller our deviation from the true sort

241
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:08,589
of out deviation in perceived

242
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,230
probabilities from the true value

243
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:18,709
increases more and more okay so now

244
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,569
let's go to the the first class of games

245
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:23,420
that we are going to look at and here we

246
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:25,219
will try to understand the impact of the

247
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,680
behavioral perception of probabilities

248
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,870
that I just discussed on the security

249
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:38,689
investment strategies of the of the

250
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:41,089
agents any questions so far so so the

251
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:43,279
class of games we will look at our refer

252
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,139
to as interdependent security games so

253
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,370
it's a very general class of

254
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:52,490
mathematical formulation okay so you

255
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,100
know the in the most general case it's

256
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,319
the game is defined on a general graph

257
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,660
or a network which is a collection of

258
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,569
nodes and edges and let's say that there

259
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,639
are n nodes in this graph each node

260
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:07,370
decides you know how much to invest in

261
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,899
security and the attack probability on

262
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,879
the node is a function of the nodes

263
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,040
investment and the of its direct

264
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,649
neighbors there has been a large body of

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,870
work in this class of games studying the

266
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:21,710
properties of the equilibrium and so on

267
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,420
but most have so far focused on assuming

268
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,270
that the notes are risk neutral and

269
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,420
don't consider the behavioral perception

270
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,329
of probabilities and values stitute to

271
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,459
to make the setting more precise so we

272
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,980
are going to denote the security

273
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,640
investment of a node or a player I as

274
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,800
the quantity SI and we without loss of

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,460
generality we assume that si is a real

276
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,170
number between 0 and 1 and the the

277
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,830
probability of successful attack on a

278
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,620
node is a function of Si and an S minus

279
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,480
I where s minus y represents the vector

280
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,020
of security investments by its neighbors

281
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,670
and if a player is risk you know and if

282
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,100
the if the player is successfully

283
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,319
attacked it experiences a loss of

284
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,270
magnitude Li and there is a per-unit

285
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,940
cost of security investment which is CI

286
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,980
so if the player is risk neutral we can

287
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,160
write out its expected utility as

288
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,130
follows which is minus Ally times the

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,140
probability that it gets attacked and

290
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,520
you know 0 which is the loss if it

291
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,550
doesn't get a tight so that time is

292
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,540
missing and then the cost of investing

293
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,240
in security so here we will focus on a

294
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,020
special choice of attack probability

295
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,660
function fi which is defined as 1 minus

296
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,660
the average security investment by a

297
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,480
note and it's direct neighbors so in

298
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,600
this example graph the attack

299
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,990
probability experienced by node 5 is 1

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,330
minus s 5 which is its own investment

301
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,100
and then plus s 3 plus s 4 which are the

302
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,040
investments of its rate of its direct

303
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:03,830
neighbors divided by 3 which is to take

304
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:06,620
the average and so with before going

305
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,940
into understanding how a behavioral

306
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,640
perception of these probabilities

307
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,970
influence investment decisions let us

308
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,740
look at the case where the players are

309
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,620
is neutral and understand they are

310
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,529
optimal investments so for this in this

311
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,230
particular game so we can we can write

312
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:27,290
out the expected utility for a risk

313
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,839
neutral player as we defined before and

314
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,920
then if we take the derivative of this

315
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,260
eternity as

316
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,500
with respect to the investment of a

317
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,269
player then note that this marginal

318
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,070
utility does not depend on the

319
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,899
strategies of the neighbors in fact it

320
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,709
is only a function of the degree of the

321
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:48,529
node and the and the loss parameters

322
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,018
okay so therefore the the optimal

323
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,060
strategy of a node is going to be to

324
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:56,449
invest one that is to completely protect

325
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,839
itself if DIC I over a lie is less than

326
00:13:56,449 --> 00:14:02,149
1 or 2 don't or to not invest anything

327
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,510
if DIC I over a lie is strictly bigger

328
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,540
than one okay that is the the outside of

329
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,310
the special case of DIC I over Li equal

330
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,300
to 1 the node either completely protect

331
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,250
itself or does not invest anything so we

332
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,319
are going to focus on the question of

333
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,850
what happens if the node does not

334
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
perceive the probabilities are the two

335
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,010
probabilities and exhibit the behavioral

336
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,779
characteristics we discussed before so

337
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,600
in particular we will try to understand

338
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,180
does there exist a pure Nash equilibrium

339
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,540
in this class of games how does the

340
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,989
investments and the basic and the

341
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,040
equilibrium security risk depend on the

342
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,440
properties of the weighting function and

343
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:47,719
how to do these quantities depend on the

344
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,339
structure of the network right so as we

345
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,529
discussed before we are going to focus

346
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,720
on the class of weighting functions that

347
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:56,779
was proposed by predict and it has

348
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,180
certain sort of nice analytically

349
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:05,449
tractable properties which helps us

350
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:07,719
establish these results okay so let's

351
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,459
consider the the utility of a player

352
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,260
which purse which has this nonlinear

353
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,500
perception of probability so as before

354
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,910
we can write that li is the is the loss

355
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,610
experienced by the player if it's

356
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,380
successfully attack now so this is now

357
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,790
multiplied with the perceived

358
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,260
probability which is the weighting

359
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,599
function evaluated at the true

360
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,449
probability of attack and minus the cost

361
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,389
of investment and security so now if we

362
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,069
take the derivative of this weighting

363
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,130
function with respect to the investment

364
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:38,870
of the player it now depends on the the

365
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,890
investment of the player that of its

366
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,040
neighbors as well as the other

367
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,870
parameters so and so this this leads to

368
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,199
the the problem being more

369
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,700
complex and the optimal strategy no

370
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,890
longer has the simple structure of

371
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,390
completely protecting itself for not

372
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,920
protecting at all so it is now going to

373
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,150
depend on what other players are doing

374
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,640
what we have been able to show is that

375
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,100
under certain technical assumptions

376
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,770
there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in

377
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,470
this class of games and in fact this

378
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,050
existence result holds even when the

379
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,279
players have different degrees of you

380
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,050
know different weighting functions that

381
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,300
is you know each player can have a

382
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,890
different degree to which they deviate

383
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,439
from true perception of probabilities

384
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,060
and you know they're still they will

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,160
still exist appear Nash equilibrium if

386
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,319
these conditions are satisfied and these

387
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:34,610
are satisfied when the degree of a node

388
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:36,860
is not too small right so having said

389
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:41,450
that so how does the equilibrium

390
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,250
compared with the case without any sort

391
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,600
of probability weighting that is when

392
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,350
the players are completely risk neutral

393
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,459
and we can show that in any graph and

394
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,279
even with potentially different players

395
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,349
with different degrees of non linear

396
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,870
probability perceptions the attack

397
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,450
probability experienced at a node is

398
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,209
always less than one ok if I'll note

399
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,770
that under certain parametric regimes in

400
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,079
the in the in the case with risk neutral

401
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,819
players that did exist equilibria which

402
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,369
was completely unprotected right we're

403
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,309
known where every node decided not to

404
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:19,729
invest anything at all and this is this

405
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:22,010
is true because the property that human

406
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,780
beings underweight large probabilities

407
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,449
okay so let's say we start with the

408
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,450
situation where no player has invested

409
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:33,010
anything and I am experiencing a high

410
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,240
probability which is one so if I if I am

411
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,629
underweight the large probabilities and

412
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,000
I decide to invest a small amount then

413
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,770
my true attack probability decreases by

414
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,440
a small amount but I perceive that

415
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,990
decrease to be much larger so therefore

416
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,059
while if I were risk neutral I would not

417
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,970
make that investment because the true

418
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,010
decrease in the track probability small

419
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,920
me being behavioral incentivizes me to

420
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,129
make that investment

421
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:04,300
therefore with these behavioral users

422
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,430
they're in any graph d that doesn't

423
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,930
exist any Nash equilibrium where the

424
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,730
attack probability of the nodes is equal

425
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,710
to 1 so so does it mean that behavioral

426
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,230
perception of probabilities always leads

427
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:22,900
to more secure equilibrium the answer to

428
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:25,990
that is no so so let so let us consider

429
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:30,100
a graph which is d regular that is every

430
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,170
node has exactly d neighbors now let's

431
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,409
say that I consider two sets of players

432
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:39,040
in one set every node you know every

433
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,690
every every every node has a behavioral

434
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,000
perception of probability given by the

435
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,520
brilliant function parameter beta 1 and

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,590
in the second set of second set of

437
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,750
players have a weighting function with

438
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,300
parameter beta 2 right so that is the in

439
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,880
the second set of games the players are

440
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,100
more closer to being being the

441
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,350
risk-neutral case that is the that does

442
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,699
that they don't have a large deviation

443
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,209
from the true probability in their

444
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,130
perceptions okay now what we have been

445
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,680
able to show is that there exists a

446
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,120
threshold so that if the if the degrees

447
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,580
of the nodes is larger than this

448
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,830
threshold then the equilibrium is more

449
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,659
secure in the case where the players of

450
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,740
a large deviation from true probability

451
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,750
right so in particular in degree regular

452
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:28,270
graphs there exists an interior

453
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:29,800
equilibrium where every node where the

454
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,250
investments are such that every node

455
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,760
experiences are true attack probability

456
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,950
equal to X 2 where X 2 is the is what is

457
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,200
shown in the in the first graph which is

458
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,880
the solution to the which is the

459
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,680
intersection point of their of the line

460
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,570
DC / l and the derivative of the

461
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,440
weighting function the one that is

462
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,419
closer to one and if the if the degree

463
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,770
is higher than this threshold then the

464
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,450
value of x 2 is closer to 1 so therefore

465
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,610
similar to the to the previous case the

466
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,260
players which have a more substantial

467
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,770
degree of under weighting of high

468
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,000
probabilities they tend to invest more

469
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,950
compared to the players whose weighting

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,360
functions are closer to linear because

471
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,010
for the players which are

472
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,199
higher degree of under waiting their

473
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,730
perceived reduction in attack

474
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,120
probability is higher compared to the

475
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,040
players which are closer to linear on

476
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,620
the other hand if the degrees of the

477
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,590
nodes is less than this threshold the

478
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,479
players which whose perception of

479
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,570
probabilities are closer to the true

480
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,610
values invest invest higher and the

481
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:38,679
attack probability in the corresponding

482
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:40,629
equilibrium is smaller right so to

483
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,000
summarize the effect of weighting

484
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,790
function is most beneficial when the

485
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,650
attack probability is high while the

486
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,570
when the attack probability is the

487
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,820
moderate level players which are closer

488
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,899
to this neutral tend to invest more and

489
00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:05,250
that leads to a more secure equilibrium

490
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:08,560
okay is there any questions here so

491
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,070
let's now discuss the the impact of the

492
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,780
structure of the network on the

493
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,790
equilibrium at I probabilities so in

494
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,290
fact let's say that you know we know

495
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,270
that there exist in nash equilibrium

496
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,730
select p i start with the attack

497
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,910
probability at node I at the Nash

498
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:27,760
equilibrium and first we obtain a bound

499
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,070
on P I star which is a function of the

500
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,410
degree of the node okay and you know

501
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,110
this an increasing concave function that

502
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,160
is a node of the higher degree

503
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,899
experiences a higher attack probability

504
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,970
at equilibrium but you know that the

505
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,730
effect is tends to have a diminishing

506
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,900
property and the to define an overall

507
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,470
measure of security of the entire

508
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,260
network we consider the quantity V Star

509
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,030
which is defined as the the bound on the

510
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,950
expected fraction of nodes that are

511
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,710
attacked at the equilibrium so for the

512
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,140
overall network we will consider set of

513
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,940
players the players will you know we'll

514
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,310
look at the strategy profile of the Nash

515
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,260
equilibrium and that will induce an

516
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,120
attack probability for every node and we

517
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,410
define the expected fraction of nodes

518
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,080
that are attacked at that equilibrium

519
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:18,820
and we considered that as a measure of

520
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,399
the security of the overall network so

521
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,830
so what we we have this following main

522
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,049
result which says that

523
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,658
among all graphs with a given number of

524
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,370
nodes and edges the bound on the

525
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,200
expected fraction of nodes that are

526
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,539
attacked at the equilibrium is highest

527
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,179
when the graphs is degree regular that

528
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:41,980
is when every node has the same exact

529
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:44,799
number of neighbors and second among all

530
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,809
connected graphs and endnotes the

531
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,379
quantity freestar is smallest in a star

532
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:52,149
graph so so as we saw before the if the

533
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,000
nodes have a higher degree that leads to

534
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:56,610
a higher that leads to a higher attack

535
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,980
probability at the equilibrium and

536
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,049
therefore in if we look at the the graph

537
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,659
which has the smallest freestar that

538
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,860
ends up being the star graph which is

539
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,620
which has the which has the fewest

540
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,779
number of edges assuming that the

541
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,518
network remains connected and among all

542
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,490
trees the star graph ends up being

543
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,700
minimum and second among all graphs with

544
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,710
n nodes and edges Feaster is smallest in

545
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,230
a class of graphs known as the quasi

546
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:27,730
complete graph so this graph essentially

547
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,139
has the property that we form a click or

548
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,320
a subset of nodes which are fully

549
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:33,939
connected and then and then the

550
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,070
remaining nodes are disconnected from

551
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,370
the overall network right so essentially

552
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,620
what it does is that it distributes the

553
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,600
edges among as few nodes as possible and

554
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,610
leaves the other nodes are disconnected

555
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,590
from the graph question so you mentioned

556
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,870
for the starter but there can be the top

557
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,059
illogical artery right we're just want

558
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,789
to do two to three connection like that

559
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:01,029
that offer the equal number of edges all

560
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:04,440
right so wow you mentioned the reason

561
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:07,899
behind star graph being things because

562
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,240
it has the least number of edges but if

563
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:12,459
we have this such a king it's not a it's

564
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,769
not actually eat regular because some

565
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,679
nodes have only one well that's have to

566
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:21,549
but if that is the case that is the star

567
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:25,750
graph is Lisa susceptible than that or

568
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,730
let ya so so the star is a you know if

569
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,010
we consider a star on n nodes it has n

570
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,440
minus 1 edges so there are lot of graphs

571
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,970
with n nodes and n minus 1 edges so what

572
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,889
we have what we have shown that among

573
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,590
all trees that is the end nodes with n

574
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,658
minus 1 I just the start is

575
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,510
in fact from any tree there is a

576
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:46,260
procedure from which we can we can

577
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:49,470
construct so if any tree which is not a

578
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,240
start we can reelect assign the edges in

579
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,299
a way that will lead to a smaller feast

580
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:00,000
and only from the star graph there is no

581
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:02,879
such reallocation possible yeah so from

582
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,309
a physical topology this makes sense but

583
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,620
do most people think this through when

584
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:10,529
they're on of on the internet I mean is

585
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:15,570
it relevant to what they make into their

586
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:18,360
decisions on security investment so so

587
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:22,139
star is a very specific class of graph

588
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,059
and from what I know in the the

589
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,159
connection of the internet apologies

590
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,658
more like a corporate ferry graph so

591
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,010
which is a there's a small number of

592
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,539
nodes which are very highly

593
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,890
interconnected and there are large

594
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,169
number of peripheries which are

595
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,270
connected to the code notes so star is a

596
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,730
very special class of corporate notes

597
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,520
where there is a single corner and in

598
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,700
fact more generally you know if we if we

599
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,320
impose other restrictions on on the

600
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,169
structure of the network we can show

601
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,870
that the the graphs which have achieved

602
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:53,309
a smaller fee star are belong to a more

603
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,830
general class of graphs known as

604
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,899
threshold drafts and corpora photographs

605
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,029
are examples of threshold graphs so here

606
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,559
i have only imposed very minimal

607
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,630
assumptions that then all connected

608
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,580
graph and endnotes are get all graphs

609
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,200
and n nodes re edges but you can impose

610
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,379
more conditions that minimum

611
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,700
connectivity and others and and what

612
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,409
ends up happening is that for other

613
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,840
classes of graphs the fee star will be

614
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:24,020
smallest 44 threshold due to their

615
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,020
specific properties yeah

616
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:32,080
so to summarize the discussion in this

617
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:34,629
section we showed that if we if we

618
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,309
incorporate the behavioral perception of

619
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:40,209
probabilities it gives rise to a more

620
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,730
richer class of Nash equilibrium

621
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,119
compared to the case with only risk

622
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,269
neutral players and the benefits of

623
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:51,158
these weighting functions in terms of

624
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:52,989
incentivizing agents to invest more or

625
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,539
leading to smaller attack probability is

626
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:56,830
highest when the attack probabilities is

627
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,080
quite high or the network is

628
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,220
sufficiently dense and the optimal

629
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,049
networks tend to be graphs which which

630
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,749
assign edges to few notes as possible

631
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:13,049
and leave a lot of other notes potential

632
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:21,399
is connected so let's go to the the

633
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:24,549
second part of this talk and just so

634
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:27,189
this this proc this setting is motivated

635
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,749
by large-scale network systems for

636
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,289
example the power grid which have a

637
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:34,989
large number of stakeholders for example

638
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:37,570
the generators have their own industrial

639
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:39,789
control system scatter networks the

640
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,499
distribution companies have advanced

641
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:43,509
meters that they have deployed and there

642
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:45,940
are sensors and actuators you know in

643
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:48,309
the in the transmission system and these

644
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,070
entities are being managed by different

645
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:52,359
stakeholders but they still communicate

646
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,369
among each other exchange information

647
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:59,168
and so on so these interdependencies

648
00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:02,519
between the assets that belong to

649
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:05,259
different stakeholders are often

650
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,529
exploited by attackers to to propagate

651
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:11,470
their attack and so our goal here is to

652
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:17,080
to propose a systematic framework to

653
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:18,999
compute optimal and decentralized sort

654
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:24,908
of defense resource allocation in these

655
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:27,340
last graphs so so okay so we define this

656
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:30,100
notion of interdependency graph to

657
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,350
capture the interdependencies of between

658
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:36,129
different assets so every node in this

659
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,629
graph can can correspond to any cyber or

660
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:40,659
physical asset

661
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,430
and the presence of an edge between two

662
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,730
nodes means that that a node is

663
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:49,180
dependent on the the node that of or its

664
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:52,510
parent so there are potentially multiple

665
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:55,420
defenders in this that are responsible

666
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,760
for the security of these assets so in

667
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,260
this example the defender one cares

668
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,690
about protecting the blue assets

669
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,440
defender to cares about protecting the

670
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:07,570
green assets and so on and and there can

671
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,620
be certain nodes which are attackers and

672
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,780
we assume that there is a single

673
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,459
attacker which can represent which is

674
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,530
which can be coming from outside of the

675
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,290
network and the attacker tries to come

676
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:19,720
in it first it doesn't have access to

677
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,730
all the notes directly so it compromises

678
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,830
the denotes that it has access to for

679
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,440
example you know firewalls or that are

680
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,449
other perimeter defense components and

681
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,550
then once it has successfully

682
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,860
compromised a node it can look at the

683
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,990
other nodes that that depend on this

684
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,570
note to lunch there are tax rate so if

685
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,790
there is an edge between nodes UI and UJ

686
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,649
+ ey is compromised then the attacker

687
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:46,920
can launch an attack on YouTube because

688
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:50,140
through through this link you uiuj and

689
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,740
we assume that there is a probability of

690
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:56,200
the attack launched from you I on UJ to

691
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,480
be successful and this probability is

692
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,350
denoted by P IJ 0 so this attack

693
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,740
succeeds with probability P I Z 0 and if

694
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,320
if a node is compromised there you know

695
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,290
the different nodes if that node is

696
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,070
valuable than the defender experiences a

697
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:20,350
loss of magnitude alight are there any

698
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:22,929
questions here okay so we will sort of

699
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,949
consider a general class of defense

700
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:30,700
strategies so the goal of the defender

701
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,560
is to allocate defense resources to

702
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:37,090
reduce the attack probabilities on these

703
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,490
edges ok so we denote by X IJ K the

704
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:42,639
difference resource allocated on edge

705
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,230
uiuj by defender k and multiple

706
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,390
defenders can potentially assign

707
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,700
resources on the same age if there is an

708
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,590
edge which is valuable to to multiple

709
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,309
defenders they can they can collaborate

710
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,639
and

711
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:56,230
defend it directly and the and the

712
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:58,629
probability of the attack being

713
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,940
successful on an edge under this defense

714
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:04,059
allocation is that is the probability of

715
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,909
a type without any defense x the

716
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:10,090
function exponential function like that

717
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:11,379
exp of minus of the sum of the

718
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,959
difference allocation by all the

719
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:18,100
defenders on that edge so what this

720
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,499
means is that so for any finite defense

721
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,908
resource allocation on a given edge the

722
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:24,429
attack probability never completely

723
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:27,309
becomes zero so it starts decreasing as

724
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:29,169
far as the total defense allocation

725
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:32,850
increases but it's still because it

726
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:38,139
remains nonzero for if it for any finite

727
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:39,908
and and we can also impose other

728
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:42,998
restrictions you know for example that

729
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:45,220
that the total defense resource

730
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:50,110
available to a defender is subject to a

731
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:52,720
budget constraint so more generally we

732
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,879
can also you know define that restrict

733
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,950
which edges can be defined defended by

734
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,590
which defender and we can also look at

735
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,360
the case where the defense research that

736
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,209
is being allocated to multiple edges can

737
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,240
be correlated but let's focus on the on

738
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,860
the special case where the difference is

739
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,509
allocated on every edge is independent

740
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,969
ok now how do we define the probability

741
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:18,519
of attack on an asset ok so let's say

742
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,950
that we consider the node um as an asset

743
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,350
there are multiple paths from the

744
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,210
attacker to this node and for a given

745
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,080
path the probability of attack on this

746
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,210
node is the product of probabilities of

747
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:36,970
attacks being successful of each of the

748
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:39,460
edges that are in that path and we

749
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,679
define the cost function for a defender

750
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,570
as follows so note that each defender

751
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,269
cares about protecting multiple assets

752
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:49,059
so for every asset that that it controls

753
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:51,070
the order it cares about we look at the

754
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,019
magnitude of loss that the defender

755
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:57,009
experiences if the audacity is attacked

756
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:59,710
and we we multiply it with the with the

757
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,789
probability of attack on that node via

758
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,590
the path which has the highest

759
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,658
probability of attack that is we are

760
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,849
implicitly assuming that there instead

761
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:08,529
Jake attacker and for every node it

762
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:10,269
targets it picks the path which is the

763
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:12,879
highest probability of attack and the

764
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:15,999
defender is trying to minimize the

765
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:18,039
expected cost subject to this path with

766
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,409
the highest probability of attack maybe

767
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:25,330
I missed it but is the attacker knows

768
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:27,340
we're all defenders a city sorry does

769
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,609
the attack that occur know where all the

770
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,809
defenders are sitting on the network

771
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:35,139
because you mentioning is the strategic

772
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,840
attacker yes so what what we you know so

773
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:41,379
in what we are trying to capture here is

774
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,999
the following okay so so typically there

775
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,949
is not a single attackers the different

776
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,269
attackers there are large number of

777
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,239
attackers who are trying to attack

778
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:51,249
different components of value and the

779
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:54,009
defender has a certain number of nodes

780
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:55,450
that it cares about so but it doesn't

781
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,309
know which one is being attacked by

782
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,349
which attacker but it still has to

783
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:02,019
assign the difference resources to

784
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:05,200
protect each of these assets so for

785
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:08,289
every asset it has to define the risk of

786
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,119
that asset and what I we have assumed is

787
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,220
that it refines that risk in a

788
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,379
worst-case manner that it thinks that ok

789
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:16,418
so let's say that this asset is being

790
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:18,009
attacked by strategic attacker and what

791
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:19,418
will a strategic attack ado let's say

792
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,639
that it has all the information to

793
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:23,049
assume the worst case and then if it has

794
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,919
all the information it's going to pick

795
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:26,859
the path which as the highest

796
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,868
probability of successful attack so so

797
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,179
that that is what motivated us to pick

798
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,230
this specific form of expected cost for

799
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:37,918
the defender okay so when you say a

800
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,629
strategic attacker does that imply that

801
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,399
he's already mapped the battlespace in

802
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,288
the sense and figured out the weak

803
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,578
points of the different networks and and

804
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:51,129
no end devices yes so usually it is hard

805
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:53,619
for a defender to know you know how much

806
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:55,359
information the attacker has but if the

807
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,339
defender is trying to defend against

808
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,140
worst case attack you know it's a good

809
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:01,869
assumption to make that the the attacker

810
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,430
has already mapped out the network so so

811
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:06,400
in order to defend against these worst

812
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,020
get worst case attacks we have defined

813
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,260
the cost function of a defendant in this

814
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,259
manner

815
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,369
okay so the questions we will consider

816
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,049
here is that again as before does there

817
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:22,290
exist a pure Nash equilibrium in the

818
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:25,920
game between multiple defenders how does

819
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:28,020
a defender compute the optimal defense

820
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,080
strategy even assuming it knows this

821
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,730
different strategies of others and you

822
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,830
know how does the the total expected

823
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,260
cost the total expected cost of all the

824
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,640
defenders at the Nash equilibrium

825
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,470
compared to the case when there is a

826
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,029
central authority which is defending all

827
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,919
the assets in the network on behalf of

828
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:50,760
every defender okay so what we do is

829
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,770
that to help with the analysis we define

830
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,540
the notion of length of an edge which is

831
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,990
the negative of the log of the

832
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,970
probability of attack on that edge and

833
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,740
under a given difference allocation what

834
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,910
it ends up being is that the the length

835
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,950
of an edge is equal to the sum of the

836
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,720
length without any attack probability

837
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:15,149
and the sum of difference allocation of

838
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:17,069
all the players so this helps us sort of

839
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,619
uncovers some important properties of

840
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,490
the cost functions in particular the the

841
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:25,920
cost function defined before is now

842
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:28,140
convex in the strategies of the

843
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,970
corresponding defender if I hold the

844
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:34,859
defense allocations of other defenders

845
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:37,259
fixed and as a result this game and what

846
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,319
multiple defenders has a pure Nash

847
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,089
equilibrium because this class of games

848
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,589
belong to a well-known class of games

849
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:45,690
known as concave games which have

850
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:50,369
already been shown to have pure Nash

851
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:52,470
equilibria so now you know an

852
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,910
equilibrium exists but from the

853
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,848
perspective of the defender it is

854
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,680
important to to find the optimal defense

855
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,630
allocation given the set of allocation

856
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,270
of other defenders and we have shown

857
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,160
that finding this optimal defense

858
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,560
allocation also known as the best

859
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,259
response of a defender can be computed

860
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,740
by solving a convex optimization problem

861
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,050
and similarly a central authority which

862
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,729
is assigning defense resources to all

863
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,160
the edges on behalf of every defender

864
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,190
can find the optimal defense allocation

865
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,200
by solving a convex optimization

866
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,210
so you know but but this what it means

867
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,040
is that you know convex problems in

868
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,349
continuous optimization tend to be ones

869
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,079
which are sort of more efficient to

870
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,970
solve and there are well known solvers

871
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,930
available that you can use to solve it

872
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:41,700
and even for large networks it's it's

873
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,470
easier to find the globally optimal

874
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,149
solution so this result is really

875
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:50,700
helpful from a from a computational

876
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:52,880
perspective so so the in the previous

877
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,439
case we showed that for a given

878
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,260
difference allocation by other defenders

879
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,940
a single defender can find its

880
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,579
difference allocation by solving the

881
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,800
convex problem but that still doesn't

882
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,690
give us the Nash equilibrium so in order

883
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,599
to find the Nash equilibrium what we do

884
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,579
is that we start with any random

885
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,920
difference allocation by the defenders

886
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,569
then we pick a defender find its optimal

887
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,130
different strategy go to the next

888
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:20,130
different or find its optimal different

889
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,750
strategy given the new defense

890
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,329
allocation of the previous player and

891
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,819
this process converges in the in the

892
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:29,280
class of games we looked at we don't

893
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:33,000
have a result of convergence to the Nash

894
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,250
equilibrium in the most general case but

895
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,349
what we have shown is that the case

896
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,170
where each player only controls are only

897
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:43,819
cares about one node with there is a

898
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,819
direct way to find the Nash equilibria

899
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:51,420
so in a so before concluding it I will

900
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,940
show a very simple example so we

901
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,390
consider a scatter network so this this

902
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,369
this is motivated by the design

903
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,740
documents from NIS T which shows how the

904
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,500
topology of industrial control systems

905
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,839
and so the in the example here there are

906
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,640
two control subsystems and there are

907
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:11,578
certain interdependencies between them

908
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,348
so in particular the the remote terminal

909
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,630
units are to use are from the same

910
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:17,819
vendor in both different systems so if

911
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,560
an attacker compromises one after you or

912
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:21,270
compromises the vendor then it

913
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,640
understands the system better and can

914
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:28,500
use that to launch attack another are to

915
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:31,500
use directly so in the in the in the

916
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,900
numerical study our focus is to compare

917
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,630
three quantities the first is the social

918
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,730
optimum which is the total expected cost

919
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,570
under a centralized optimal defense

920
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,790
allocation the second is a case where we

921
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,550
restrict each player to only defend

922
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:49,620
their portion of the network okay so a

923
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,920
defender can only defend the edges that

924
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,630
belongs to its notes and in the third

925
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,190
case which is the joint defense any

926
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,560
defender can defend anywhere in the

927
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,000
network okay I can go in and if I if I

928
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,500
think that you are not doing a good job

929
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,540
with a defense or you don't have enough

930
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,340
budget I can go in and defend portions

931
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,740
of the network and that might help me

932
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:12,630
because our components are

933
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:15,870
interdependent on each other so the plot

934
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,340
here shows the how these three

935
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,650
quantities compared with each other so

936
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,320
the x-axis is the budget of player 1

937
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,380
well we assume that the total budget is

938
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,210
fixed at 24 the left graph and if the

939
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,150
budget of player 1 is say five the

940
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,640
budget of player 2 is 50 so because the

941
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,190
total budget is 20 the the social

942
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,290
optimum which were the central authority

943
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,520
assigns defense where everybody is the

944
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,470
same because you know the central

945
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,940
authority gets the defense budget from

946
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,910
each player and then assigns accordingly

947
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,560
and what we show is that as the budget

948
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,109
of player 1 and player 2 grows very

949
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,150
different from each other they join the

950
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,830
case with the joint defense that is when

951
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,820
a player can defend anywhere in the

952
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:58,350
network leads to a smaller social cost

953
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,620
compared to the case where the players

954
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:03,930
only different portions of the network

955
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,930
so you know so the take-home point is

956
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:09,600
that when the budgets are asymmetric it

957
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:12,899
is it might make sense for a player to

958
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,339
to assign it some of its defense

959
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,880
resources to the different player

960
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:21,150
because of the interdependencies to

961
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,580
summarize we presented a general

962
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:27,030
framework to model security investments

963
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:29,220
by multiple defenders we showed that the

964
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,440
the optimal and best response allocation

965
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,390
can be computed efficiently under

966
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,910
certain conditions for certain classes

967
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:39,089
of different strategies and currently we

968
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,790
are a sort of conducting case studies on

969
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,590
large you know Bloods much larger sizes

970
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,350
of network for example the I Triple E

971
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:49,920
300 bus power grid network and some

972
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,400
other specific cyber security situations

973
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,910
that are

974
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,309
is in distributed energy resources we

975
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,288
also are interested in looking at how

976
00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:01,049
the degree of interdependencies affect

977
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:02,579
the security of the system so we are

978
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:05,270
looking at certain classes of random

979
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,950
graphs on that and also some other

980
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:12,839
dynamic or moving target difference

981
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:15,089
techniques to conclude we looked at two

982
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:17,849
applications of game theory in network

983
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:19,920
security so first where we looked at the

984
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:21,900
the influence of behavioral perception

985
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,910
of probabilities on security investment

986
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,359
decisions in the second case we looked

987
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:29,098
at a more general framework where the

988
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,900
optimal different strategies can be

989
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:34,619
computed by solving a convex

990
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,740
optimization problem so in the area of

991
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:40,109
security and game theory is quite large

992
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,029
there have been multiple books on the

993
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,759
subjects of the two books listed here

994
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:48,480
are very sort of helpful to give a lot

995
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,609
of background and into this area there

996
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,319
are also area specific conferences for

997
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,690
example decision and game theory for

998
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,730
security workshop and economics of

999
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:59,549
information security and security and

1000
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:02,670
human behavior so if you are interested

1001
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:06,490
you can find more information in these

1002
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:12,900
venues so thank you

1003
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:12,899
[Applause]

1004
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:18,259
have you actually applied some of the

1005
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,989
game theory to some of the dollars

1006
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:27,199
involved in the risk consequences and

1007
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:31,489
cost of security investments so applied

1008
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:35,390
in the context of of a more sort of

1009
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:36,859
managerial decision making well let's

1010
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,069
let's pick for example on the electric

1011
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:41,930
utilities when you look at some of the

1012
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:45,920
options for investing in security and

1013
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,868
the consequence of something going wrong

1014
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,940
have you actually run numbers regarding

1015
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:52,670
the dollar amounts on it at all I know

1016
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,979
so most of our work is a is more

1017
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,910
analytical so we're trying to prove

1018
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:57,910
results and so on

1019
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:45,180
maybe then you cannot yeah small Network

1020
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:48,270
it might be okay there are large number

1021
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,339
of nodes and like each of the nodes also

1022
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:54,240
different and they get updates like

1023
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:57,840
every other day so how often do you

1024
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:02,160
calculate the equilibrium the Nash

1025
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,860
equilibrium so like is it done every

1026
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,890
time or like is there a method to like

1027
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:12,360
or appellate an optimum value and then

1028
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:14,100
just modify that value over time because

1029
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:19,020
you don't want to calculate it like all

1030
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:22,410
the time here so the how money I

1031
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:27,630
question here because they can't hear

1032
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:31,350
you can use asleep innovation okay all

1033
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:35,730
right sure so to my understanding I

1034
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:37,650
think that the question is that since

1035
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,540
the calculating the Nash equilibrium is

1036
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,750
an iterative process it can be

1037
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,310
inefficient if we need to calculate the

1038
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,070
Nash equilibrium every time there are

1039
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,950
some small changes in the network so

1040
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,650
even though it's an iterative process

1041
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,330
how many iteration it takes depends on

1042
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,280
the degree of inter connection so if

1043
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,360
their networks are pretty much by

1044
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,940
themselves and there are very few

1045
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,370
interconnections then it doesn't take

1046
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:07,170
many iterations to converge so in those

1047
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:10,020
cases it doesn't take too much time to

1048
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,570
compute these resources to give you give

1049
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,640
a specific example we looked at the I

1050
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,380
Triple E 300 bus network and we

1051
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,190
considered every bus to be a node and

1052
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,560
this graph has 300 nodes and around 800

1053
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:24,570
800 edges but the degree of

1054
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,150
interconnection is small so you know it

1055
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,100
that the iterative process converges to

1056
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,880
a Nash equilibrium ago in about you know

1057
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,910
between 20 to 50 iterations

1058
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,900
too and every iteration even when a

1059
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:43,098
small desktop computer takes it like

1060
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:47,470
less than a minute to find using a

1061
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:55,400
standard convex optimization solver CVX

1062
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:58,930
yeah thanks in your division then we

1063
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,930
ninjas thanks to thank you

1064
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,309
[Applause]

1065
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,529
you
