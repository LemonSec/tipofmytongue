1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,779
so hello everybody welcome to the

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,930
serious seminar the second and this

3
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:25,750
third in this semester so today we have

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,750
a professor gene camp from Indian I

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,400
density Bloomington she is a very well

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,040
known researcher in the usable security

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
and security economic field was done

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,339
tremendous work in all this field before

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,540
working at Indiana she was she was

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,489
working at she was his bent legs around

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,370
eight years at Howard where she was also

12
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,379
working the similar topics and so at

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,050
Carnegie Mellon before that and so she

14
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:57,190
spent one year in Sandia so quite a

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,620
elaborate career all throughout in

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,209
different interesting places so today

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,339
she is going to talk about the changing

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,570
economics in networks where we are going

19
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:06,070
to see some interesting interplay

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:12,550
between the economics networks and

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:16,408
security how many have you heard that

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:19,120
security is not a level playing field

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,399
that you have to change the game and

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,060
security so you never heard that the

25
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:27,670
idea that a defender has to patch every

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,240
vulnerability and an attacker only has

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:35,430
to get one vulnerability so the idea

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,579
that insecurity we have an unfair game

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,100
that you your defenders are always

30
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:45,939
playing as a lot as it were into the

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:49,179
wind so changing the game and economics

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,770
of insecurity has been a goal of the

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,109
Department of Homeland Security and the

34
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,689
Department of Defense for quite a long

35
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:59,350
time so want to talk to you about how we

36
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:04,000
use economics to change the entire game

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:07,329
and to make it possible for defenders to

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,860
win that is why we care about economics

39
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:16,750
of security so I am going to talk to you

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:20,470
about economics and then BGP as an

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,510
economic phenomenon I don't think many

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,409
of you have ever thought about route

43
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,370
updates as economic information right

44
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,010
that they really are

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:36,860
and then changing the economics of VJ

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:39,890
bgp and why bgp sec doesn't work so i'm

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:44,000
going to assume a fairly varied level of

48
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:48,379
a network security networking security

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,690
and economics so some of this you will

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:55,040
already know and some of it will be

51
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,019
entirely new so the thing about

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,230
economics and I'm going to talk to you

53
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,329
about markets and because if we want to

54
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,119
change the game using economics we have

55
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:08,140
to understand markets and some of these

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,239
have some pretty significant assumptions

57
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,700
well you have some pretty significant

58
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,209
assumptions to write you talk about ones

59
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:22,060
and zeros and step functions instead of

60
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:26,840
0 point 9 and 0 point 0 2 and I

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,640
exponential response curves so for the

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,590
market to work you have to understand

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:37,160
the assumptions of of the basic

64
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,440
economics this is just micra 101 but

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,660
everybody has assumptions right I mean

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,310
if you're the engineers in the room how

67
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,530
would you calculate the volume of a cat

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,780
well the engineer might put the cat

69
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,609
under water but only for a second and

70
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,590
not enough to hurt the cat but if the

71
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,359
cat's a fluffy cat that would not give

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,160
you very accurate information right

73
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,290
because you're reducing the volume of

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,989
the cat the mathematician would do the

75
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,048
most exact response but that would be

76
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,870
intractable I mean you just couldn't get

77
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:08,930
the cat to stand still and the physicist

78
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,209
might assume a spherical cat so I admit

79
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,090
there's a certain amount of assuming a

80
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,940
spherical cat in economics not in the

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,738
technical solution when we change bgp

82
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:25,280
but in the idea of economics of security

83
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:27,380
now if you have a market that actually

84
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,630
works you have to have three things

85
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,500
about the thing you're buying and

86
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,840
selling so one of those things is goods

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,820
have to be rival risk that is if I use

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,169
it you can't use it they have to be

89
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,180
excludable that means

90
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,460
I can prevent you from having it like

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,199
this some clicker and it has to be

92
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:50,599
transparent which means that you have

93
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:55,039
full information so there was a very

94
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:57,740
popular Android I security app that

95
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,080
secured your Android and I think its

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,310
name was veritas does anybody remember

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,020
this had five stars super popular google

98
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,389
took it off the market because all it

99
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,349
did was nothing it just made you feel

100
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:16,069
good yay I have a security on my android

101
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm so happy so we have problems with

102
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:21,740
all three of these in economics in

103
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,770
security so transparent also means low

104
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,740
search costs and ability to examine and

105
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,479
predict when you go buy a car you have

106
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,050
some idea of how much you're going to

107
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,460
drive right when you buy a house you

108
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,939
have a pretty good idea of who's going

109
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,469
to live there right but security and

110
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:45,199
privacy or goods that you only

111
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:46,819
experience when they fail and this is a

112
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,319
problem with security how do you know

113
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:54,319
your security works nothing happened

114
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,080
right this is a very unusual gun how do

115
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,120
you know you liked dinner it didn't it

116
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,188
didn't show up wait no that's not how

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,319
normal goods work so security is

118
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:09,499
problematic in terms of the market and

119
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:12,740
without without information the market

120
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:15,469
can't even works and this is one of my

121
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,210
favorite tweets from Matt blaze snake

122
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:21,339
oil is the secret ingredient that makes

123
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:24,198
one-time pad thai so delicious hmm so

124
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:27,740
now we have artificial intelligence I

125
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,349
mean I did you know I published in it we

126
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,259
did a deep neural networks paper to

127
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:37,430
detect rogue certificates and we had

128
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:39,560
excellent response curves once in the

129
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,680
middle layer in a deep neural network

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,580
algorithm we don't know right i mean if

131
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,990
you're using something standard like

132
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,508
random forest you can see the weights

133
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,009
but you're mostly buying antivirus

134
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,379
technologies that are not

135
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,080
difficult to observe if where they work

136
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,589
and fail but even the creators cannot

137
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,330
tell you what's in them so you can see

138
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,569
that there's some transparent markets

139
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,698
spam house is completely transparent

140
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:11,180
open code is completely transparent but

141
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:17,979
that did not stop go to fail did it does

142
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:21,649
everybody know what go to fail is okay

143
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,960
is everybody like awake cuz I asked this

144
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:26,360
is that was a yes or no question or a

145
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,159
yes or no depending on like I expect a

146
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,210
lot more head bobbling when I said that

147
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:34,580
all so that was Apple had a they

148
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,899
repeated the line go to fail twice which

149
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,198
meant that if the the link between the

150
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:45,499
key and the identity were not validated

151
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:49,639
and was accepted anyway basically so

152
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:51,649
that you know so long as you had had a

153
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,319
valid public key it didn't matter who

154
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:57,469
you claim to be like oh I have a key and

155
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,789
it says I'm Steve don't be confused it's

156
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:04,789
really I'm really me so I know what

157
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,789
about the test Suites we use for AV what

158
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:11,748
about the test Suites we use for malware

159
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:17,029
how do you know when why an app is taken

160
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:19,990
off of the stores for Apple or Google we

161
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:22,699
don't have a lot of transparency so

162
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,819
that's a problem in the market another

163
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,469
market is exclusion exclusion is when

164
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,110
you hear people say property is a

165
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:32,360
natural right when you're arguing when

166
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,979
you are you know arguing with

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,620
libertarians on the internet they'll be

168
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,089
like property is a state of nature this

169
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,469
is what they mean they mean that

170
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:45,740
exclusion is possible that I can lock my

171
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:49,130
door so do not trespass is the essential

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,800
nature of exclusion right but it can

173
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,040
create this lack of exclusion creates

174
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,939
distorted markets like a radio broadcast

175
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,649
are supported by ads we're so used to ad

176
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,260
supported radio that we don't even think

177
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,000
about paying for something in intention

178
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,930
span instead of money

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,610
but that is not your standard market why

180
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,189
don't we just means if you use it I

181
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:18,500
can't if and I use it you can't this is

182
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:22,100
my bottle of water it is excludable

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,590
because I can hold on to it it is rival

184
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,170
risk because once I drink it you cannot

185
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:32,630
drink it okay so that's the difference

186
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,880
it's either in consumption or non

187
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,620
divisibility and you can open a bottle

188
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,850
of water and pour it into multiple cups

189
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:45,920
so you can make something that is not

190
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,380
that is on rival risk less rival risk so

191
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,459
if you think of uber as time sharing

192
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,850
they took cars car ownership rate which

193
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,460
was rival risk if I own my car you

194
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,350
cannot use my car I mean this is not an

195
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,280
example I'm not letting you use my car I

196
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,780
like my car no offense um but they took

197
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,569
something that was whyville risk and

198
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:15,230
made it less so by making it divisible

199
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,810
okay so the cool things about them we

200
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,720
can get through that so the things that

201
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,109
we see high fixed cost zero marginal

202
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,040
cost once you write software how much

203
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:34,400
does that second copy of software costs

204
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:37,219
right so railroad tickets large i by i

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,339
meant nuclear electrical plants like

206
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,560
catawba electrical plant which is a Duke

207
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,770
plant so I don't know maybe they wheel

208
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,949
some of that energy out here railroad

209
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,230
tickets airplane tickets they use price

210
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,330
discrimination that's how you that's how

211
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,770
you price it routing announcements how

212
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,490
are you going to make routing

213
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:01,189
announcements excludable or rivalries

214
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,589
right because you can't give people to

215
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:08,030
invest in something if it's not

216
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:10,850
excludable or rivalries it causes things

217
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,709
it can limit economic power walmart

218
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,870
sells one out of every seven

219
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,400
toothbrushes in america but you know

220
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,440
they still have to pay for that next

221
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,649
toothbrush they don't reach a point at

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,589
what

223
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,959
their next toothbrush is free so that

224
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:27,259
creates competition it creates

225
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,079
incentives to invest and it creates a

226
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:35,089
return to investors and all those things

227
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,888
are awesome in contrast there's a thing

228
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,309
called public goods how many of you guys

229
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:45,470
have heard of the concept of publicans

230
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:49,160
yay okay so they're not excludable and

231
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,899
they're not rival risk so calculus when

232
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,618
you learn calculus did somebody else

233
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:57,290
have to forget it right it didn't work

234
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:59,600
that way open source you can you give it

235
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,599
away freely is software and what is

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,360
software is it a good well you know it's

237
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,079
it's a you can you can still buy a DVD

238
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,429
is when you bought when did you buy halo

239
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:17,959
when it came out right did you pay for

240
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:20,059
is it a service is it infrastructure so

241
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,439
all these things matter and if you can

242
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,969
make something that is infrastructure

243
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:28,399
into a good then you can get more

244
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,800
investment in the private sector if you

245
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,749
make something that was a good into

246
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,540
infrastructure then you can get a lot of

247
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:37,970
complementary growth right so the

248
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,860
difference between a closed and open

249
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,800
network all right so there's different

250
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,499
types of goods there's Club goods which

251
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,128
are excludable and non Ryan will risk

252
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:51,620
that is um I can let you in the gym you

253
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,480
can have a gym membership and it's not

254
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,749
really rival Russ until it gets too

255
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,860
crowded okay there are public guns which

256
00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:02,749
are normal guns and I mean which are you

257
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,470
know national defense is the canonical

258
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:08,360
public good a lighthouse is a canonical

259
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,879
public good you can't put up a

260
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,860
lighthouse and everybody but you can use

261
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,490
this lighthouse but when your boats out

262
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,829
there and not you dude sorry you're just

263
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,869
going to have to sail with hope it just

264
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,388
doesn't work that way you can't national

265
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:25,850
defense is another canonical public good

266
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:29,139
I can't say we're going to divest in

267
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,880
infants um you know America will be safe

268
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,800
except your house sorry about that just

269
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,870
your house you can't exclude people from

270
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,990
these things and it's not rhyme or wrist

271
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,510
it's not like oh well I'm consuming more

272
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,560
photons from the lighthouse than you are

273
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:48,530
and doesn't work like that so these are

274
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,959
our classical types of goods

275
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,550
non-excludable fisheries or an example

276
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,940
because its rival risk because if I

277
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,010
catch the fish guess what you don't

278
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,120
catch the fish but it's very hard to

279
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,430
exclude someone from the ocean right I

280
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,800
mean maybe you could so what does that

281
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,560
matter in economics well there's a

282
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,930
booming firewalls market in fact the

283
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,930
next-generation firewalls market is

284
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,660
supposed is the subject of like a garden

285
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,520
or report every quarter because they're

286
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,100
so excited and how much money you can

287
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,520
make and firewalls right firewalls I by

288
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,580
the firewall it value is excludable by

289
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,850
definition you do not get value from my

290
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,240
firewall I can you know you're not using

291
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,450
my firewall email you can add people to

292
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,390
email you can copy email around any but

293
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,820
everybody as we have seen in the last

294
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,930
six months can read the same persons

295
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,850
email once in this year on

296
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,219
non-excludable i can use an IP address

297
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,770
lets you know this is a generalization

298
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,030
assuming known adding that i can

299
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:02,540
announce let's say if i announce a / 24

300
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:05,000
that's it you can't announce it right so

301
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,890
its rival risk but i cannot stop you

302
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,560
from announcing it either and the

303
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,650
ability the fact that i cannot stop you

304
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,089
from announcing IP addresses is at the

305
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:22,970
core of this talk and bgp updates and

306
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:26,720
security are public goods okay so we can

307
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,240
change this by design we can move

308
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,440
fishing detection and incident data into

309
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,350
excludable rival risk guns by having

310
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,940
timing right it's you can't exclude

311
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,850
somebody from knowledge of a fishing

312
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,150
site but I can I can get to it faster

313
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,510
and I can have a more complete set so I

314
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,199
can create a good

315
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,050
and that is rival risk I can make

316
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:55,620
incident data private I can protect the

317
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:58,189
data so we're sure so the tragedy of the

318
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,830
Commons is when there's no clear

319
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,490
resource people over exploit it right

320
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:09,920
national defense clean air clean water

321
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:14,790
we massively over over produce carbon at

322
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:18,750
terrible levels and we have no routing

323
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,780
security people have not invested so I'm

324
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,550
going to talk about this for you I have

325
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,560
like another half an hour right I'm

326
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,719
going to talk about another example for

327
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,140
two minutes on the basis that we're all

328
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,030
in education right we all understand

329
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,600
education then I'm going to talk about

330
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:41,760
BGP hijacking and how we have turned it

331
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:44,580
in to a different kind of good okay all

332
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,860
right so education is a public good

333
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,720
you're getting an education you might

334
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,510
start a business you're going to pay

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,480
more taxes you're less likely to be in

336
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:58,250
jail these are all things that any

337
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:03,090
person gets from an education you cannot

338
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:05,730
exclude me from that benefit we're all

339
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,569
in the same economy if you're paying

340
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:13,860
more taxes if you are employing people

341
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:15,720
it's all good this is a shared good so

342
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:19,560
public investment is necessary education

343
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,550
is a multi-generational club good that

344
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,339
is why we like alumni hmm alumni give

345
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,859
scholarships they give money

346
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,210
universities there is an issue of

347
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,760
oversubscription which includes

348
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,270
congestion in the class how many of you

349
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,100
been unable to get into a class yes it's

350
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,830
not that in that way it's not a public

351
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,189
good because you are excluded and it's

352
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:46,919
intertemporal education is a private

353
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,690
good it is a labor market signal you

354
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,450
will pay more taxes because you will

355
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,270
make a lot more money and you are not

356
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,400
going to give me or anybody else any of

357
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,370
that money it's your money you earned it

358
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,500
it's yours congratulate

359
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:09,330
in advance okay so how you think about

360
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,370
something matters so in I you in 1980

361
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,030
you had to work at minimum wage for

362
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,679
weeks to pay for your tuition so four

363
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,610
weeks of full-time labour you hear this

364
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:25,140
in two thousand you had to to work you

365
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:29,429
know eight eight weeks right you had to

366
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:33,210
work more and now you have to work like

367
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:35,400
35 weeks to pay tuition and minimum wage

368
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,610
and that means like you couldn't live

369
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,679
indoors maybe you could buy a car I'm in

370
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,909
the corner but these are three models of

371
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:47,820
goods in 1980 education was a public

372
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,650
good by 2000 it was considered a club

373
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,600
good and now it's considered a private

374
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,170
good that you purchased how many of you

375
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,020
heard that your consumers of education

376
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:02,790
that the student is the consumer this is

377
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:06,030
the model of good as opposed to you know

378
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:09,540
a student being a scholar so it matters

379
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,309
how we think about things and in and the

380
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,649
goal of that was to explain the kind of

381
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,350
goods they are and to show you that it

382
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,290
matters in your life how we consider

383
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,459
different kinds of goods so what does

384
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:26,309
this have to do with browning ready for

385
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,230
that part the rounding part it is how

386
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:33,330
many bgp how many people are familiar

387
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:35,250
with bgp okay so it's interesting i get

388
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,510
about the same number of yeses for every

389
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,260
question but they come from different

390
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,750
parts of the room so it's used by ISPs

391
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:47,340
to exchange network connectivity it was

392
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:50,250
released in 1995 in 1995 only

393
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,250
governments and educational institutions

394
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,840
were allowed on the internet and

395
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,370
commerce on the internet was prohibited

396
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,770
by law because it would have been

397
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,870
basically stealing government resources

398
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:06,750
in fact in 1995 in most countries the

399
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:12,419
internet was not even legal in ireland

400
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:13,140
the PT the public the postal telephone

401
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,760
and telegraph

402
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,920
everything was owned by the government

403
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,240
right so this postal service the

404
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:25,560
telephone service so if you connect in a

405
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:29,340
modem to the i telephone company you are

406
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:34,260
committing treason right so this was

407
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:36,030
when BGP was designed and every BGP

408
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,370
participant is given an autonomous

409
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,889
system number and each autonomous system

410
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,649
advertises networks that can ask answer

411
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:48,840
it is an amazing piece of engineering it

412
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:52,500
has proven hugely resilient on lemme see

413
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:57,060
September 11 2001 the internet was back

414
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,790
online in two minutes the major there

415
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,280
were floors of the World Trade Center

416
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,899
that were routing that we're just

417
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,000
rounding centers there were people

418
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,780
running across rooms with bundles of

419
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,520
fiber and it was back up and fully

420
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,730
connected within two minutes the

421
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,520
telephone network state congestion

422
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,380
staying congested for almost a day is

423
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,440
inaccessible for day the next day people

424
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,060
were getting voicemails so but it's not

425
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,820
authenticated and there's no integrity

426
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,560
check what does that mean well that

427
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,710
means there can be data exfiltration

428
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,409
here is my high level overview of what a

429
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,690
BGP hijacked us take these codes to the

430
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:39,240
president okay but I'm going to stop at

431
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,520
dr. Evil's headquarters on the way there

432
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,970
is no way to stop that now if dr. evil

433
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,590
wants to hijack your BGP your hijack

434
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,290
your traffic's and then all your traffic

435
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:54,810
goes through dr. evil dr. evil can

436
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:57,360
probably do that she is really evil okay

437
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,940
so hijacks why do people do hijacked

438
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,520
well it's linked to spam right the

439
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,460
people hijack its X sections of IP

440
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,300
address and use it to spam because

441
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,810
they're spammers so their IP address is

442
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,240
blacklisted right so these are short

443
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,450
hype and these are papers that have

444
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,770
shown this deep packet inspection has

445
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,110
been linked to political unrest so and

446
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,000
malware has been linked to both deep

447
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,340
packet inspection

448
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,040
into hijacks and failures so I want to

449
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,169
give you some examples of hijacks why do

450
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,000
you know so one of the things that the

451
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,710
first question an engineer asked about

452
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,650
hijacks is why would you hijack a

453
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,920
perfectly good system right why would

454
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,230
anybody go after bgp you know it's like

455
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,920
going after sun shines and national

456
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:56,320
parks so if bitcoin everybody knows from

457
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,960
bitcoin is right yeah i got full nons um

458
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,419
you know the miners because it's based

459
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,460
on hash values you don't want to be

460
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:10,340
trying to generate a Bitcoin I by

461
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,820
yourself you want to be part of a large

462
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,879
pool and share results because that's

463
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,860
the way probability works right so one

464
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,250
person cannot be an effective Bitcoin

465
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,030
miner what they have is mining pools and

466
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:29,600
pools run ironically threw a centralized

467
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:34,430
server right so what happened is Bitcoin

468
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:38,209
heist is that this is this asn sixty-six

469
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:41,630
cents at amazon cloud so they had an

470
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,340
amazon cloud collaborative server space

471
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,480
and what happened was when one of the

472
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:50,209
miners found a hash collision so that

473
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,660
they can extend the ledger extend the

474
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:58,360
chain and get the money they report it

475
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:01,310
to the cnc server right so here we are

476
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:06,800
we all know which place to go to to

477
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:11,899
report our our results unless somebody

478
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:17,990
in canada lies about where amazon is so

479
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:20,150
they had on 15-minute burst we're just

480
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,840
everybody who tried to connect to the

481
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:28,250
amazon cloud server that was the Bitcoin

482
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:33,470
mining pool right went to canada telecom

483
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:36,290
instead now bgp path policies could have

484
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,520
presented prevented the heist is very

485
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,940
hard to get bgp path policy

486
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,950
they and even if just one minor had

487
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,410
noticed they could have won the whole

488
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,990
pool but because they're a bunch of you

489
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,190
know they're there this is what they do

490
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,960
they calculate hash values on their

491
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,470
computing they don't mostly know what

492
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:04,140
bgp is many of them are speculators

493
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:07,920
effectively and they did not notice the

494
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,410
the police noticed so denver to denver

495
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,860
this is an example of an of another

496
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,990
hijack so connection between two isps in

497
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,270
denver was routed through Iceland

498
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,250
because I know when I want to grow

499
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,780
across town in Denver I take an

500
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:26,280
international flight to raise Irving

501
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:31,800
every time no wait makes no sense but it

502
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:35,129
was undetected for four months so attack

503
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,980
was it only poisoned some part of the

504
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,890
internet like even if you had a very

505
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,650
good view of the internet from say

506
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:46,440
Washington DC it would not have been

507
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,640
visible to you so there was a similar

508
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:55,350
attack that took Mexico to data to DC

509
00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:00,480
via Belarus so all US Mexican diplomatic

510
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:02,610
traffic went through Belarus again these

511
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,340
are a long term so why Denver what's

512
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,649
near Denver and these are organizations

513
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,800
that were hijacked and did not notice

514
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:14,340
for a significant time period this is

515
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,010
not easy to automatically detect right

516
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,379
so Cheyenne Mountain do you guys know

517
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,480
what Cheyenne Mountain is is that

518
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:27,060
there's a war games anybody ever watched

519
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,310
war games no okay well was in the midst

520
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:34,050
okay movie yeah watch it you know it's

521
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:37,679
probably on netflix the NSA signal

522
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,990
intelligence nor read us NORTHCOM the

523
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,350
Air Force Academy Buckley and Peterson

524
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,350
Air Force bases so there is

525
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,600
there was is not visible from most

526
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,669
vantage points right because once you

527
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,709
send your traffic on the network it just

528
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:00,340
goes wherever it goes to on the network

529
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:03,730
I give if dr. evil wants it to come past

530
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,309
her lab it won't come past her lab so

531
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:10,419
here's a picture because I think this is

532
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:14,649
particularly impressive so 1 and 12 are

533
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:18,070
Denver Colorado it was undetected

534
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:23,110
because the path went all the way around

535
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:26,168
it's not like when that second tier tier

536
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:29,039
2 ISP accidentally took Australia off

537
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:33,039
the internet for for like 12 hours

538
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:38,710
because the traffic just died or when

539
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:41,770
that poor woman in southern Russia was

540
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:46,210
out looking for scratching for metal and

541
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:48,370
dug up a huge copper length and it turns

542
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,070
out all that was how the southern

543
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:55,000
Ukraine I connected to the internet

544
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,220
right so this is quite an impressive

545
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,039
hijack and it went on for a considerable

546
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:06,090
amount of time so how r hijacks

547
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:11,799
performed it just leverages BGP it looks

548
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:14,740
identical to recovery like how does BGP

549
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:18,370
recover from an anomaly so if the best

550
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,700
way to get from me to you is to go one

551
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,590
two three four hops and then you leave

552
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,530
there's something called you know a

553
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,530
little routing storm and it might

554
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:32,049
temporarily go oh here here here here

555
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,720
here here here here here but then it

556
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:37,110
will settle to hear hear hear right so I

557
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,549
mean it's it's indistinguishable from

558
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,030
from recovery and it's indistinguishable

559
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:46,570
from mistakes people make mistakes all

560
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,970
the time in network engineering and what

561
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,730
it and it takes a global context or

562
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,419
global investment for security oh man I

563
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,770
can't believe I'm misspelled security

564
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,500
defenders only have local context all I

565
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,980
can see is that it's going to you I

566
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,880
don't

567
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:08,500
which Pathan is taking after this really

568
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:13,059
so how do you do um a BGP route you say

569
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:17,620
all right here let's say a s4 wants to

570
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:24,360
go to s 1 and s 3 and s 1 unconnected oh

571
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:28,659
no there was a somebody pick a disaster

572
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:31,928
give me a disaster any disaster there

573
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,910
was a tornado very appropriate very

574
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:37,179
regionally appropriate there's a tornado

575
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:41,290
and it's not and it's not connected

576
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:46,510
anymore so what do we do we um we go

577
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:48,639
through a s2 right look sometimes

578
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,770
there's not a tornado na s to just

579
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,490
totally wants to hijack your traffic it

580
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,639
looks the same way the very resilience

581
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:01,330
that has made a protocol designed in

582
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:06,700
1995 the core infrastructure makes

583
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:10,540
hijacking easy yes was the link to in

584
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:14,770
select all I'm sorry to denver denver

585
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,840
down no to to Iceland was it all fiber I

586
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,150
mean could they have pinged it in this

587
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,918
discern that there was a longer like

588
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,130
time that I should have it they could

589
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:27,130
have looked at time to live so detecting

590
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:30,250
bgp hijacks there are three approaches

591
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,980
there's a control plane approach which

592
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,080
is what we are looking at but our

593
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,049
solution doesn't depend on it there is a

594
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,909
data plane approach which is the control

595
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:45,940
plane approached looks at path link and

596
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:49,360
path jenner like okay this path has been

597
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,710
stable forever so I'm sorry I keep

598
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,689
kicking you out of the room done ticket

599
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,630
person and so you leave but suddenly

600
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,410
instead of going to one two three four

601
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:05,070
five six it goes one two three four five

602
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:07,750
six so that's a distance so that so the

603
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,600
information theoretic distance between

604
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:13,779
two paths and then there's a data plane

605
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,539
approach where you look at delays

606
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:18,599
and time to live and then there are

607
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:23,889
approaches that combine the two of those

608
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:27,070
we looked at these this results looked

609
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:28,570
at jurisdiction because it's research

610
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,099
and nobody's looked at jurisdiction

611
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:37,359
before but we found that by combining

612
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:40,629
jurisdiction and path topology so

613
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:44,830
control plane and geographical

614
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:48,039
information we have a pretty we I feel

615
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,839
that we have good results but they

616
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,239
haven't been published yet because we

617
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,109
haven't finished writing those up so I

618
00:31:52,239 --> 00:32:01,869
can't confirm that my peers also believe

619
00:31:56,109 --> 00:32:06,099
we have to so again we see the same

620
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:11,349
thing we have hijacking so a Stas to

621
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:15,908
sends out a / 28 so / and then they're

622
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:18,309
targeting some subset of a s4 so / 28 is

623
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:23,139
added to the round table because more

624
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:26,589
specific and then it's exactly a hijack

625
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:31,689
so it's a growing problem or is it all

626
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:33,908
criminals is it about making money is it

627
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,369
a bunch of incompetents who just

628
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:42,479
literally cannot route their way out of

629
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:46,149
a sub network or art is it all spies so

630
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:48,039
it's it it there was an argument for a

631
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:50,379
while that it was not increasing because

632
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,599
Argus has publicly available data on

633
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:54,939
mount hijacks based on data and control

634
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,739
planes but if you look at that Dana it

635
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,849
turns out if you just take some months

636
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:03,580
out it's not really decreasing it is

637
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:06,609
increasing so this is the timestamp of

638
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,668
their data so I argued that it is

639
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:13,210
increasing although there's not a lot of

640
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:17,950
information and is it political or

641
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:21,070
criminal well um these are hijacked hot

642
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,710
spots from our analysis so how many of

643
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:27,100
you have ever seen a map of the fiber

644
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:30,070
infrastructure of the world

645
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,610
okay yeah do you see this ring so first

646
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:37,299
of all this is djibouti and it is very

647
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:39,969
close there so all of this traffic goes

648
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:43,090
either through Turkey or through Africa

649
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:47,530
and if it goes through Africa it goes to

650
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:51,250
the US here there's a cable from the

651
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,629
Ivory Coast and Liberia so there's a lot

652
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:57,000
of cables from Liberia and the ivory

653
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:59,679
coast djibouti is a a major center for

654
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,350
telecommunications there's an IXP there

655
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,559
because of geography and like these two

656
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:08,080
chamorro they just have lazy data let's

657
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,929
be honest that some World Bank data when

658
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,020
you look at smaller nations it's just

659
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:19,200
all over the map it just I mean you want

660
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,199
to say that World Bank data provides

661
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:26,700
consistent biases or consistent errors

662
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,699
but when you start getting too small

663
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:34,810
small countries that are not very

664
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,510
economically stable those numbers are

665
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:40,449
just like very unreliable so there are

666
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:45,429
two things you can see here you can see

667
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:48,339
it you can see the the fiber networks

668
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,050
across the world and you can see two

669
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:54,040
places where I don't believe the world

670
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:55,780
data well Bank data so all we saw a lot

671
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,430
of information if you're used to

672
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,040
clustering I think we all see two

673
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:04,480
clusters there in this snowman there's

674
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:08,950
dis clustered and this cluster so we

675
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:13,859
found evidence for crime which is the

676
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,089
big cluster and we found evidence for in

677
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:20,350
intelligence activity all these

678
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,080
countries are engaged in warfare or

679
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:25,180
active violent civil dispute not like

680
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,799
people marching and pink hats but like

681
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:34,960
people shooting at each other and the

682
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:38,710
and bombers in aircraft involved so

683
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,480
question yes so what does the full dot

684
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,119
empty dot and

685
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,330
oh I'm sorry an empty dot means few

686
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,340
anomalies so this is the this is the hot

687
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,500
spot that we thought was weird this is a

688
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,900
world governance indicator which is role

689
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:57,790
of law and this is secure Internet

690
00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,220
servers so yes there are places that

691
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,270
literally report we have a dozen secure

692
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:10,868
internet servers and you're very proud

693
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:13,210
so all right so hijacking remember since

694
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,250
false connectivity information and a

695
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,290
route leak is an unintentional miss

696
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,090
configuration that causes a BGP

697
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:22,270
participants and incorrect and

698
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,910
connectivity information they both can

699
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,980
have the same result there's a moniker

700
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:30,399
for this has anybody heard this fat

701
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,280
fingers like which is completely stupid

702
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,290
because the human hand is the same size

703
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,750
as it always was like if you look at

704
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:40,300
Michelangelo you know on the Sistine

705
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,790
camp it's the same hand if you look at

706
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,550
the keyboard people just have not

707
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:48,970
changed that much so it's actually bad

708
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:52,660
usability design you know fingers should

709
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,850
still work so there are some proposed

710
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,368
solutions to this one is we can have a

711
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:00,580
resource public key infrastructure which

712
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:03,340
validates the origin or we can have BGP

713
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,940
sec which provides full path validation

714
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:09,070
so it's a cryptographic association

715
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,490
between network and origin and only

716
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,560
prevent certain classes of BGP attacks

717
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:18,270
Bitcoin would not have worked so it

718
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,619
makes sense for Amazon to adoptive right

719
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:23,259
but it doesn't make sense for most

720
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:25,210
places to adopt this do you have a like

721
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,490
a local little telephone we have like

722
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:30,420
Smithfield telephony and Bloomington do

723
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:35,169
you have something like that okay a

724
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:37,840
third telefe okay so it doesn't make

725
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,980
sense for like Comcast to adopt this it

726
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,410
would cost them a huge amount of money

727
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:48,190
who would it benefit maybe other people

728
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:51,180
but not Comcast and Denver would still

729
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:54,099
have worked because it turns out and

730
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,149
this is shocking to many cryptographers

731
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,670
and i've got to say i love

732
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,509
cryptographers many cryptographers are a

733
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,920
friend of mine an untrustworthy

734
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:06,249
autonomous system with a certificate is

735
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,859
still untrustworthy just like an

736
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:12,129
untrustworthy website with a public key

737
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:16,319
certificate is still untrustworthy so

738
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,819
BGP sec offers full path validation and

739
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:25,089
identifies trusted connections between

740
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:30,729
each AAS which means that everybody has

741
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:34,089
to adopt it it is very expensive and it

742
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:36,489
requires updating the entire public

743
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:38,769
infrastructure so let's think about the

744
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:42,729
coordination cost of that if all I

745
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:45,368
wanted all I want in right now in the

746
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:48,339
world was for every one of you to shift

747
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:49,960
one seat to the left I have 20 minutes

748
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:51,400
left it would take the whole 20 minutes

749
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,589
to get everybody's shift one seat to the

750
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,499
left and that's not even infrastructure

751
00:38:53,589 --> 00:39:00,219
that's a tiny coordination problem this

752
00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:02,319
is an immense coordination problem okay

753
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:06,489
this is a coordination problem of at

754
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:09,759
least hundreds of billions of dollars so

755
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:13,989
and the first person that adopts BGP

756
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:16,569
sank gets nothing because nobody else is

757
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:18,670
adopted in I you know so it's like

758
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:20,769
saying you know picking one of you and

759
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,269
say all right so i really want everybody

760
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:24,729
to stand on one foot so i'm going to ask

761
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:26,348
you to stand on one foot for the next 20

762
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,569
minutes to see if we can get other

763
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:30,069
people to stand on one foot because if

764
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:32,229
we all took turns standing on one foot

765
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:35,288
during all our talks we'd have better

766
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:38,379
balance right and everybody wants better

767
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:40,289
balance rain how likely is that going to

768
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,930
happen in this talk it will not happen

769
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:48,579
so one of the ways we did it is we

770
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:52,450
looked at assen jurisdiction we looked

771
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:56,769
at their looked at they're where they're

772
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,960
from right basically traffic starting

773
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,729
and ending within a jurisdiction

774
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,700
normally does not have a path that

775
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:04,899
leaves that jurisdiction what are cases

776
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,990
where this would have identified

777
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,780
problems well there was the Ukrainian

778
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,089
and grid controllers right did you read

779
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:19,060
about the Ukrainian power grid being

780
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:21,730
taken down yeah that is a sometimes the

781
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,190
evil can be really beautiful because

782
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:29,470
it's just so well done that the

783
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:33,310
Ukrainian hack was um a long term attack

784
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:36,390
by I attackers who were based in Russia

785
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:42,940
that brought down the power grid in

786
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:45,430
eastern in eastern Ukraine and they

787
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,210
locked the operators out of their own

788
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:51,279
power grid so but if you didn't

789
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,369
jurisdictional analysis the attackers

790
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,950
were in Russia and the Democratic email

791
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,600
servers rain that attack was from

792
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,750
actually it was they didn't even bother

793
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:08,618
with AES right they just used a dot are

794
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:10,750
you attack okay so each asn belongs to

795
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:14,350
an organization most of which are ISPs

796
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:17,530
someone which are on content delivery

797
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:20,470
networks and they're all subject to the

798
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:26,350
laws and they're real real differences

799
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:32,040
in those so how I'm going to skip this

800
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:36,339
um so one of the things people do now is

801
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:40,600
they may have well-known IP addresses

802
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:45,010
that they block there are big parts of

803
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:50,850
the internet that block the Nigerian IP

804
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:54,060
space because it is very hard to prevent

805
00:41:50,850 --> 00:42:00,630
social engineering fraud and there's a

806
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:05,410
419 advance fee fron you know that is

807
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:09,280
that was in Nigeria the second largest

808
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:13,868
source of foreign currency second only

809
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,369
to oil higher than agriculture right so

810
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:20,650
one way you can just say is we're just

811
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:21,880
going to block this IP space but if you

812
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,340
just block I piece

813
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,320
case you lose availability indiana

814
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:30,070
university is not going to blunt

815
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,650
nigerian IP space i mean there are

816
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:35,530
potential students there there may be

817
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:39,610
alumni there I mean I you know we're

818
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:42,280
just not going to do it and it also you

819
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,830
know if you just lose availability you

820
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,100
change network availability you lose

821
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:51,160
network availability for confidentiality

822
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,470
so suppose we said we're not going to

823
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,810
just pick places and block them because

824
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:58,330
that's that's problematic but we are

825
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:01,810
going to look for changes in country and

826
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:04,299
then blanc when that happens so what we

827
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:07,060
did is we took the 50 largest banks and

828
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,880
we looked at what would happen if we

829
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,950
change their jurisdiction so this is the

830
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,950
system we built this is what Bongo does

831
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:17,379
you know Kwan guy is a router and quagga

832
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:19,480
is also a member of the Antelope family

833
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,930
and it was named quagga because before

834
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:27,040
it there was something named zebra so we

835
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:30,370
named ours Bongo because bongos all

836
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,350
bongos have horns right so they were

837
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,600
there in the antelope or all of them

838
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,160
have horns like even little bongos have

839
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:40,900
forms as soon as they're born they're

840
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,029
like so take these launch codes through

841
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,950
the president sure but I'm going to stop

842
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:50,290
at dr. Evil's headquarters on the way

843
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:52,569
our our our code our system Bongo allows

844
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:55,900
you to say nevermind we'll just hold on

845
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:59,400
to these information until you know you

846
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,410
take dr. Evil's lab out of the loop ok

847
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,080
that's what that is what we've done and

848
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:08,649
the code is available as open code on

849
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:12,100
line called Bongo so you can actually

850
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:14,590
have any arbitrary route acceptance

851
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,270
criteria right now we have it built with

852
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,840
jurisdiction which is pretty innovative

853
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:23,560
if I say so myself we are looking at

854
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:27,310
Piron Alice we're looking at path

855
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,500
information you can also do peer

856
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,080
reputation so one of the things is if

857
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,150
you want to talk about the BGP incidents

858
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,529
that occur because of in competence that

859
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:40,240
is

860
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:43,660
trading in a fairly small number of ISPs

861
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,959
there is a distribution of competence

862
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:50,799
across autonomous systems as I'm sure

863
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,910
you are not shocked to find out right so

864
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,060
like everything else so we have a system

865
00:44:53,910 --> 00:45:00,580
bongo that tanks I information and we

866
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:03,549
and the data I'm telling you about now

867
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:07,210
is jurisdictional data we also have path

868
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:12,070
analyses data and it can fling three

869
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:15,220
things right it can offer open flow

870
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:19,330
rules all right which is nice because

871
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:23,109
sdn still is on top of bgp and for all

872
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:25,569
the excitement about sdn i do not

873
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:28,870
believe in a st in future I believe in a

874
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:30,430
hybrid future right in fact I don't have

875
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:35,100
to believe in a hybrid future there

876
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:39,129
already is with data networks it can I

877
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:41,319
refuse to change an individual route

878
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,290
information which you can do now but you

879
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,200
don't control it over the network or it

880
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:49,000
can fling out access control it can

881
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,450
change your access control list it can

882
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,310
fling out firewall rules so that what

883
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,339
happens when you see something

884
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:00,880
suspicious is going by dr. louisville's

885
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,830
at labs you can just say mmm not right

886
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,710
now there's going to be a delay in

887
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:09,700
transmission until the route appears to

888
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:12,040
normalize now there is a because you're

889
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,520
looking at it from an individual vantage

890
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,410
point there is a route diffusion period

891
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:23,230
where you are at risk right so your

892
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:26,740
routing table is at the moment you get

893
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,480
up and head out of the room his routing

894
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:32,229
table is still going to point to you

895
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:37,870
right so before it points before it

896
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:41,080
shifts they'll still be a risk so what

897
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:43,690
we did is we looked at 50 financial the

898
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,130
50 largest financial services because we

899
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,780
thought if you're a criminal what do

900
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,390
they say why do you rob banks that's

901
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,000
where the money is if I want

902
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,799
to rob banks I would do it this way

903
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,640
there is no way I would go into a bank

904
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:00,820
I'm not robbing any banks but were I to

905
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,279
engage in such activity which I will not

906
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:09,040
ever in my life this would be the way to

907
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:12,000
do it so I one of them dropped off the

908
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,000
internet completely

909
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,740
you
