00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,750
of colleagues coming to visit us and our

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,349
main speaker is gonna be mr. Vinson

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,690
yuria Vince is a computer engineer and

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:38,349
the principal member of technical staff

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,260
in Sandhya's cyber analysis research

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,020
development department he has made major

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,570
contributions to Sandhya's cyber defense

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,790
programs especially in the simulation of

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,190
complex networks in developing

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,860
innovative cybersecurity methods and the

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,870
in designing exercise scenarios that

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,360
test the limits of current network

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,519
security this work is helping Sandhya's

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,710
customers anticipate current and

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,239
emerging security threats and make

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,610
critical decisions about their

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,619
investments Vince and his team used

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,929
technologies to conduct cyber defense

24
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,060
exercise in partnership with the US

25
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:14,890
Department of Defense and to support

26
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,440
national security in collaboration with

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,350
colleagues and other US Department of

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,319
Energy National Labs DoD National Labs

29
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:30,610
as well as the US military without

30
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:33,880
further ado thanks so my name is William

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,470
Hart and before Vince gives his his

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,020
technical talk about the cybersecurity

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,819
work at Sandia we thought that we would

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,190
provide some background about Sandia and

35
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,259
show you a brief video that provides

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,690
some context about what's it like to

37
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:48,819
work at the labs so Sandia is the

38
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,599
largest of the Department of Energy's

39
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:54,509
National Laboratories historically it's

40
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,530
been responsible principally for

41
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,360
engineering and maintaining the safety

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,160
of nuclear weapons but in the last

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,200
couple decades Sandhya's mission has

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,420
evolved to support a very wide range of

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,849
national security programs for the US

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,800
government one of which is supporting

47
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,509
that cybersecurity through a variety of

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,380
different programs for DHS the

49
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,359
Department of Defense

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,239
and for the Department of Energy as well

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,879
so without with that I'll show you a

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,329
quick video and we can proceed to

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,328
Vince's talk

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,390
[Music]

55
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,629
so what drew me to Sandia was the idea

56
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,548
of really working for a mission I really

57
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,230
wanted a career where I felt like I

58
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,750
could be improving the world in some way

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,340
and with Sandhya's mission focus on

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,139
national security and I think that we

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,599
really had the opportunity to have an

62
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,040
impact broader than just within the

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,369
laboratory but actually have some global

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
impact as well personally I think with

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,379
regard to the mission work I think

66
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,339
there's a tremendous amount of pride and

67
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:59,388
value in knowing that you're

68
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,370
contributing to a large infrastructure

69
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:06,000
our mission is exceptional service in

70
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,889
the national interest it helps make my

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,290
community safer it makes my country

72
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,329
safer it makes me want to work harder

73
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,000
because I know it actually impacts

74
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:17,310
people's lives so we do work in terms of

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,129
chemical biological defense disaster

76
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,069
preparedness of course nuclear weapons

77
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:24,569
radiological detection cybersecurity and

78
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,000
just a whole host of different problems

79
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,518
you see the impact of your work on a

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,220
daily basis the work that we do is

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,079
tremendous and it is underpinning a lot

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,069
of the national security and our safety

83
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,329
so I'm proud to be a part of that

84
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:42,599
contributions that I make are directly

85
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:45,209
related to tangible things that relate

86
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,159
to the nation I've been able to have a

87
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,049
lot of freedom to pursue the type of

88
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,760
work that I find that you see at the

89
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,650
laboratory I'm always being given the

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,569
opportunity to address a new challenge

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,900
answer a new problem work for a new

92
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:01,198
sponsor and learn new things it's

93
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,540
important to be able to evolve because

94
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,880
you change your interests change your

95
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,670
strengths develop

96
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,120
sandhya provides the flexibility to

97
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,089
adjust to every twist and turn I'm

98
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,950
excited about working here because

99
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:22,099
personally I'm very motivated by

100
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,740
learning new things and also solving

101
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,870
problems particularly problems that have

102
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,830
significant impact and in this

103
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,650
environment I have a very rich set of

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:38,870
R&D problems that I can work on and try

105
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:41,210
to solve we get to play with the newest

106
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,190
greatest technologies we get to

107
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,930
integrate technologies from various

108
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:50,600
areas into the national security realm

109
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,790
I've seen some of my work be deployed

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,760
around the world and it's humbling and

111
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,680
it's amazing experience to do have the

112
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,550
opportunity to contribute to a solution

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,350
that that has such widespread effect the

114
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,990
sheer amount of talent that we have it's

115
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,750
India's stacker we get to work with

116
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,970
great colleagues who are experts in

117
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,560
their fields so really it's about

118
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,480
blending from different backgrounds

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,540
different skill sets and really finding

120
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,250
that right team being able to come here

121
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,530
to Sandia and feel part of a larger

122
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,950
community was it was a big deal to me

123
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,929
from the get-go I felt like people knew

124
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,030
who I was were interested to know my

125
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,470
background but more importantly wanted

126
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,940
to integrate me into the team very

127
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:37,160
quickly I really liked the focus of

128
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,380
professional development and how much

129
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Sandhya invests in early career

130
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,260
professionals it's hard to replicate the

131
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,830
stability the benefits that you get from

132
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,830
working here I feel like I determine my

133
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,320
destiny I determine my success if you're

134
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,210
interested in a rewarding career working

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,650
with great folks cutting-edge technology

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,810
than Sandhya is a place that you should

137
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,969
strongly consider if you want to go

138
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,890
somewhere and be in an environment where

139
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,750
you can talk to world leaders and all

140
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,729
the experts in a variety of fields as

141
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,950
well as really be challenged yourself

142
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,770
technically I mean scientifically I

143
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,990
think Sandhya is a tremendous

144
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,849
ways to do it you know I feel like an

145
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,430
important member of the team I feel like

146
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,219
I'm contributing to my country and it's

147
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,680
a great feeling to come to work I want

148
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,080
the world's greatest and brightest minds

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,379
here so that we can work together and

150
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,448
come up with new better solutions the

151
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,060
reason I get up every morning to come to

152
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,539
Sandia National Laboratories is to have

153
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,430
high impact I know that when I go home

154
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,139
at the end of the day I have

155
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,280
accomplished something that's going to

156
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,280
be bigger than myself

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,669
okay well while Vince sets up his laptop

158
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,710
let me just say a few more words so my

159
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,500
job is a partnerships manager for

160
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,870
manager working with purdue university

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,150
so sandy has identified purdue is one of

162
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,770
a select select group of universities

163
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,840
that we want to develop deeper

164
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,659
partnerships with and as a consequence

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,789
of they've assigned me here to live in

166
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,099
west lafayette and develop research

167
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,750
relationships with Purdue faculty and

168
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,840
with students so if you want to learn

169
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,180
more about Sandhya's mission after the

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,770
the presentation feel free to reach out

171
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,759
to me I have an office in Discovery Park

172
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,008
and we and I regularly bring out a staff

173
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
from Sandia as well as managers to

174
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:43,289
interface with with new faculty and

175
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,520
students all right with that I'll pass

176
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,030
it off to well also introduce will stat

177
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,299
real quick

178
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:54,090
I was critical part of the team

179
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:00,360
he is keeps me honest keeps me on track

180
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:02,130
and he's a great asset talk a little

181
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,570
about your background sure my name is

182
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,310
Will stout I've been at Sandia for about

183
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,169
four-and-a-half years now everything in

184
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,020
there was true to a point to a point

185
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:13,229
true to a point before come Sandia as a

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,120
DoD guy so I ran DoD active duty type

187
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,400
things in the communication

188
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,050
cybersecurity domain at Sandia I

189
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,549
continued on but now I'm delving more

190
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,530
into the research and development aspect

191
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,389
so my background is primarily networking

192
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,309
Software Defined Networking delving into

193
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,199
some cloud space delving into some IOT

194
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,389
as well awesome

195
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,219
so hopefully this will be interesting

196
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,950
talk I like lots of feedback I tell lots

197
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,820
of jokes I'll pick on people but we're

198
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,620
going to talk a little about network

199
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,640
deception and some of the research we've

200
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,610
done in the last three three four four

201
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,078
years now on how we look at network

202
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,480
deception as an emerging field as

203
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:51,689
emerging technology to help understand

204
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:53,190
for intelligence jump in so we'll talk a

205
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,010
little bit about introduction motivation

206
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,089
the environment itself and then sort of

207
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,200
the differentiating factors of the

208
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,820
technology and then we'll walk through

209
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,270
some we'll walk through some awesome use

210
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,620
cases and then conclude right I think we

211
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,180
have time there's video there's video at

212
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,070
the end if we have time yep I also speak

213
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,859
very quickly so feel free to say

214
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,750
I don't make much sense I like I like

215
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,590
laughter it's okay it's okay to laugh

216
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,100
it's okay

217
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,360
I swear all right so so deception as a

218
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,350
whole right has existed for years and

219
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,450
years and years right there's been lots

220
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,700
of prior art in this field in philosophy

221
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,790
in the military you know in countless

222
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,350
areas and as a whole you know it's also

223
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,910
existed in computer network defense

224
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,420
right so things like honey pots have

225
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,160
existed

226
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,990
I think I'm not here to talk much about

227
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,630
theory or background or doctrine in this

228
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,510
area more application use cases so I'm

229
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,250
very operationally focused individual

230
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,390
and talk a little bit background so we

231
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,130
go through this but it's like how do you

232
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,110
build tools what are the tools that are

233
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,939
available to analysts and to network

234
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,660
defenders in order to aid them in doing

235
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,540
their job so so we contend you know

236
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,089
deception is a powerful concept that has

237
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,170
been underutilized by Network defenders

238
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,030
there's a lot of contemporary tools that

239
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,209
are not sophisticated enough to deal

240
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:05,069
with the threat actors that we see today

241
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,080
they're awesome in creating the fog of

242
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,790
war but at the end of the day this

243
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,170
hopefully you understand from this talk

244
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,410
the hope is to close the gap between

245
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,579
understanding the defenders goal which

246
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,780
is to defend the network and then

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,070
gathering threat intelligence and

248
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,600
merging those two right using deception

249
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,400
as a mechanism to say hey threat

250
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,630
intelligence is produced so understand

251
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,949
when it emissary compromises a network

252
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,540
or compromises a machine there's

253
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,490
information you can gather from them in

254
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,990
real time to aid and defend the network

255
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,190
and how do we close that gap in the

256
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,510
real-time fashion with that's not

257
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,280
intrusive and then so the defenders

258
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,260
needs right so I came from an

259
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,199
operational background I was very much

260
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,850
focused on net defense on our on our

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,880
systems and working with partner systems

262
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,560
and understanding hey so there are there

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,330
is a need right so if you look at modern

264
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,500
techniques and tools they're very

265
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,850
reactionary in the sense that a

266
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,560
compromise has existed somewhere else

267
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,750
and we're trying to mitigate it so we

268
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,969
have things like IPS SIDS is you know

269
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,080
network firewalls etc are there to

270
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,110
prevent an action that's already been

271
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,120
seen there very reactionary and it

272
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,340
doesn't really necessary necessarily

273
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,340
evolve a threat once threat happens when

274
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,050
start exists you know these signatures

275
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,910
are very static and not very mutable so

276
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,280
how did we get to the point of

277
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,870
understanding what the adversary is

278
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,819
doing and what we see is we lose lots of

279
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,050
threat intelligence from that space

280
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,730
right so when there's a compromise at a

281
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,540
site at a location what it was our

282
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,769
instinct as a network

283
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,120
defender what do you want to do unplug

284
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,740
the box right want to say hey stop the

285
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,910
bleeding the bleeding has happened our

286
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,279
job is to stop that bleeding

287
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,699
but the constants the consequence is we

288
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,139
don't really know how or what the

289
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,699
motivation of that emissary is how much

290
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,829
information did they know before coming

291
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,240
in what what are they looking for are

292
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,380
they have they been there before those

293
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,670
are the questions I'm interested in

294
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,550
right because that's gonna further help

295
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,969
develop the the my capabilities to

296
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,019
defend that network so really at the

297
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,970
time there's about three three and a

298
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,740
half years ago right we said hey the

299
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,170
network defender there there are a few

300
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,699
or limited capabilities that allowed us

301
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,839
to interact with with our adversaries or

302
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,170
adversaries

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
since we're they exist on network and we

304
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,370
want to enable a network defendant

305
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,899
interact with it in some level so we

306
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,250
said well we need a belt bid build

307
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,839
better tools to gather information about

308
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,269
our adversaries so what we try to do

309
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,850
even more so there's over the last few

310
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,800
years we've seen some interesting trends

311
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,509
also there's lots of intelligence needs

312
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,269
and that is you know you see a lot of

313
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:22,610
intelligence feeds so things like

314
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,019
eyesight partners and eye defenses

315
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,750
purchases in the last you know year year

316
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,100
and a half by fire I and others are

317
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,569
these threat feeds I have taken tens of

318
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,220
years to develop are now going behind

319
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,120
behind the curtain and other companies

320
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,139
are buying them and not freely

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,730
accessible they're not being

322
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,670
disseminated the information could

323
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,620
become not necessarily as ubiquitous as

324
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,449
it is right now so in three years you

325
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,250
know what else is gonna happen or other

326
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:46,229
feeds are all the feeds gonna get

327
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,120
purchased other things like that are

328
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,250
sort of emerging issues from a threat

329
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,430
perspective and on top of that we're

330
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,279
saying hey is there a way to sort of

331
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,469
create a custom profile custom set of

332
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,959
tools to proactively defend my

333
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,970
networking and ask questions about the

334
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:07,589
security posture of my organization in a

335
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:09,779
very tailored fashion so so about in

336
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,339
2015 there was a report released by

337
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,930
Gartner and this is to me is some set of

338
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,939
validation about techniques and

339
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,920
information that we've been producing

340
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:18,509
and they said you know deception and

341
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,420
this Gartner report deception is an

342
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:25,610
emerging field and they believe by 2025

343
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,649
that by 2025 they're gonna see that

344
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,480
deception as a technique is going to be

345
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,790
operationalized and used by about 20 to

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,260
25 percent of the community by in order

347
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,310
to help protect the network this is a

348
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,990
basis for

349
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:42,239
yes sir on your deception procedures are

350
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,980
you looking at the capability of being

351
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,930
able to pretend that nothing has

352
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,180
happened on a network and then shift all

353
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,760
your traffic to another one and conduct

354
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,050
business there that is one mechanism so

355
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
we'll be walking through like three or

356
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,319
four different operational modes and

357
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,000
that is one one way is that you have the

358
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,529
operational network here and then using

359
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,120
Sdn and a couple other strategies you

360
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,100
can move them to another network that

361
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,810
exists and coexist at the same time and

362
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,779
let them continue the OP within that

363
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,349
environment but yes yes sir

364
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,790
so again right there is significant

365
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,260
opportunities in advanced threat

366
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,270
detection and there's a need for

367
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,380
actionable intelligence and if you read

368
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,310
the report but there's lots of gaps

369
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,700
right now if you look at the commercial

370
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,380
field they're emerging as they're coming

371
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,640
there are emerging market leaders but

372
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,080
there's still a lot of deficiencies and

373
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,000
they even claim that you need to be able

374
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,680
to develop and synthesize actual

375
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,660
intelligence so there's lots of

376
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,339
different places so they map to again

377
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,390
the garden report they were mapped to

378
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,640
different parts of the cyber kill chain

379
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,960
and they say there's different ways that

380
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,339
you can live within that space and as we

381
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,440
go through the presentation we'll talk

382
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,390
about some of how we live and coexist

383
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,570
across most most of space in order to

384
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,730
sort of successfully mitigate threat so

385
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,380
some more motivation right so if you

386
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,940
think about it a common IT

387
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,320
infrastructure is built off of

388
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,339
predictability right we want common

389
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,500
configuration management common patch

390
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,120
management the infrastructure has in

391
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
order to have hygiene you have ubiquity

392
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,910
you have how much in eighty and that's

393
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,720
actually what's being used in leverage

394
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,829
by or adversary in order to maximize

395
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,540
their opportunity within our environment

396
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,740
so if they can compromise one box it's

397
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,310
likely think of or has compromised

398
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,470
multiple boxes on top of that our

399
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,880
contention is that we can exploit this

400
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,709
understanding and exploit this

401
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,970
expectation of homogeneity through cloud

402
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,560
and virtualization technologies and say

403
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,100
hey there may be things that change and

404
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,119
and you may not know about them so

405
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,440
through deception right there's lots of

406
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,450
things we can do and we'll talk about

407
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,560
how you know from a mindset perspective

408
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,060
we want to do a lot of things in order

409
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,829
to change the asymmetric nature of how

410
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,839
we see threat today very much so you

411
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,700
know they pop a box and there's the

412
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,260
right they can break any window within a

413
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,940
house and they can get in and steal our

414
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,470
information right that's that's one

415
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,970
approach right so the hope is that we

416
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,780
want we can do things like devalue the

417
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,270
information that they're gathering

418
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,140
increase the difficulty attack expose

419
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,180
their intent

420
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,589
limit the scope the attack introduced

421
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,989
doubt into their minds when an attack

422
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,000
happens and say hey so when when an

423
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,830
attack is going on if you use an exploit

424
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,360
if you try to exfil data and things

425
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,220
don't work what is the issue is the

426
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,320
issue of my my device is the issue with

427
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,850
my capability is the issue with the

428
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
network connection there's a lot the

429
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,649
hope is to changing introduce work

430
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,779
somewhere in their lifecycle in order to

431
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,329
help them help us change asymmetric

432
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,850
nature of the attack who sorry

433
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,939
I also drank a monster so I'm speaking

434
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,950
very quickly but so there's a three

435
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,769
three focus areas that we focus on and

436
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,600
part of it is you know again we take a

437
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:31,410
very systems approach to things right so

438
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,089
you try to introspect and understand

439
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,589
what's going on the endpoint understand

440
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,180
and change the mutability of the network

441
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,890
and then the environment itself so how

442
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,349
do you create an environment such that

443
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,060
you can have things like highly

444
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,680
virtualized highly complex environments

445
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,670
with traffic generation and then tailor

446
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,890
that the operational vironment the

447
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:55,829
existent so the environment itself so

448
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:59,760
for me the approach is that we have

449
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,529
virtualization and the print assessing

450
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,400
factor right so if you think about three

451
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,709
years ago what ends up happening is what

452
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,390
we saw is that you know cloud was

453
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,919
becoming more more ubiquitous on top of

454
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,470
that about three three and a half years

455
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,270
ago Sdn was becoming a little bit more

456
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,709
more prevalent and was emerging as a as

457
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,730
an interesting area right so you have

458
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,770
mutability in the network and the

459
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,660
amiability on the endpoint through

460
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,329
virtualization so we're saying hey can

461
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,919
we leverage that sort of change in the

462
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,020
operational environment so these things

463
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,940
are coming in and being adopted by you

464
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,100
know fortune 500 companies common

465
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,110
enterprises so the hope is that through

466
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,909
these changes the network we can then

467
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,850
help inject ourselves in the life cycle

468
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:43,770
somewhere so the other half is I have

469
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,000
this belief right if you go back and how

470
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,918
we're it so I have this belief and

471
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,330
that's you know they're adversaries are

472
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,790
very sophisticated they keep on pulling

473
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,870
on information and there's very much you

474
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,159
need to be able to extract information

475
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,199
about what's going on if you look at a

476
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,760
lot of tools that exist there this

477
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
understanding of what a TTP is what tool

478
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,419
taxes procedure is being able extract

479
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,460
and real-time is

480
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,720
not it doesn't exist right we do very

481
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,970
much forensics right so if you think

482
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,440
about the box when the box is proper is

483
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,179
how we extract information from that is

484
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,830
we pulled the pull the plug and we do

485
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,119
forensics the question for me was could

486
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,189
we do that in a more real-time fashion

487
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,779
could we start understanding hey as the

488
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,309
compromise is happening as adversaries

489
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,419
working on our networks could we

490
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:21,440
understand how they're navigating the

491
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,609
directory structure can we understand

492
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,210
when information they're looking for

493
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:28,369
will plot passwords and tools may exist

494
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,480
that they have and then how they pivot

495
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,459
through the network right to me that's

496
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,409
all actual information it's like hey

497
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,450
when you have a compromise why are you

498
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,340
here what are you looking for and what's

499
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,529
valuable to you all that should be fed

500
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,749
back to network defender so that's where

501
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,389
our transparent reaching capabilities

502
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:45,769
sort of work and the agent lists for me

503
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,928
right so if you look at all of other

504
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:49,580
approaches and technology space right

505
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,019
now they're very agent focused right so

506
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,668
to me they're you're putting something

507
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,470
in there either custom or commercial

508
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,879
that may exist the problem is that to me

509
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,919
is a signature that's a something that

510
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:59,149
you or an adversary can see so how can I

511
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,100
do this in a transparent fashion without

512
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:03,199
them knowing what I'm doing to them or

513
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,928
interact or how I'm interacting with

514
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,299
them on top of that we have this belief

515
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,649
that is you need to merge lots of pieces

516
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:11,779
of information so host based information

517
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,850
so package logs is where the world comes

518
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,289
front comes down to for me right so get

519
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,939
log information system call information

520
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,279
guess the information and merge that

521
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,769
dynamically with the network state so

522
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,480
getting things like dpi and merging that

523
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,200
dynamically so I can sort of see the

524
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,739
entire kill chain all at the same time

525
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,859
talk for a bit

526
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:35,359
sure yeah absolutely you guys having a

527
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:38,658
situational awareness goal yeah because

528
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,100
that's a pretty pretty pretty complex

529
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,559
task are you guys gonna get into that a

530
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,730
moment or yeah I think it is the

531
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,809
approach and where and how we have

532
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,480
everything and then we threw everything

533
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,129
into to jump to the the punch line is we

534
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,720
throw everything into a seam so we've

535
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:52,309
everything Splunk right now and then use

536
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,409
time Tim core assign time sequencing to

537
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,668
to get information out so you're still

538
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,619
at the raw data part yeah I'm really

539
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:59,659
quite figured out the human interface to

540
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:01,158
it because that's correct so the hope is

541
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:04,190
that you provide the information to the

542
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,809
analyst right so enabling where will

543
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,639
allude to some of this is sort of the

544
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,019
work that the collaboration hopefully is

545
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,039
in some areas like causality right we're

546
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,389
trying to get to the point where you

547
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,009
have all this information and you can

548
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,449
create causal graphs but that was the

549
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,830
starting point was how much information

550
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,910
can you pull dynamically in real

551
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,350
and then how do you store that

552
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,390
information and sort of worry where

553
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,850
where we're at today and now it's how do

554
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,220
you enable analysis primitives to help

555
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,750
the analyst navigate that data have you

556
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,930
looked into business intelligence cubes

557
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,060
so things like tableau and is that we're

558
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,470
talking about like you know when you're

559
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,270
capturing snapshot to the three

560
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,150
dimensional data in time and then doing

561
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,980
analysis so yeah we're looking at things

562
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,630
not necessarily business cubes but

563
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,400
looking at two poor crops and looking at

564
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,070
temp or graph evolution as one approach

565
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,990
but I've not looked at business cubes

566
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,600
yet okay may not be necessary it was

567
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,770
curious Thanks all right so as Vince

568
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,909
mentioned there are basically three

569
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,080
tenets I go into this deception

570
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,520
environment steps and framework

571
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,020
deception concept if you will and that's

572
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,879
the brutalization environment itself

573
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,950
that's a platform upon which we deploy

574
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,600
all of the the endpoints the network

575
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,190
system itself virtual machine

576
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
introspection so how can we reach into a

577
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,250
virtual machine to determine what's

578
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,659
going on and pull information out that's

579
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,310
reflective of what's happening on that

580
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,440
particular end point and of course

581
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,850
offered to find networking how can we

582
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,380
change the state of the network how can

583
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,209
we change the perspective of the network

584
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,950
either given from the the endpoint that

585
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,270
is the the user of the network or if

586
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,560
someone is going into the network to

587
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,930
attack how can we change all that

588
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,550
perspective in real time while still

589
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,290
maintaining things like TCP connections

590
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,430
so that these these breaks are these

591
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,810
changes in the network from an

592
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,760
operational network to Deception network

593
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,379
aren't necessarily noticed by those

594
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,350
people in the network or attack in the

595
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,000
network so the virtualization

596
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,840
environment itself so Sandia has a long

597
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,820
history of test test and evaluation

598
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,010
tests and test ranges and things like

599
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,030
that so we come from you want to talk a

600
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,900
little about that that's our background

601
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,940
right yeah so very much keep it this so

602
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,820
very much if you think about it

603
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,020
we come from ot backgrounds so how do

604
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,879
you do operational test in some

605
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,810
meaningful way how do you emulate system

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,570
States so you can understand

607
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,639
vulnerabilities things like that and

608
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,290
from that came a series of technologies

609
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,670
that we've evolved our last decade and

610
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,260
you know starting with live virtual

611
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,790
consistent modeling and external

612
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,930
high-density virtualization how do you

613
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:17,030
represent and create both services

614
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,070
networks and all the underpinning that

615
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,180
you could say oh let's let's build a so

616
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,740
for instance something tangible let's

617
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,600
say let's build Purdue right let's build

618
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,710
put news network ground up so give it a

619
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,990
sensor information let's say

620
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,020
hosts operating system information

621
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,700
service information account

622
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,830
mission how could you build all of that

623
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,450
in real time without having Alice in the

624
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,310
loop and we built a whole platform

625
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,050
around that we called sort of the

626
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,210
platform and the technology amulet

627
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,220
acquit of emulation and analytics

628
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,440
together so we can start reasoning and

629
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,810
the reason for this the outcome the

630
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,310
reason we built this is you know there's

631
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,750
really no science around cyber right now

632
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,020
and the lack of science around cyber

633
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,730
really understands causes a lot of non

634
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,500
determinism and lack of knowledge so

635
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,970
through experimentation much like a lot

636
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,400
of other basic sciences how they evolved

637
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,650
we believe that that's one way we can

638
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,120
start reasoning about the system so we

639
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,160
did a lot of stuff around this right so

640
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,719
we did a lot of Rijo sting and how do

641
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,190
you do hardware in the loop extremely

642
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,770
high density so we have a series of

643
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,720
technologies focusing on hey let me boot

644
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,900
700 Windows boxes on a single common

645
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,940
commodity blade so change the scheduler

646
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,160
and term memory to context switching

647
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,270
things right it's awesome awesome stuff

648
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,220
on top of that we want to extremely high

649
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,280
fastboot times so I don't want to wait

650
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,630
15 20 30 hours would be 10,000 virtual

651
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
machines I want to be able to put that

652
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,770
in five seven ten minutes so leveraging

653
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,139
all of that we also said hey can we also

654
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,770
automate the ability for us to represent

655
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,300
and discuss and code how a network is

656
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,160
specified so build the whole language

657
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,919
around that so saying hey this is what a

658
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,910
network how we represent services in

659
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,230
that network how we were present

660
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,490
operating systems how I represent sort

661
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,590
of links and nodes routing

662
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,050
infrastructure and then create and boot

663
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,310
all of that in an autonomous fashion so

664
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,419
that was the underpinning of this so we

665
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,800
started this about three years ago and

666
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,660
there was a there that was the

667
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,360
foundation right we had a great ability

668
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,650
to say hey we can build these cool

669
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,719
networks that are highly representative

670
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,330
that people like red teams and blue

671
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,130
teams interact with can we use the same

672
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,689
technology and say can we just even

673
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,070
adversary with it so that's where we

674
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,450
started any questions so far numb

675
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,030
speaking quickly you guys seem super

676
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:21,910
enthused I see lots of ingress lots of

677
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:24,899
eyes that's okay all right so thank you

678
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,100
for laughing I appreciate that

679
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,260
so the virtualization environment so

680
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,939
this is basically a view graph that that

681
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,230
displays everything that Vince just said

682
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,060
how we go about creating these high

683
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,820
fidelity virtual environments we don't

684
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,620
have to get into the depth of this in

685
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,639
the interest of time so let's move away

686
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,469
from the environment let's start to look

687
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,850
at virtual machine introspection kind of

688
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,130
went over that glossed over a little bit

689
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,870
machine introspection is let's get down

690
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,420
into the nitty-gritty here okay so with

691
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,189
a hypervisor can we go in through this

692
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,810
hypervisor and you know there are some

693
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,880
solutions here that I already exist for

694
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,050
virtual machine introspection we would

695
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,460
like to take a different approach and a

696
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,659
lot of the reasons are here I mean the

697
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,000
API is exist in some of these

698
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,910
hypervisors to do to some we're not

699
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,710
remedial but um basic basic some more

700
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,000
basic type of virtual machine

701
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,800
introspection but you can see right here

702
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,030
on the right side these rings right so

703
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,440
you have to pass through a couple

704
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,629
different rings the context switches

705
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,040
which involves some overhead in trying

706
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,780
to gather information out of these

707
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,340
virtual machines so we said well let's

708
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,990
take a different approaches just build a

709
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,550
rootkit essentially a hypervisor a

710
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,080
rootkit that goes directly into the

711
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,310
hypervisor so we don't have to worry

712
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,230
about that we can live in kernel space

713
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,610
pull the information out directly to

714
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,100
minimize the impact on that virtual

715
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:34,020
machine and the reason for that raise if

716
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:36,610
you think so tools exist right Livy my

717
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,200
is that access a variety of other tools

718
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,270
right but when we're talking about rings

719
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,210
right the challenge is computationally

720
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:46,270
right in order for me to get the VM get

721
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,620
vmi in and out of the virtual machines

722
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,940
it's computation expensive right so if

723
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,750
you think about how much data we want to

724
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,790
pull it magic if you want to pull

725
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,090
everything every system call every

726
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,060
binary every every executable that was

727
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,230
ever loaded into that box in real time

728
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,340
there's there's great tools out there

729
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,420
however they're not built for that

730
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,040
they're built for very targeted

731
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,140
questions they're saying hey I want to

732
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,000
build I want to gather you know this

733
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,210
specific system call or I want to access

734
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,160
I'll get all you know a file IO

735
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,390
primitives off of this system and we

736
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,060
said hey let's take a different approach

737
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,850
and say could if I could could I pull

738
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,649
everything from the virtual machine and

739
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,600
then store it somewhere so that's that's

740
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,130
what bull is alluding to yeah exactly so

741
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,649
the idea is like let's get all the

742
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,570
information and data first and then we

743
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,500
have it let's reason about it but we

744
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,669
have to have everything first because

745
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,870
you can't go back in time at that point

746
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,410
right you have to have everything right

747
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,989
there and then

748
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,490
so the initial idea you kind of went

749
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,310
over this I've kind of went over this is

750
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,410
that VMs run until a reversible stream

751
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,790
quire's of VM exit that is that's the

752
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,530
the act of the virtual machine

753
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,570
requesting access from the hypervisor

754
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,980
some type of resource that the

755
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,710
hypervisor provides from the operating

756
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,220
system annoying operating system so that

757
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,930
is what we hope yes sir thank you guys

758
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,370
done a Pareto analysis to figure out the

759
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,380
20

760
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,179
me together it might make 80% of the

761
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,550
difference because this is a wide open

762
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,840
world yeah so no we have not I think

763
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,250
we've worked in lots of different spaces

764
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,780
and using sort of commercial tools and

765
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,940
said let's fuse that so you think of

766
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,220
things lots of tools provide data right

767
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,040
so IPS is ideas and firewalls host based

768
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,500
information like host base agents we

769
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,940
said you know it goes back to my comment

770
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,260
about the science of cyber right so we

771
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,840
don't know and we don't know how to

772
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,300
reason about a lot of things and so we I

773
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,530
agree we need to get there and to sort

774
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,120
of do the analysis to say what is the

775
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,940
most valuable information to cost to

776
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,770
reduce the cost of both storage and i/o

777
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,270
to sources information but we've took

778
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,070
the approach which was let's gather

779
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,960
everything we can and figure out what's

780
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,178
important right because the challenge

781
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,860
for us is you know especially as a

782
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,540
network defender there may not be a

783
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,070
sensor necessarily that indicates that

784
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,840
this is a compromise right so how do I

785
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,370
investigate that and how do I create

786
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,830
causality and relationships off that

787
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,870
data in some meaningful way when I may

788
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,399
not know that exists so as we run

789
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,479
experiments right we learned a lot as we

790
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,040
worked with red teams right it's like

791
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,450
where teams are very creative episodes

792
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,040
very creative and when I say let me just

793
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,929
look at file i/o let me just look at

794
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,428
this specific thing it's interesting you

795
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,510
can evolve and find absolutely the

796
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,980
system system call there may be a

797
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,090
trigger that gets you to another point

798
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,770
that creates a causal relationship

799
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,570
between you know file access network

800
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,700
access and an exploit so that's that's

801
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,200
the reason why we we decided to say

802
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,600
let's let's take the kitchen sink and

803
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,820
see if it's possible first right and

804
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,350
we've been subtracting features over

805
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,850
time so we've noticed I'd like certain

806
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,290
things are just congesting and being

807
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,120
super noisy when we pull out all the

808
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,220
data and we take them out because may

809
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,820
not be adding any purpose but the option

810
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:36,000
the option still exists okay so I'm

811
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,530
gonna pick it up a little bit sure so at

812
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,300
a low level what what can we get out of

813
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,220
hugging the VM exit handle so we can

814
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,870
pull out things like system calls that

815
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,290
are directly relevant to the virtual

816
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,090
machine itself but we can also pull out

817
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,740
more targeted things like windows

818
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,590
functions and things like that as well

819
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,090
as injecting things back into the

820
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,919
virtual machine so it's a - it's a

821
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,919
two-way two-way Road in that respect

822
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,250
sure and that's that's one of the

823
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,580
research questions that we have as well

824
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:08,880
right I think yeah one of our papers we

825
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,189
look at that the the cloud paper we look

826
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,810
at that so yeah

827
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,400
we want to be able to protect that if

828
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,629
somebody you know there are all types of

829
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,980
different attacks so someone does like a

830
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,350
breakout attack and they want to get

831
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,360
into that you know that could be that

832
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,560
could definitely be a problem but that's

833
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,919
that's an open research question for

834
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:32,480
ourselves as well yeah how would you

835
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:34,970
protect the hook yeah okay so why do we

836
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,540
why do we go the path we wanted to so

837
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,510
our BMI is based completely on a KVM the

838
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,850
kernel virtual machine a hypervisor for

839
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,410
the Linux systems we didn't want to be

840
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,070
able to we wanted to just be able to

841
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,090
drop the hook into any type of system so

842
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,860
we wanted to minimize any other

843
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,510
dependencies that you that would

844
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,280
normally go to implementing a virtual

845
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,780
machine introspection tool so we didn't

846
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,610
want to have to patch KMI we had

847
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,320
previous projects that actually did this

848
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,629
where we're dependent on a particular

849
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,830
version of KVM well you know with the

850
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,990
updates and things like that and

851
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,669
software software that dies out very

852
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,010
very quickly so we wanted to be able to

853
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:13,580
to have a a kernel module that we could

854
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:16,160
insert and remove at whim and the only

855
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,870
dependencies was basically a compiler a

856
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,970
C compiler copilot on the end system

857
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,340
bang you had a kernel module drop it and

858
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,960
pull it out as maybe I also lent itself

859
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,449
to portability on different systems as

860
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,790
well we did not want to be able we did

861
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,320
not want to have to utilize any type of

862
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,820
dependency particularly with things like

863
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,010
symbol tables so you'll see a lot of

864
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,330
virtual machine introspection tools I

865
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,070
require the symbols for their particular

866
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,419
operating system well we didn't want to

867
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,950
have to do that we want to be able to do

868
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,960
things dynamically so you insert the

869
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,000
kernel module onto the endpoint or onto

870
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,100
the host bank and just walks memory and

871
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,470
then determines heuristic aliy what are

872
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,230
the symbols and correlate corresponding

873
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,480
to that virtual machines print imprints

874
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,280
in memory another thing as we saw is

875
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,100
patching as a lot of Windows patching

876
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,879
has evolved we've seen that as patches

877
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,530
change they remove they remove things

878
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,150
like symbols for specific functions as

879
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,910
you see that you lose context right so

880
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:10,820
you may rely on a specific piece of

881
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:12,050
specific or specific symbol we didn't

882
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,490
really necessarily want to be bound to

883
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,169
that right so we want to be able to say

884
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,180
hey if I'm collecting this information

885
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,260
now and exist in the future we want to

886
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,360
continue be able to collect that without

887
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,120
having to depend on third-party symbol

888
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,429
libraries

889
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,679
and of course everything is done at

890
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,270
runtime so we inject it determines what

891
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,160
kind of operating system it is and then

892
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,440
fills out the symbol table which we then

893
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,980
use to pull out certain windows

894
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,600
functions and the parameters high-level

895
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,980
abilities so at very high level what can

896
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,959
we do with that we can get the process

897
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,270
information that is corresponding to the

898
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,450
user command line entries the PD images

899
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,639
that are in store executed on the the

900
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,380
endpoint itself we can look at the DLLs

901
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,970
or executables that are loaded on that

902
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,320
particular virtual machine additionally

903
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,990
we can actually pull those out of memory

904
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,550
as they're loaded so if something never

905
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,500
gets written to disk we can still pull

906
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,240
it out of memory as it's executed we

907
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,950
have specific API hooks and these are

908
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,960
the things that we can tailor so if we

909
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,940
notice that we try to pull a particular

910
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,500
API hook that is providing excessive

911
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,000
amounts of noise well we can take that

912
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,710
out on the fly and not have to worry

913
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,900
about that any longer or we can pull it

914
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,190
put it inject it back onto the the

915
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,960
kernel module itself so we can gather

916
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,520
that type of information we can run

917
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,340
arbitrary functions within the virtual

918
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,440
machine primarily to do things like

919
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,000
redirection and if we have time we can

920
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,910
we can look at a couple demos there and

921
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,110
of course we can input so we can put

922
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,910
commands into the virtual machine to

923
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,500
change some things about the state again

924
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,730
this is all agentless right so this is

925
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,200
coming from the hypervisor so these

926
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,640
aren't necessarily originating within

927
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,720
the virtual machine itself so if

928
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,250
somebody's on the virtual machine I'll

929
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,870
send their system temp it's time time

930
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,890
starts changing they're not going to

931
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,479
notice that that it's coming from a

932
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,660
particular agent it's actually

933
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,930
transparent to them all right so for the

934
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:52,600
Sdn aspect as Vincent mentioned the the

935
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,490
this was started with at the the genesis

936
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,679
of Sdn really coming into the research

937
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,880
space and so we said well let's take

938
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,030
advantage of this so we can do away with

939
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,200
all the the little constraining

940
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,360
protocols that normally go with

941
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,340
communication systems let's build it up

942
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,719
from the ground up closely integrates

943
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,000
with cloud type or virtual type

944
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,680
environments and let's Mel it's make

945
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,420
let's create a malleable fabric Network

946
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,100
fabric that we can control or we can

947
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:19,420
extract information from an SD and

948
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,449
controlled fabric that we could then

949
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,810
pull information out that we could also

950
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,940
change the the particular attributes of

951
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,970
a network so if we're looking at VLANs

952
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,170
we're looking at IP addresses MAC

953
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,970
address so we can change those types of

954
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,710
things additionally we can also redirect

955
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,840
the connectivity from a bertram

956
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,950
- any other endpoint within that virtual

957
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,500
environment so that we can do things

958
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,790
like man-in-the-middle on-the-fly with

959
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,760
some other the different technologies

960
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,270
that we have at Sandia additionally

961
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,260
since we owned the fabric we also have

962
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,810
layer seven dpi

963
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,940
tool sets that we've written to not only

964
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,440
extract class or to classify certain

965
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,360
types of data but also to pull out

966
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,050
metadata that we we believe it's

967
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,949
important to do it basically what

968
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,980
determine what's happening on host

969
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,120
correlated back to network or vice versa

970
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,530
that's one of the interesting things are

971
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,639
I just you think about it as you start

972
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,440
pulling the thread and trying to

973
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,699
understand what's happening why is it

974
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,560
happening where is it happening right

975
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,969
some from a forensics perspective we

976
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,370
want to try to piece all those things

977
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,839
together and be able right so if you

978
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,219
take a peak a period after that we

979
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,960
didn't want to offline analysis right so

980
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,069
could we do online analysis of

981
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,710
everything then that's why we're trying

982
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:28,300
to do a real-time dpi right is to enable

983
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,250
us to say let's extract this metadata

984
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,770
and be able to fuse that without having

985
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,380
to do it afterwards exactly so the high

986
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,880
level methodology here with with regard

987
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,070
to an operational Network and

988
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,140
interception network is that you would

989
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,700
have somebody attacking an operational

990
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,759
asset within the environment itself

991
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:48,520
that's a you can see little attacker guy

992
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,020
up there attacking some virtual machine

993
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,480
within our network that virtual machine

994
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,670
over time is communicate with s1 s2 and

995
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,650
s3 and we're not talking about the

996
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,790
detection mechanisms here right because

997
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,190
that's not really the business that

998
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,050
we're into so nor Chile naturally

999
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,220
something else with an alarm a an

1000
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,860
analyst that something is happening

1001
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,509
within the network given some period of

1002
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,040
time that's are an arbitrary period of

1003
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,480
time that can be specified we say ok

1004
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,090
this particular virtual machine is

1005
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,190
communicated with s1 s2 and s3 over this

1006
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:18,700
period of time that we are interested in

1007
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:21,820
so at that point we can initiate a what

1008
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,069
we call a live migration so this virtual

1009
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,570
machine is migrated from the operational

1010
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,150
Network into the deception Network and

1011
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,560
those 3 s 3 s 1 s 2 and s 3 are

1012
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,790
essentially cloned these are cloned

1013
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,040
virtual machines that go into the

1014
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,020
deception network so that as this

1015
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,610
adversary begins to look at things in

1016
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,620
the network in this deception network

1017
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,210
there's familiarity he realized he

1018
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,009
recognizes these particular virtual

1019
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,740
machines are still there so that he's

1020
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,630
not tipped off I'm using Sdn we install

1021
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,709
static flows from that adversary into

1022
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,270
the deception network so that they

1023
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,630
cannot get back into the operational

1024
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,880
network

1025
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,010
and that also allows the cloning uh the

1026
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,050
cloning process allows us to go back

1027
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,210
into this operational network do types

1028
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,740
of remediation things like that so you

1029
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,390
can patch or mediate right without

1030
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,220
having to impact the rest of operations

1031
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,690
and the hope is right if there's active

1032
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,250
connections right if you I wanted to

1033
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,600
plug up pull on this just a little bit

1034
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,980
if you think about it right there's

1035
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,540
active connections going on right so if

1036
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,740
you don't think about what we tradition

1037
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,210
do is you pull the plug right so if an

1038
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,850
adversary is coming in and saying hey

1039
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,560
I'm on this box I am I have an active

1040
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,569
TCP connection with the Sdn controller

1041
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,880
we're able to say okay let's take this

1042
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,350
this machine clone it and actually take

1043
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,120
their network state all their active

1044
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,799
network state all the active connections

1045
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,150
to see to that they may have the

1046
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,690
interactions they have with that system

1047
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:35,680
and then move them to a new environment

1048
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:37,600
usually people say no okay course there

1049
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,069
are a lot of gotchas there and we're not

1050
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,290
able to go through everything here but

1051
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,050
so some of the operating modes that we

1052
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,000
alluded to earlier and this is in order

1053
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,470
of increasing costs and increasing

1054
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,450
fidelity right so you're gonna have a

1055
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,370
trade-off between the the greatest

1056
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,899
fidelity high fidelity deception

1057
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,730
environment and the cost that comes with

1058
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,800
that so the first ones of course is a vm

1059
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,120
replacement so can we take this flow yes

1060
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,820
we can take this flow and then migrate

1061
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,290
it to a what we call warm vm that's if

1062
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,970
um that matches some of the similar

1063
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,890
attributes of that previous vm that it

1064
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,629
was migrated from not the highest

1065
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,890
fidelity but it serves some purpose for

1066
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,350
people with low cost who can't tolerate

1067
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,270
things like cloning in like that so it

1068
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,950
works well with physical machines so if

1069
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,380
you have a physical machine migrate the

1070
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,180
flow over to something else vm isolation

1071
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,250
and Quarantine this is actually masking

1072
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,049
off certain parts of this operational

1073
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,310
network and interesting there are a

1074
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,800
couple vendors that do this type of

1075
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:29,110
thing of course this will in turn cut

1076
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,420
off that connection to an external

1077
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,800
entity which does what it dis allows us

1078
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,570
from getting anymore intelligence about

1079
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,490
what they're doing this is essentially

1080
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:40,120
equivalent to the cut off net quite off

1081
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,890
proach of pulling the plug the next next

1082
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,810
level up is service a forking and

1083
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,819
service migration so this is the idea of

1084
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,020
cloning virtual machines right cloning

1085
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,360
virtual machines into a network or

1086
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,100
subset of the network is cloned to

1087
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,420
provide this high fidelity Deception

1088
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,950
environment and the last of course is

1089
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,480
running parallel deception networks high

1090
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,640
high high cost so this is lockstep

1091
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,980
having virtual machines are completely

1092
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,900
in lockstep with an operational network

1093
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,119
high cost but again this does provide

1094
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,440
the greatest amount of fidelity

1095
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,329
for a deception Network all right so

1096
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,900
guests and network data fusion so we

1097
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:16,259
take from the the cave EMI which was the

1098
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,119
hypervisor the hypervisor via my virtual

1099
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:21,329
machine introspection tool we take that

1100
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,549
all the data that comes out of that in

1101
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:25,079
conjunction with the network data which

1102
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:26,670
is all the flow rules that are

1103
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,799
established at any given time within the

1104
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,680
network as well as the DPI information

1105
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:33,739
and the dpi metadata and we merge that

1106
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,609
with all of the virtual machine

1107
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:38,489
information that we've pulled so we have

1108
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,200
virtual machine beep it's the the

1109
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:44,719
modules and drivers loaded system calls

1110
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,218
machine processes machine files sockets

1111
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,749
system FS type files would get over that

1112
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,089
we'll get into that in a little bit and

1113
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:53,218
we have fields I essentially correlate

1114
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:54,869
between all of these different source

1115
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,969
types so that we can start to stitch

1116
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:03,539
together what's happening in real time

1117
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:08,460
or after the fact in a network use case

1118
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:11,130
analyses alright so again going back to

1119
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,349
the original theme you can already see

1120
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,329
the malleability of the platform itself

1121
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:18,719
you can basically use this for any type

1122
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:21,539
of an analysis deception Network cyber

1123
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,769
security platform but for the theme here

1124
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:24,180
is we're talking about threat

1125
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:25,649
intelligence right so how can we get

1126
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,558
some information out of this network

1127
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,089
that is tangible that we can then feed

1128
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,890
back to the network defender that says

1129
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:33,599
ok here's what we've gotten we have

1130
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,430
certain signature certain attributes of

1131
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,109
this particular actor we can take that

1132
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,729
data and say ok now we have a signature

1133
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:40,109
that we can we can bring back to the

1134
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:43,799
network defender that they can use for

1135
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:45,538
further protection of the network and so

1136
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,690
these these are just a few of the

1137
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,249
different use cases that we have here

1138
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,920
the first one is VM as a platform for

1139
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:54,419
bad actors so for this particular use

1140
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,160
case you might have someone who jumps on

1141
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,960
their hosts and tries to steal certain

1142
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,578
information from that particular host or

1143
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,200
uploads and downloads files onto that

1144
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,700
host what can we get out of that

1145
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,558
signature such as hashes it's our

1146
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,729
particular file types are dropped onto

1147
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,410
it he's gonna walk through all of these

1148
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:08,669
in a minute and just do a deep dive and

1149
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,808
just walk through things like the UI and

1150
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,999
the data we're collecting do you want to

1151
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:13,349
just jump - yeah let's yeah this job

1152
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:14,288
took maybe one or two of these so we

1153
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,779
could have time to go through

1154
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,190
lots of words lots of words you just

1155
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:24,200
want to go to use key to start there

1156
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:26,380
okay so VMs an exploited end point okay

1157
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,569
so this is a little long one so

1158
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,519
essentially a virtual machine user or a

1159
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:34,220
user on a particular clean end point

1160
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,720
visits a malicious website this is the

1161
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,669
drive-by download if everyone's familiar

1162
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,269
with the drive-by download okay this is

1163
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,339
the drive-by download the attacker gains

1164
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:45,049
access and controls the particular

1165
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:46,759
endpoint that is downloaded the the

1166
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:48,740
malware and then starts to pivot through

1167
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:51,170
the network and so what have we done

1168
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,848
here so KVM i introspects all the

1169
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,009
information from the VMS we have network

1170
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,690
forensic logs that correlate that guest

1171
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:58,009
data to the network data and so we can

1172
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,140
essentially step through these logs to

1173
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:02,450
show what has happened not all the loud

1174
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,279
dad is here but enough is here to show

1175
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,140
what we're looking at so the first one

1176
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:08,599
is an administrator logs into a

1177
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,029
vulnerable workstation and visits a

1178
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,730
phishing website and so this is all this

1179
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:15,680
is all canned but the the website is a

1180
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,900
attacker comm and so we can see that

1181
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,819
within the DPI log we've extracted the

1182
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,890
metadata particular to a dns request

1183
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:23,239
this attacker comm and we've also got

1184
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,558
the IP address that goes along with it

1185
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,380
the next thing is the attacker

1186
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,880
compromises that endpoint through a

1187
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,529
vulnerability a several I terrible nura

1188
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,509
bility within the web browser itself and

1189
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:36,049
we can see that vulnerability come

1190
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:37,849
through another dpi log and then it

1191
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:40,788
opens a matter of Terp report on our

1192
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:43,730
meta trip report on part 2 2 to 2 and we

1193
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:45,859
also see that maybe not here but we'll

1194
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,210
see it a little bit later the attacker

1195
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:51,670
then starts a new process then

1196
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:53,960
notepad.exe and migrates to that process

1197
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,730
so that it's the user should close the

1198
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,079
the browser they'll still be resident on

1199
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,569
the endpoint machine and so we see that

1200
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,880
here with the opening of notepad.exe and

1201
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:04,220
then the attacker uploads a binary and

1202
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,680
executes sit on the endpoint and you can

1203
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,660
see this here notepad.exe is actually

1204
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,669
executing or creating a file it's

1205
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,069
executing a file called binary XE which

1206
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,589
is kind of strange why would notepad be

1207
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:17,420
executing a binary here and so at this

1208
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:20,029
point the attacker then downloads a file

1209
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,759
located on the the endpoints machine and

1210
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:24,859
so from the the logs we can see that

1211
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:26,539
he's starting to he opens up

1212
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,630
explorer.exe and starts to walk the

1213
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:32,190
directory so you can see

1214
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,420
here looking at the desktop all right

1215
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,310
and then he runs hashed up and loads

1216
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,560
mini cats to collect some passwords and

1217
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,090
at this point it uses those passwords to

1218
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,950
pivot to another machine within the

1219
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,920
network and you can see some of the

1220
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,359
eyepieces have changed here and then

1221
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,410
actually opens up a communication

1222
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,430
channel back to the back to his endpoint

1223
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,420
over port 3 3 3 3 and we see that here

1224
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,859
ok and then as information is

1225
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,690
transferred back we can see some high

1226
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,050
entropy URLs that are going back to that

1227
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:04,650
attacker machine very indicative of some

1228
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,900
attacks that we've seen ok and so in

1229
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,550
this is one part of the the former UI we

1230
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,010
were actually developing as Vincent

1231
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,710
Vince mentioned using some poor graph

1232
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,300
representations of the data previous UI

1233
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,190
though we can see the flows is there

1234
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,350
established on the endpoints and as they

1235
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,760
connect back from endpoint 1 to the

1236
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,560
active directory machine and then all

1237
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,120
the way back to this Green Dot which

1238
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:30,440
we've had to blur out the the IP address

1239
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:33,180
- okay so we got like five minutes left

1240
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,400
the other okay so this is a using cloud

1241
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,740
as a relay so this is another use case

1242
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,870
where if we had some own some portion of

1243
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:44,370
some cloud network could we be able to

1244
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:45,690
see tie-back maybe the use cases here's

1245
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,460
botnets right so if you have a virtual

1246
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,920
machine that's being leveraged as a

1247
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,810
botnet could we tie back the activity on

1248
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,400
that particular virtual machine to an

1249
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:57,810
application and so this is a quick one

1250
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:00,090
and so from our the data we extract from

1251
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:03,390
the virtual machine itself we can tie

1252
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:07,680
back to the connected connections from

1253
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:09,720
the the windows API to particular

1254
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,870
endpoints I P addresses and we can tie

1255
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,149
them back to the applications and cell

1256
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,770
so this is tied back to explorer.exe so

1257
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,210
from here we can start jumping off and

1258
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,560
correlating that dad to other things

1259
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,450
that are going on the virtual machine

1260
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,910
using the pit of the virtual machine as

1261
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,310
well as any further communications with

1262
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,649
IP addresses using the DPI log or the

1263
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:30,720
flow logs the hope from there is that we

1264
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,040
start correlating you know so we the

1265
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,540
system call information exists right so

1266
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,040
when you create a socket Sokka has to

1267
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,720
have an ephemeral port you walk through

1268
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,970
all of that and you can start really

1269
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,040
correlating process to sock it to

1270
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,609
network flow to associate a process

1271
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,779
information

1272
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:44,400
so you can have a full take of

1273
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:45,930
information so you can really start

1274
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,509
looking at what is the causal

1275
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,160
relationship between a process a

1276
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:51,869
specific system call a specific registry

1277
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,279
key change and what is making that

1278
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,059
change and what information is

1279
00:44:55,279 --> 00:45:02,989
transferring over the wire at the same

1280
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:05,609
time there you go okay

1281
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:07,529
so we have a couple more use cases again

1282
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:08,819
since we're limited on time we would

1283
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:10,799
just attend it to focus on how we

1284
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,589
extract some threat intelligence type

1285
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:17,009
data so so right

1286
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:19,078
hopefully rate the hope right from a

1287
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:20,819
mindset perspective I think we've really

1288
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,499
got to think rethink about how we're

1289
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,509
gathering information about people and

1290
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:25,769
how we're interacting with our system

1291
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:27,269
right at the end of the day right being

1292
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:28,680
able to understand the motivation and

1293
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:31,738
the techniques that they're using to get

1294
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,319
on our boxes is sort of the for me the

1295
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:36,599
the basis for us starting to develop

1296
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,890
better defenses and at least for us this

1297
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,900
was a starting point to start being able

1298
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,269
to say okay let me try to run an

1299
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,210
experiment with a potential adversary in

1300
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:46,979
some low risk environment and the low

1301
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,319
risk fashion such that I can interact

1302
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,489
with them and and start changing both

1303
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,230
the state and gathering information

1304
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:54,239
about them and then providing them

1305
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,730
breadcrumbs be it virtual machines be

1306
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,019
services be it data and then have them

1307
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,849
sort of navigate throughout my network

1308
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:01,078
and it's learn something about them

1309
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,309
right like there's a lot of interesting

1310
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,210
information you can start pulling like

1311
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:07,680
how they start commands how they what

1312
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,569
where in the file system they start

1313
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,339
looking those are I think are all

1314
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:13,589
transient information that's often lost

1315
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,788
by a lot of other systems and that's

1316
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:16,710
what you need to start looking at is

1317
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:19,680
saying okay so really when you start

1318
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,930
attributing hey someone's doing

1319
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,669
something to me the question is what are

1320
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,660
they doing how are they doing it when

1321
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,400
did they get there and then how they

1322
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,359
navigating sort of your network I think

1323
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,170
these are the things that we want to do

1324
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,549
so other part of it right is being able

1325
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,180
to change the network state and we

1326
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:34,380
didn't really get through the

1327
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,058
demonstration but it's also changing

1328
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,440
things on the network and things on the

1329
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,589
import and such that you can introduce

1330
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,329
doubt be it doubt in what the data

1331
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,369
they're pulling the doubt on the

1332
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:47,339
environment itself without an execution

1333
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:49,049
of of a binary just so that they have to

1334
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,130
do more work in order to understand

1335
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:53,130
what's going on in the network and

1336
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,390
that's it's part of what we're trying to

1337
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,170
do and then finally it's a it's really

1338
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,150
the correlate

1339
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,220
right so all this information should be

1340
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,020
able to autonomously be pulled and you

1341
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,189
can navigate and understand this

1342
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,500
information such that you can create

1343
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,540
action intelligence and to inform your

1344
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,559
operational defense infrastructure so

1345
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,680
you can develop things like your our

1346
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,660
signatures or sort signatures in such a

1347
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,020
way that you can inform future decision

1348
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:20,990
and defense techniques questions

1349
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:23,280
excitement Wyatt I understand yes sir so

1350
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:27,410
it sounds like at this point you're not

1351
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:31,549
really at a spot where you can say you

1352
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:34,410
could execute an interception with claws

1353
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:36,809
the attacker to gather information that

1354
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,359
will totally not just technically but

1355
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:40,799
from an operational perspective confuse

1356
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,970
you know confuse them in terms of what

1357
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,619
reality is that's a whole different

1358
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,089
that's a little different whole

1359
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,770
different research area right I think a

1360
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:49,290
lot of it is just frost it was using

1361
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,759
creating a platform right so right we're

1362
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,170
engineers we like to build stuff and

1363
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,520
that's really where we started was

1364
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,380
building a platform such that we can

1365
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,910
start asking a reasoning and interacting

1366
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:02,760
with someone and in some pseudo fit safe

1367
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:05,009
fashion obviously a very experienced

1368
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,809
people on a network where there's open

1369
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,809
collaboration that works verbally say

1370
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,540
I'm going I think the bad guys heard

1371
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:17,760
that and they would never do that on a

1372
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,589
radio network exactly if to another

1373
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,790
radio network continued traffic on the

1374
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:23,430
first one is if nothing ever happened

1375
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:27,299
and then conduct business securely

1376
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:32,190
elsewhere so it's good to see it's been

1377
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:37,500
fun any questions guys are quiet quite

1378
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:41,329
bunch huh what's your name sir make sure

1379
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,329
all right cool

1380
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,479
[Applause]

1381
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,120
you
