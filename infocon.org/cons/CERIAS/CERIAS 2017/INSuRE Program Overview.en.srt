1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,519
good afternoon and welcome back to the

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,740
Syria symposium I hope everybody enjoyed

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,370
lunch

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:19,400
our first speaker this afternoon is Mark

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:24,560
Lepke mark is a proud Boilermaker

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:27,320
graduate and a employee of the NSA he is

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,500
one of two seals which I can never

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,930
remember what the acronym er means but

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,840
when we produce the only University that

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,810
has two NSA seals assigned to them so

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,340
we're proud of that and Mark has been

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,520
very instrumental and very much involved

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,920
in serious the last several years and

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,739
one of the the things that he's been

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,530
instrumental in is springing and helping

16
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,589
develop the inshore program here at

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,840
Syria so the program started as a very

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,760
small project and we thought at the end

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,710
if the students came with a good project

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,660
we might send one of them actually to

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,180
the DC area to talk about their research

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,070
and it was such an overwhelming success

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,710
from the very beginning that we end up

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,508
sending all of the student teams out to

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,669
brief the NSA on their research that

26
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,170
they had done and the program that was

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,869
the beginning and the program has grown

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,749
since then so we invited mark back to

29
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,280
talk about the program its successes

30
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:25,429
things that he's learned from our

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,899
students and and opportunities probably

32
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:28,670
for others to be involved in the program

33
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:31,479
as well mark welcome back to campus

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:36,009
thank you very much Gary appreciate

35
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:38,779
thanks Joel Gary's down here Joel's here

36
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:42,200
it's a great honor to be here and to

37
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:43,700
share the aspects of insure with you and

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,219
a little bit about how it got started

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,939
but the briefing you heard right before

40
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:50,139
lunch

41
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,908
is a direct result of the insure project

42
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:55,548
that is one of our biggest successes

43
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,079
another one came from the National

44
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,599
Security Agency has a program called

45
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,658
commercial solutions for classified and

46
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,419
as you would suspect developing high in

47
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,060
cryptographic excepts systems is very

48
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:11,090
long tedious process you heard about the

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,519
formal methods that takes a long time so

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,880
we can't keep up with industry and so we

51
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:19,940
depend on cisco juniper Intel Microsoft

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,370
IBM all the big ones to create working

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,950
with us on how to develop secure systems

54
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,880
and so this whole program on commercial

55
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,649
solutions for classified looks at at

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,410
taking various systems and putting them

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,240
in line to create good boundaries for

58
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,230
network so if you put a Juniper or Cisco

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,810
and and some other router those aren't

60
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,840
going to fail all at the same time is

61
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,400
the theory ensure had a project where

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,500
one of the students actually developed

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,110
an application that helped prove that

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,180
and it was so successful we brought them

65
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,580
in as an intern cleared them gave them

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,070
the classified data have him redo it he

67
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,930
then productize it within NSA and that

68
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,790
is now share at the classified level

69
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,130
with many of our partners and he yes

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,049
will start working for NSA so that is

71
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,620
one of the aspects of ensure that we

72
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,300
also use is it's a great recruiting tool

73
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,950
I'd also like to acknowledge Melissa

74
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,670
dark who's in the audience if you could

75
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,339
stamp Melissa Melissa and I had a coffee

76
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,019
and at the Union in Starbucks back in

77
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,240
2012 and I'll talk a little bit about

78
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:29,240
that in a minute but if it wasn't for

79
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,860
Melissa yes if it wasn't for Melissa

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,870
insure would never have happened

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,940
john springer who's in the front row is

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,680
our current person working it and one of

83
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,770
our first graduates from it is hans

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,290
vargas who's up here in front so a lot

85
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,480
of a lot of opportunities to talk here

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,400
as a former air force officer like the

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,030
general I have been ingrained to give

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,910
you points here are my points and we'll

89
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,820
talk about those as we go along one of

90
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,170
the aspects of leveraging academia and

91
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,079
why it's so important from a

92
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,559
governmental standpoint we don't have

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,150
the cycles to study the science anymore

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,709
you can just imagine the cyber security

95
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,440
threats that are out there that the

96
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:13,370
National Security Agency is adjudicating

97
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,940
along with our our partners the inserts

98
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:20,149
the FBI Department of State Treasury all

99
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,760
of us are actively working on the threat

100
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,549
that is currently available to us there

101
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,250
is just not enough manpower to think

102
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,110
back about the science so what happened

103
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,110
that one that one afternoon

104
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,270
in the union is something I hope to also

105
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,740
give you guys as a stopping point

106
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,890
especially the students and Industry

107
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,320
that are here as well as academia never

108
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,640
be afraid to continue to ask but what if

109
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,110
so Melissa and I were sitting and we're

110
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,830
going well what if NSA would come in and

111
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,720
work with the students on these problems

112
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,599
because a lot of masters and PhD

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,600
students have to do a project right well

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,190
why pick something out of a textbook or

115
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,790
something that they just thought of why

116
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,610
not work on problems that are relevant

117
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:16,320
to national security that we can't get

118
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,850
to that was the genesis of ensure is we

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,550
started out we're able to sell it within

120
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,220
the agency because we have interns that

121
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,530
come into the agency all the time and we

122
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,560
give them projects to do so this was

123
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,799
just a virtual internship in essence and

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,900
so NSA has published on NSA gov you can

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,720
go to it today and it's the top ten

126
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,719
challenges that NSA faces that we can't

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,700
get to that was the initial set of

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,220
challenges that we gave to the students

129
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,490
to pick from and the important part is

130
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,310
we linked it to an actual technical

131
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,260
director at NSA to where that technical

132
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,360
director at NSA who's working the

133
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,210
current problems day-to-day became a

134
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,070
mentor to the student while Melissa and

135
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,169
her faculty topped the class on how to

136
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,900
do research because the class is about

137
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,090
how to do research which is a difficult

138
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,710
thing on how to do research how do you

139
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,599
curate data when you're done how do you

140
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,580
properly store it all those aspects of

141
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,310
doing research that's what the class is

142
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,979
built for but using problem sets that

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,990
are real and as you saw the two examples

144
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,700
that you just heard about those examples

145
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,630
actually come behind the green door at

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,650
NSA and we use those we use that work

147
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,469
students unfortunately don't get to see

148
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,349
the attributes of that but it does

149
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,050
improve national security the student

150
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,600
and faculties the the learning the

151
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,910
long-term research I think passwords we

152
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,700
did over how many semesters like four or

153
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,150
five different semesters we had projects

154
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,250
on the strength of passwords

155
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,669
so it taught the students how to pass on

156
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,190
research to the next class and then NSA

157
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:56,060
would offer different twists on how we

158
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,400
wanted that to be to be looked at the

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,139
history I have a bunch of little slides

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,539
I won't actually talk to them but you

161
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,979
can read them as I'm speaking 2012 was

162
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,900
the very first one as you can see we

163
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:09,830
started out with just five students hans

164
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,599
was one of those and just one where we

165
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,400
had three NSA technical directors

166
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,740
involved and as you can see as we

167
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,919
progress down through continually

168
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,750
increasing not only the universities

169
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,340
they have to be centers of academic

170
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,740
excellence for research of which Purdue

171
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,049
is one of the first cadre in that they

172
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,660
have to be those centers but then also

173
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,490
additional labs and I have a chart on

174
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,199
that to list all the the laboratories

175
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,050
and the other government agencies that

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,590
also place their problems into the

177
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,389
bucket for the students to choose I'll

178
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,780
just let you peruse through that and

179
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,150
then the current semester we've got 54

180
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,340
students and you can see the labs their

181
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,770
acronyms will be spelled out in a second

182
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,929
but I believe John correct me if I'm

183
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,950
wrong but I think we've sent through

184
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:00,229
about 354 students through this project

185
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,930
and they're at various locations with

186
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,880
various summer at NSA and I really

187
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,160
appreciate that others are in other

188
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,969
industry positions or with other

189
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,370
government agencies the return on

190
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,010
investment that we're getting from the

191
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,560
technical directors inside NSA is it

192
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,949
takes about as much time to work with an

193
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,470
intern so it's not a big load on their

194
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,620
normal day-to-day business but these

195
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,419
guys are then also excited because

196
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,520
they're working with students and the

197
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,659
students are asking questions that we

198
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,240
forgot to ask

199
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,039
how many of us get in our day-to-day

200
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,990
realm where we forget to ask some of the

201
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,240
tough questions yeah I see some hands

202
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,370
and some nods so the students are

203
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,380
stimulating us and it's really

204
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,360
interesting as many of these

205
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,720
organizations have we have these great

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,100
rooms at NSA has nothing but whiteboards

207
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,560
and it's cool to get inside one of those

208
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,470
rooms and we've taken on one particular

209
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
project the students we're working on

210
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,990
five

211
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,630
which was a protocol and we needed some

212
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,390
work on that and so we took what the

213
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,540
students did and we had to brief

214
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,189
Congress on that particular aspect and

215
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,930
we took that research into one of our

216
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,490
little white rooms and the guys were

217
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,109
just going crazy all over the White Bird

218
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,820
boards coming up with the briefing we

219
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,130
were going to give Congress and we did

220
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,080
give credit to the students so we were

221
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,630
down on the hill briefing this and said

222
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,890
you know by the way this came from these

223
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:32,839
teams act through the ensure project so

224
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,270
a lot of aspects that the TDS are

225
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,920
getting out of it the students we're

226
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,560
hearing back from them then it's

227
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,810
interesting to actually work with a live

228
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,180
NSA technical director somebody at

229
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,359
Pacific Northwest labs somebody at Oak

230
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:51,199
Ridge Tennessee John Hopkins Applied

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,210
Physics lab actually working with people

232
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,420
who are doing the hard problems today

233
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:59,000
they're in this interaction through

234
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,920
email into virtual technologies all the

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,080
technical directors their skin to the

236
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,209
game if they're bringing a problem to

237
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,279
the table for the students is their skin

238
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,050
in the game is every Friday they have

239
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,110
visit they have office hours virtually

240
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,670
and the class meets every Friday and

241
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,790
you'll see the amount of universities

242
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,729
and that's nationwide on Friday

243
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,529
that's an interesting opportunity to

244
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,180
learning how do you bring virtually all

245
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,880
these universities together and

246
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,880
collaborate because I sometimes

247
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,839
universities don't like to collaborate

248
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,300
they like to do their own thing

249
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
and so bringing many universities

250
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,370
together to collaborate has been another

251
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,779
learning experience that we've had here

252
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,670
are the universities that are currently

253
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:45,770
involved I'll get all the way so you can

254
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,660
see the list University of Texas pops up

255
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,250
and I think they had some of that stuff

256
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:54,260
on the panel too so interesting just a

257
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,959
little note about Mississippi State one

258
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,870
of the serendipities of this program is

259
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,180
they did a lot of work on SCADA systems

260
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,890
and one of the semesters the students

261
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,689
actually developed a SCADA simulator and

262
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,420
part of the insure project is not losing

263
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,070
all that knowledge and so in our hub

264
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,439
there is a simulator that can be reused

265
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,350
by anybody who wants to continue doing

266
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,090
skater work along with the data to see

267
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,630
if you can reproof reproduce that data

268
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,190
set and then continue that work so it's

269
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,910
really interesting here's all the

270
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,070
sponsors NSA has been in the lead since

271
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,829
the beginning we have a healthy group

272
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,880
you heard a bill Layton

273
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,600
mentioned last time he's one of our lead

274
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,810
technical directors that have been

275
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,150
helping out with the students this

276
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,520
particular but he knows Indiana Office

277
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,189
of Technology has gotten involved and we

278
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,490
continue to increase the amount of

279
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,530
organizations who want to participate

280
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,050
because they too don't have the ability

281
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,100
to get to some of this research

282
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,120
cybersecurity fundamentally is

283
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,450
unclassified the science of it how we

284
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,340
apply it just to be classified but the

285
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,320
fundamental science is not classified

286
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,590
and that's how we can actually do this

287
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,300
project the results and this is really

288
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,500
interesting and you know I know that

289
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,010
Melissa and I probably thought about

290
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,320
this over coffee but what is come after

291
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,620
five years of doing this is this

292
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,260
persistent geographically independent

293
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,850
virtual network now of all these

294
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,790
universities the professors and the

295
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:35,480
students and and the technical directors

296
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,060
of this collaborative nature of work on

297
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,820
problem sets and then those problem sets

298
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,569
are evolved based upon the work that has

299
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,280
been done in the past semesters to

300
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,700
evolve that particular problem set

301
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:53,870
either to say we're done or we need to

302
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:57,620
refine and continue on the the real

303
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,230
research challenges that have happened

304
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,380
many students and and when we get people

305
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:08,090
at NSA we find that they don't have a

306
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:11,540
whole lot of of skill sets in doing

307
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,280
sustained research virtually because in

308
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,760
the NSA fabric as well as the rather

309
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,230
agency fabrics I can only talk NSA but

310
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,950
my colleagues that I've spoken with have

311
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,170
voiced similar aspects is we don't do

312
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,180
anything just in one location it's all

313
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,640
virtual

314
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,640
and that research is ongoing and has a

315
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,280
life of its own so teaching these

316
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,199
students how to do that virtual research

317
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,850
has shortened the the time to work

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
because when we hire them in the agency

319
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,590
we find that we have to put them in

320
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,990
internship programs to teach them how to

321
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,240
do the business by going through

322
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,310
something like ensure that shortens that

323
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,350
time frame or they can actually then get

324
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,479
to work right away so this is one of

325
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,750
those attributes I think that probably

326
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,390
we thought about on the napkin but has

327
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,770
really turned out to be one of a pretty

328
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:08,170
big benefit our future was in sure I

329
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,630
think Melissa correct me if I'm wrong

330
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,349
but I think we're at that cuspid of we

331
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:16,860
normally have about 78 universities and

332
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,440
about 50 some-odd students each semester

333
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,830
but we're brokering on that going larger

334
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,260
aspect there's complications with that I

335
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,710
know it's Davis right University of

336
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,300
California Davis is on a quarter system

337
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,820
so how do you synchronize a quarter

338
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,069
system with a semester system that's a

339
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,690
challenge because all the students get

340
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,610
together and give their midterm reports

341
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,050
and their final reports and so that

342
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,350
synchronization is an interesting

343
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,000
challenge how do you make sure that we

344
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,490
don't get so many students who are

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,310
interested that we have overcome our

346
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,080
pool of technical directors because the

347
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:58,209
technical directors are doing this out

348
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:00,850
of their own personal interest and when

349
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,580
I first pitched this to NSA our

350
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,070
information assurance director basically

351
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,260
said I love the program don't cost me

352
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,740
any money

353
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,660
so that's way it is with government that

354
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,480
they love to support but just don't cost

355
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,880
me any money so these are some of the

356
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,940
things that we're looking at as coming

357
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,260
up with a more collaborative repository

358
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,750
to do the data store sharing of the data

359
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,069
it really has proven this persistent

360
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:36,040
access to knowledge to students and

361
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:38,980
availability so in summary what insurer

362
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,319
has done is proved that we can

363
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,589
fully bring multiple universities

364
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,570
together to do these these collaborative

365
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,399
classes the students surprised us

366
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,339
Melissa and I were talking about should

367
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,970
we instantiate a multi University team

368
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,490
and that semester some folks from Purdue

369
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,339
I think was Dakota got together and said

370
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,500
hey we wanted this multi University team

371
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,500
is that okay with you so the students

372
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,339
self actuated and brought this together

373
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,070
great stuff there the agency

374
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,199
collaboration we have the same primary

375
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,500
universities do you know NSA

376
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,510
collaborating with Sandia with with with

377
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,850
all the other agencies we just don't

378
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,410
have time so this help forced us into

379
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,810
that and we discovered some great

380
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,550
channels of that so I think I'm going to

381
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,199
stop there because I think I'm getting

382
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,810
the the two-year mark of the two-year

383
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,339
mark the two-minute mark because I'd

384
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,518
like to as you can see I'm not very

385
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,839
enthusiastic about this program but

386
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,339
would like to open it up for any type of

387
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,779
questions that you might have and

388
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,510
Melissa's here to answer stuff that I

389
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:46,089
can't answer it's really a great program

390
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,910
looking forward to continuing it and

391
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,029
looking forward to the challenges of

392
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:57,819
continuing it which are are not simple

393
00:16:52,029 --> 00:17:02,560
to overcome but any questions it's after

394
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:03,790
lunch any questions answered everything

395
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:10,540
that you can ever know about ensure

396
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:12,010
there's somebody so I'm curious how you

397
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,809
engage the students and keep your

398
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,579
secrets secret I mean what's to stop a

399
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,949
student from going to work somewhere

400
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,379
else like with a bad guy somewhere yeah

401
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:22,660
excellent question and it's one that we

402
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,910
internal to NSA had a great conversation

403
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,850
about before we really stepped out and

404
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,130
got involved and it's founded on the

405
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:34,299
fact that the science is is unclassified

406
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:37,059
and that we need to utilize as much

407
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,610
research as we can and we've got this

408
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,740
great pool of super minds and we're

409
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,370
actually tapping into bachelor degree

410
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,559
programs now as well there's no

411
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,889
requirement to be a u.s. citizen to be

412
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,100
part of ensure and so it's not lost on

413
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,170
us

414
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,689
that some of that in t'lie

415
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,630
we'll probably go places that that we

416
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,660
prefer not go but that's going to happen

417
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,700
anyway okay it's it's not just because

418
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,700
ensure these problems are not

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,280
necessarily specific to the government

420
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:16,270
they're problems that we are interested

421
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,639
in and so we'd like to pursue those

422
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,530
particular problem sets but it's not

423
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,559
unique to the government and that's how

424
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,750
we keep it unclassified everything we

425
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,690
send out is 100% scrubbed by our folks

426
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,030
to make sure it is 100% unclassified not

427
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,960
even for official use only but generic

428
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:38,139
unclassified public releasable problem

429
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,570
sets that we go out those US citizens

430
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,090
who participate like the one gentleman

431
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,040
who we then brought in cleared and

432
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,570
brought back into NSA and in fact

433
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,490
offered him a job and he's going to come

434
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,260
work for us

435
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,910
we take that very seriously as well it

436
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,549
takes about six to eight months to clear

437
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,350
someone and so that process is most

438
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,540
people here worked with the government

439
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,070
know it takes a long time so we realize

440
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,690
that some of this intellects going to go

441
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,230
to Microsoft someone's going to go to

442
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,419
Juniper Cisco and we say outstanding

443
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,990
because that intellects going to make

444
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:12,130
those products more secure and remember

445
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,260
rising tide floats all boats

446
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,750
and so we know we're going to float the

447
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,049
adversary boat as well but hopefully

448
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,590
we're floating our boat in that process

449
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:26,200
and and being innovative in how we use

450
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:35,049
this this technology is kind of what we

451
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:36,880
depend on Oh industry would love to have

452
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,440
industry involvement obviously in

453
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,299
problem definition might be a little bit

454
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,090
more difficult because of intellectual

455
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:45,340
property rights but right now we've got

456
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,639
a wealth of database of very intelligent

457
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,870
students and their work product I don't

458
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
know if industry would be interested in

459
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,570
seeing that if you're looking at hiring

460
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,309
someone so that is where I think the

461
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,649
return on investment to industry is is

462
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:02,559
if industry and we're looking at

463
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,559
different ways of funding ensure for the

464
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,760
future and so we're looking at different

465
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,320
avenues

466
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,690
for that to sustain this effort

467
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,480
obviously we've got a great pool of

468
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,410
research problems a great pool of data

469
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,450
that's already been worked

470
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,809
I'm sure industry if they had access to

471
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,720
that could say oh that sparks an idea

472
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:24,129
for us to innovate and create a product

473
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,040
okay that's another return on investment

474
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,260
as well as I mean Hans we did not get

475
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,190
into NSA he's working for a very

476
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,390
wonderful company and we applaud that

477
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,760
because now we know that intellect is

478
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,410
helping that company on doing that so

479
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,570
there's lots of different avenues I

480
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,190
think for industry to get involved and

481
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,800
that's one of the things we're starting

482
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,900
to explore in our growth pattern is how

483
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,020
to involve industry in a way that they

484
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,880
can benefit and and that the students in

485
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:58,590
government can benefit great question

486
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,590
thank you yes sir

487
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,050
the security the question was what are

488
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,640
we doing about the security of the

489
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,490
Internet and can these programs address

490
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,250
it I think what this type of program can

491
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,970
do is continue the research and the

492
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,650
fundamentals of security for the

493
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,350
Internet you know the internet was not

494
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:29,340
designed for security and so you've got

495
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:32,820
a legacy system that is that rejects the

496
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,040
foundations of security in its in its

497
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,500
initial design and so many of us have

498
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,240
legacy legacy systems it's very hard to

499
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,460
go back and patch a legacy system

500
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,110
because it will break it we heard some

501
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:49,080
of that in the in the talk of the formal

502
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:52,199
methods I know of systems that are still

503
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,330
running COBOL how many COBOL programmers

504
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,490
are in the room okay see a couple of us

505
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,149
can raise our hands but not that many of

506
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:03,300
us so we do have jobs sustainability by

507
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,680
the way so very difficult to do that so

508
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,659
I think what we're trying to do is look

509
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,220
at the landscape from a security

510
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,170
challenge what security challenge are

511
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,820
posed by the internet what security

512
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,920
challenge or pose where we can improve

513
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,050
that and then those turn into research

514
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,200
projects at the unclassified level on

515
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,030
the foundations of the science of

516
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,310
computer security and cyber security as

517
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,860
it might relate to the Internet and then

518
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,379
that work might come inside the agency

519
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,520
to further how we how we look at at

520
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,520
protecting the Internet

521
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,280
right yes well and I think the general

522
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,790
mention that - it's all about the

523
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,700
information and and I think the the

524
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,399
thinking of having innovative thought on

525
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,540
how do we protect the information

526
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,260
irrespective of the system it's being

527
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,720
shared on those innovative thoughts and

528
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,610
knowing what we know now about security

529
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,190
would be interesting to look at how do

530
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:10,010
we encapsulate that information have

531
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,990
high assurance on on the entity that

532
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,900
needs access whether it be a human or

533
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,840
whether it be a process etc and if you

534
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,550
can associate those two together with a

535
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,970
high level of assurance I don't care

536
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,980
what network you run it on yeah and so I

537
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,320
think those attributes of how do you do

538
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,840
that in in time I was talking with

539
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,000
somebody over lunch I don't know if you

540
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,040
guys remember dr. tao back in the 90s

541
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,860
who wrote jim sauce I don't know if that

542
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,870
operating system see some smiles gem

543
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,179
sauce was a wonderfully a one certified

544
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,830
formal methods operating system it would

545
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,160
bring an eighty eighty eight chip to its

546
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,169
knees in operation but it was used just

547
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,680
way ahead of his time it was a very

548
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,810
secure kernel it was a very small kernel

549
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,790
etc so those thoughts and ideas of how

550
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,129
to protect information how do we do that

551
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,070
today how do we bring those attributes

552
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,870
of protecting information in our

553
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,879
computing environment and maybe take a

554
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,949
step back and say why are we protecting

555
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,870
the network what are we doing to protect

556
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,630
the information and to protect those who

557
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:19,189
gain access to that information versus

558
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:21,290
the network yeah great question great

559
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,890
thank you very much it's really great to

560
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,889
work with Purdue

561
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,760
you
