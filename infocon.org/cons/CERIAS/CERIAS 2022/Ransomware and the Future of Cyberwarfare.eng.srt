1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
welcome to the serious seminar this week

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,680
um we have with us uh Maggie uh mcelpine

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,700
California McAlpine uh from uh miter uh

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,559
she's gonna speak to us about ransomware

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,540
in the future of cyberware go ahead and

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,520
take it away Maggie thank you so you can

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
you can see the title screen right not

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,539
the notes version

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,500
we'll launch right into it guys thank

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,060
you for your patience really apologize

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,500
about that

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,660
um just a quick disclaimer this this Set

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,039
uh this presentation was actually put

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,900
together back when I first agreed to do

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,520
this panel uh when I was still at Cyber

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,739
reason I'm since moved on to miter in

17
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,020
the last few months so if there's uh

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,100
stuff that's a little bit out of date

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,500
again I deeply apologize

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
um this is not what we're what I've been

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
working on these days but it should be

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,899
give or take two months depends on how

23
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,460
bleeding edge you want to be

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,260
um but basically what I'd like to get

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,800
into is a little bit first I will uh

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,780
just introduce myself my name is Maggie

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,800
McAlpine

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,239
um in the past I've been I've been in

29
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,559
the cyber security world for about 12

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,140
years now I've been

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,100
um in and out of a lot of

32
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,899
security-minded startups as well as the

33
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,820
election security world uh probably best

34
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,500
known if you were to like Google me for

35
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,119
other appearances uh doing election

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,979
security work with the Defcon voting

37
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,960
machine hacking Village

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,799
um and back and back in uh beginning of

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,320
August actually I moved on to minor uh

40
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,640
where I'm with the center for threat and

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,979
form defense with which is a non-profit

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,600
um geared towards creating a minor

43
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,820
attack friendly tools for practitioners

44
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,280
on a pro bono basis uh really some

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,340
Fantastic Tools coming out of there

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,720
um but I continue to be personally

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,420
fascinated by ransomware so uh and and

48
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
the criminals that conduct it and what

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,439
it could possibly mean for the future um

50
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,119
as this presentation says of cyber

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,079
warfare so um I I don't totally know the

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,119
the breadth of experience with um

53
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,040
ransomware and Tech in this audience so

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,360
if I say anything that's terribly

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,100
condescending please forgive me this is

56
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,600
meant to be given to a wide audience and

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
I like to open with um the definition of

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,340
ransomware just so that anybody who

59
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,020
somehow ended up in this room in this

60
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
audience uh who's been who doesn't know

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,079
what it is and is at this point too

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,520
afraid to ask

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
um Can can quickly get up to speed uh so

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,258
I use the asisa.gov definition of

65
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,239
ransomware from 101 uh as the

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,520
ever-evolving form of malware designed

67
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
to basically encrypt your files um and

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,420
hold them against you you know extort

69
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,480
them against you it is uh you know one

70
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,099
of the things I find most interesting

71
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,420
quote unquote you know obviously

72
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,099
ransomware is terrible and that goes

73
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,120
throughout we're going to say that

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,680
throughout this but like one of the

75
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,819
things I find most personally

76
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,319
interesting about ransomware is it's

77
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,780
sort of of a return to form for one of

78
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,580
the oldest forms of crime and extortion

79
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,260
I have something that you want and I

80
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,520
will give it back to you when you give

81
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,739
me money and then you just have to

82
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,319
decide if you're going to pay and uh

83
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,519
whether or not you trust a criminal to

84
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,959
actually give it back to you after

85
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,060
you've paid if you do

86
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,660
um so with this in mind uh let's dive

87
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,760
into kind of the forms that ransomware

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,519
has taken it's basically ramped up over

89
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,739
the years so

90
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,560
um this is a just sort of a rough rough

91
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,540
timeline obviously slightly out of date

92
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,940
of some of these attacks and the only

93
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
thing I don't like about this particular

94
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,379
one this name's just some fairly major

95
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,540
uh attacks that have existed over the

96
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,480
past what like 30 years now

97
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,140
um

98
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,300
but and going all the way back to the

99
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,580
original malware but it doesn't really

100
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,200
show the logarithmic increase that we've

101
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,300
had in ransomware since I want to say

102
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,580
the mid-20 teens

103
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,620
um the real there's been some question

104
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,900
around why there's been this sort of

105
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,300
sharp rise in ransomware back in like I

106
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,459
want to say 2016 2017 uh we saw more

107
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,379
um small-scale ransomware we saw it

108
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,180
hitting individuals we saw it hitting

109
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,400
civilians like Grandma you know give us

110
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
500 and you will unlock your computer

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,379
for you again and there was even a

112
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,879
certain degree of Mercy that we would

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
see in the early days where like if a

114
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,580
criminal hit somebody who like an

115
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,980
individual who like really couldn't pay

116
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,780
um they might let them go and that is

117
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,099
just not the case anymore it's become

118
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,840
completely industrialized they're going

119
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,299
after big targets they're going after

120
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,420
um people who can you know pay money uh

121
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,340
good money so uh and what this has been

122
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,379
aided by we can we can debate it might

123
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,819
be increased processing power that

124
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,000
allows quick encryption uh but also one

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,699
major like point of maybe not blame but

126
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,440
just uh you know cause for why we've

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,820
seen this huge increase in ransomware

128
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,560
over the last few years is most likely

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
to do with um cryptocurrency uh making

130
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
it possible to quickly move that money

131
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
from one place to the other without you

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
know all the other difficulties one

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,180
might have had before it uh this

134
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,400
Anonymous currency that can be you know

135
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
transferred through various wallets now

136
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,400
the US government has had some success

137
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,620
limit recently in calling back some of

138
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,660
those funds and hopefully that will go a

139
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,479
ways towards just um making ransomware

140
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,000
less popular uh as an attack and maybe

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,280
even slowing it down but uh the

142
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
ransomware has been a sharp increase

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,139
recently so why do why do attackers

144
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,300
choose ransomware specifically

145
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,060
um basically all all hackers are

146
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,280
choosing between several different

147
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,680
um impulses motivations uh how the

148
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
impact Act of their attack the

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,780
complexity of it and the popularity

150
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,620
and like us most most um people most

151
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
most hackers are also people they are

152
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,520
motivated by what is easy and what is

153
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,979
lucrative so they're going to go for

154
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,479
these things

155
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,280
um

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,419
but

157
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,100
I said earlier has become something of a

158
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
mechanized industry

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,580
um it is

160
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,020
I think probably one of the best ways to

161
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,639
Define it is almost as a dark Silicon

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
Valley all of the you know cleverness

163
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,539
and

164
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,400
um you know pipeline that you might see

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,620
at universities for the best talent all

166
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,240
of the um uh r d all of the looking for

167
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
The Cutting Edge tools all of the

168
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
industry tracking all of the uh HR

169
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,740
headaches uh actually exist in these

170
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,560
ransomware uh cartels uh in their

171
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,360
sophistication so we've had something

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,880
recently that was called the Conti leaks

173
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,380
um basically the beginning of the

174
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,419
conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by

175
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,419
Russia uh we had one of the more

176
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,160
foremost ransomware groups the Conti

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
group uh basically declare themselves

178
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,320
openly in favor of Russia which may not

179
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,479
have been wise of them to do because uh

180
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,400
not all of their hackers not all of

181
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,940
their employees were Russian uh and in

182
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,400
fact some of them were Ukrainian

183
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
um it's a little bit not sure I think I

184
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,479
might be behind on this but it's not

185
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,680
entirely sure who released this

186
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,819
information it might have been an

187
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,020
outside researcher it might have been

188
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,600
Insider I think the theory when I saw it

189
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,340
was that it was a you in Ukrainian

190
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,039
Insider who basically released all of

191
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,259
their internal slack and like call logs

192
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,319
and everything all of their excuse the

193
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,880
term all they're bitching about HR a lot

194
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,620
of them wanted to get time off their you

195
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,539
know complaints about how the higher-ups

196
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,520
were getting more profit share than the

197
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,440
grunts down below just all very like

198
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,780
typical corporate stuff uh in a very

199
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,840
funny way and I believe Brian Krebs uh

200
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,800
kreb security is the one who gave uh who

201
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,680
went through all of that and uh

202
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,380
basically disseminated it for easy you

203
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,300
know uh understanding and use so if

204
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,620
you're ever curious about the internal

205
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,960
workings of a dark you know organization

206
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,479
like um Conti ransomware group uh

207
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,100
definitely go check that out that's a

208
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,419
definitely a plug I would want to push

209
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,979
along to you guys

210
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,740
um so that's one reason we're seeing

211
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,120
this mechanization now keep in mind in

212
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,740
the cyber security world we are on the

213
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,900
defensive we are always a cost we always

214
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,699
have to weigh risk

215
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
um versus uh investment so if you're

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,419
going to be in a cyber security company

217
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,060
someday or uh providing cyber security

218
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,699
for a company that you work for you're

219
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,400
gonna have to justify your budget

220
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,720
um you are going to be on the cost side

221
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
and so maybe they don't want to put five

222
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,620
million dollars a year into something

223
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,539
that maybe one in a hundred times is

224
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,120
going to cost us 2 million

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,979
um so that's not the case on the

226
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,479
attacker's side the attacker side they

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,860
are the sales guys they are the profit

228
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,960
guys they get whatever they want they

229
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,180
get the Lamborghinis and the baby tigers

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,639
and all the craziness because they are

231
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,900
the ones who bring home millions of

232
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,919
dollars

233
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,900
um to their companies so it's it's a

234
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,880
really fascinating ecosystem I I think

235
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,259
cartel is perhaps one of the better

236
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,460
words for it in terms of its

237
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,900
sophistication

238
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,479
um but uh at the at the risk of getting

239
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,639
too deep into the Weeds on that I was

240
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,319
going to talk about a few major attacks

241
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,599
that have happened recently

242
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,139
um there was a real cluster of again you

243
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,460
I mean this pejoratively but really

244
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,139
fascinating attacks that happened in uh

245
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,599
last year in the summer of 2021 uh late

246
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,820
spring early summer of 2021.

247
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,399
um we had possibly our uh in the end uh

248
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,260
just to go backwards through that Spring

249
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,520
Hill medical center just to quickly

250
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,279
mention that uh last week less we uh

251
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,080
think that these guys are you know in

252
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,459
any way good

253
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,060
um

254
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,399
ransomware ganks tend to go after uh

255
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,580
targets that cannot um afford to go

256
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,980
offline among those will include

257
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,440
hospitals uh and medical centers and

258
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
there were a lot of ransomware attacks

259
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,779
for example in the Irish healthcare

260
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,660
system during the height of kovid and we

261
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,940
have right now I believe still the first

262
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
case possibly of ransomware leading to

263
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,540
someone's death which was a hospital

264
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,040
that got slowed down by a ransomware

265
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,980
attack such that a infant in the ICU uh

266
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,660
passed sadly passed away and there's

267
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,860
actually evidence but there's a lot of

268
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,779
anecdotal evidence

269
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,519
um from the cyber security World

270
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,040
um from csos of hospitals saying that

271
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,180
they think that the number is much

272
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,220
higher it's just harder to prove when

273
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,779
the slowdown's caused by ransomware

274
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,140
attacks uh lead to Deaths um so just to

275
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,420
be clear this is not just totally like

276
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,459
you know we're going after the evil

277
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,019
capitalist that's kind of like the the

278
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,180
rhetoric that a lot of Russian hackers

279
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,040
will put out there this is this has

280
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
caused deaths

281
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,300
um the the two big ones though um and

282
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,620
I'll end on Colonial because that's the

283
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,519
one that's going to kind of launch me

284
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,600
into the rest of what I'm talking about

285
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,120
uh was the JBS meat supplier and then

286
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
the colonial pipeline the colonial

287
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,720
pipeline uh is an interesting one

288
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,920
because it is

289
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,180
they shut down basically one of the

290
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,940
major oil pipelines of the southeast

291
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,580
United States which effectively counted

292
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,279
as critical infrastructure it provided

293
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,320
um oil and gas for the and fuel you know

294
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,019
for that entire sector the the word got

295
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,240
out that this attack had happened which

296
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
caused a run on gas uh there they had

297
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
not actually run out of Supply yet but

298
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,140
that uh from my election security days I

299
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,300
can say sometimes the appearance of an

300
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,459
attack or an appearance of of a

301
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,680
consequence caused by an attack can be

302
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,440
worse than the attack itself so people

303
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,640
thinking there was going to be a run on

304
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,040
gas caused a run on gas

305
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,640
um that being said uh I've heard uh in

306
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,740
Chatham House Rules talks that actually

307
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,100
even though a colonial pipeline uh was

308
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,980
stopped uh they managed to negotiate

309
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,660
with the attackers which was the dark

310
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,019
side gang they managed to pay them uh to

311
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,060
release the systems within a few days

312
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,459
about I think something like 2 million

313
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,040
at the time in cryptocurrency uh and the

314
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,360
US government was actually able to claw

315
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,399
much of it back later so it's kind of an

316
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,320
interesting success story

317
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,480
it might have it could have gotten a lot

318
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,980
worse uh there was a CSO I overheard who

319
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,660
was tied up in the airline industry who

320
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,220
basically said the hatsfield-jackson

321
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,079
airport Atlanta which is the first or

322
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,820
second largest airport in the United

323
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,500
States was three days away from running

324
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,660
out of fuel uh which would have

325
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,160
completely stalled out the entire

326
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,680
Airline not just a commercial not just a

327
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,459
consumer but also the commercial so

328
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,740
um this raised a this really kind of put

329
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,440
the US government on alert because uh

330
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,620
this attack uh really kind of showed the

331
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,480
vulnerabilities we might have to

332
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,220
something like a ransomware attack if it

333
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,899
gets lucky on that scale

334
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,339
um and how it could an entire

335
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,740
region so that really got everyone kind

336
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,180
of waking up paying attention

337
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,660
um this actually probably should have

338
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,800
moved this one sooner I kind of already

339
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,320
covered it which is just some of the uh

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
some of the uh

341
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
statistics it's it's super out of date

342
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,420
too it's like from 2019 of how much

343
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,160
they've increased over the years

344
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
and uh this increase in the ransomware

345
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
attacks and in the crease in the in the

346
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,660
uh cost of the payment

347
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,820
but let's just jump forward a little bit

348
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,140
to

349
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,180
um how are they forcing these guys to

350
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,019
pay

351
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,700
um

352
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,160
the reason as I mentioned earlier

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
they're going to go after targets that

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,360
have a a short amount of time to make

355
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,820
this decision uh one one just Pro tip

356
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,320
for your personal life is you can kind

357
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,540
of spot a fraudster or scammer by the

358
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,920
fact that they're going to try to force

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,380
you to make a decision while your um

360
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,000
brain is on fire while you're while

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,980
you're in a state of stress

362
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,380
um now what was so interesting about the

363
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,720
dark side gang uh with the colonial

364
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,519
pipeline hack was that they didn't just

365
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,459
extort with one or two threats they

366
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,779
didn't just say we've got your data pass

367
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,120
we'll give it back they are going to go

368
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,300
after you one two three even four ways

369
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,220
one they're going to do

370
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,540
um once they have your data they're

371
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,800
gonna extort You by doing things like

372
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,839
saying that we're going to tell the news

373
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,399
we're going to tell journalists that

374
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,899
you've been hacked uh we're going to go

375
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,180
after trading so that we're going to let

376
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,800
this information go such that your stock

377
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,200
will be short sale sold if you don't pay

378
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,100
us

379
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
um once or twice we might take all of

380
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,060
this data we have and release it on the

381
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,279
dark web so they're just gonna peace out

382
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,200
every single way they can make you pay

383
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,700
once they have you

384
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,220
um because they are trying to of course

385
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,079
make money and now that they have what

386
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,519
you need what you want they're going to

387
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,980
get it every single way they can

388
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,620
uh and this is just the actual quote uh

389
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,740
from 2020 uh of um one of the things

390
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,240
that dark side put out now what's

391
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
interesting about darkseid's little

392
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,959
little uh rant you know note here is

393
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,639
that they also have some claim to

394
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,920
principles they're saying things like we

395
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,019
don't go after hospitals not always true

396
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,240
uh we don't go after funeral services or

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,339
education universities non-profits and

398
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,500
government sector this is

399
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,060
um interesting because first of all you

400
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,200
have to take their word for it that

401
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,160
they're telling the truth but it's

402
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,300
interesting that they feel that they

403
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,680
need to clarify this because one would

404
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
think that as a criminal you just want

405
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,279
to make as much money as possible

406
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,820
um when really uh they it's actually

407
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,620
seems like it's a recruiting web a

408
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,480
recruiting tool on their side that they

409
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,660
do only go after supposedly these evil

410
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,160
capitalist targets

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,940
um like Colonial Pipeline and others um

412
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,800
and uh

413
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
to phrase this correctly if they are

414
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,839
getting better Talent by recruiting this

415
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,579
way or are they getting more sympathy

416
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,920
from this sort of PR like kind of what

417
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,540
does that say for the sophistication of

418
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,360
the sector which gets me into

419
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,339
um a little little bit of a weird

420
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,139
tangent uh and I hope you'll forgive me

421
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,180
this does build to how ransomware I

422
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,920
think is going to be used in actual

423
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,480
application

424
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,220
um theoretically in real life in cyber

425
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,820
warfare but when I saw this Ransom note

426
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,560
from Darkseid

427
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,480
um I'm a huge history buff

428
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,279
um that's kind of my first Passion my

429
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,980
first love so dark side gang they hacked

430
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,660
the colonial pipeline they realized that

431
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,980
they're in a lot of trouble because this

432
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,199
is not the slow-moving fuel company that

433
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,579
they thought it was who just didn't have

434
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,019
a decent site you know cyber security

435
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,940
defensive posture and that they could

436
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,560
just sort of roll over and make a lot of

437
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,420
money from oh no this was borderline

438
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,740
critical infrastructure now the entire

439
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,899
US government is on them so they put out

440
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,940
a statement saying we didn't know are

441
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,519
bad uh we are apolitical we don't

442
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
participate in geopolitics we just want

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
to make money were criminals but we're

444
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,160
honest criminals

445
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
um and we're going to work with the the

446
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,339
victim to unleash all of this to to take

447
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,779
care of all this and I thought geez that

448
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,639
really reminds me I've seen a note like

449
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,699
this before and uh and this is gonna be

450
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,220
a weird lateral jump but and the answer

451
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,820
was from the 1600s uh there was a pirate

452
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,040
an arch pirate who was quite famous at

453
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
the time but probably doesn't make it

454
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,100
into like the top 10 these days all that

455
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,420
often unless you kind of really know

456
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,019
your stuff same as Henry every he uh was

457
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,360
caught he he would make the claim he was

458
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,519
uh that he was an Englishman who was a

459
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,779
pirate who wouldn't go after English

460
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,760
Targets this gave him a lot of

461
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,500
popularity and fame back in England it

462
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,699
kind of gave him certain amount of

463
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,680
shelter uh he was basically only

464
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
supposedly going after English enemies

465
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,139
now uh this was not entirely true as I

466
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,019
said uh criminals tend to lie sometimes

467
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,839
uh Henry every puts out a letter after

468
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
he's caught going after English ships

469
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,699
and he said he wouldn't go after uh and

470
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,459
he basically said I you know this is a

471
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,620
lie I've never I am yet an englishman's

472
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,199
friend uh and I would never do this and

473
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,360
and uh I might be a criminal but I'm an

474
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,740
honest one uh so I sort of was going oh

475
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,940
well that's interesting why are these

476
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,620
criminals both kind of echoing each

477
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,759
other why are they putting these

478
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,320
principles forward why aren't they just

479
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,699
saying yeah I'm a criminal I just get it

480
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,079
you know you know money wherever I can

481
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,120
and I would never hit State targets

482
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
State targets that might get me in

483
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,540
trouble and I began to dig a little bit

484
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,480
more and Ryan Krebs uh put an

485
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,160
interesting tweet out around the

486
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,220
colonial pipeline hack where he said

487
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
um

488
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,820
basically that the the colonial pipeline

489
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,759
hack had a bit of code in it to prevent

490
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,439
Russian targets from being hit so

491
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,880
remember Henry every doesn't go after

492
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,740
English targets

493
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,679
um the dark side gang was was um putting

494
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,400
in

495
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
um a line of code that basically made it

496
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,119
so that anyone who had the Cyrillic

497
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,099
alphabet as their primary keyboard on

498
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,599
the computer would be avoided by the

499
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,119
ransomware and that was to basically not

500
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,980
um make a mess where they eat so they

501
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,839
wouldn't get they were sheltered in

502
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,059
Russia and they did not want to run end

503
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,880
up on the wrong side of all of that

504
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,919
um and I thought well that's interesting

505
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,600
that's a little bit like the way Pirates

506
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,640
would run up of the flag the Pirates

507
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,020
didn't usually fly under the Jolly Roger

508
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,460
they would fly up the flag of the ship

509
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,320
they were about to attack

510
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,299
um that is so that they would have uh

511
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,400
you know camouflage up until they got

512
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,020
fairly close

513
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,880
um and also avoid

514
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,940
um you know law enforcement you know

515
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,799
uh retaliation I guess to a certain

516
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
amount of extent so you've got this this

517
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
very interesting ransomware gangs are

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,460
now this one attempt to not hit certain

519
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,840
targets well that already makes them

520
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,000
somewhat politically aligned

521
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,940
um and not just blanket criminals and I

522
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
wanted to delve into that a little bit

523
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
uh one last pirate example uh another

524
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,179
one slightly better known name Benjamin

525
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,179
hornigold was a former English Privateer

526
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,280
um who also refused to hit English

527
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,039
targets uh his crew mutinied on him

528
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,200
during a lean year uh basically saying

529
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,640
we can't afford to not go after English

530
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,120
targets anymore uh and he uh was taken

531
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,740
out of command and left that crew maybe

532
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,000
they should have listened to him because

533
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,679
the English came down on them like the

534
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,660
fist of an Angry God

535
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,179
um and he went on to become a pirate

536
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,340
hunter in a story of black hat to white

537
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,679
hat uh you know rehabilitating quote

538
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,299
unquote these these uh former black hat

539
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,280
hackers to now go after their former

540
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,740
competitors and colleagues

541
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,960
um and so so it just sort of further

542
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
reinforced this parallel and in this way

543
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
that maybe

544
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,559
um Pirates and hackers today are acting

545
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,700
similarly and I actually found this to

546
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,780
be a very

547
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,220
um not just compelling but but

548
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,799
encouraging parallel because piracy has

549
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,660
been with us pretty much as long as as

550
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,059
ocean Seaside you know Seabourn Commerce

551
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,860
has existed there's been people stealing

552
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,780
things on the ocean and we've been

553
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,340
projecting force on the ocean for as

554
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,900
long as I suppose anyone could make a

555
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,179
boat uh in terms of warfare and things

556
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,400
like that so are we seeing sort of this

557
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,500
Evolution where um the internet is

558
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,080
almost becoming its own ocean uh where

559
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,580
project where power is projected there

560
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,799
where nation states tangle there where

561
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,000
uh Commerce takes place where

562
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,100
communication takes place for Consumer

563
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,140
um interactions take place and we're

564
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,320
consumer uh assets and data exists now

565
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,059
too and

566
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,640
um and as this as this territory becomes

567
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
more real more sophisticated are we

568
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,640
maybe needing to better Define for a

569
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
wider audience how not all hackers are

570
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,740
just criminals some of them are State

571
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,559
aligned some of them are maybe uh better

572
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,280
described as Navy for example just to

573
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,720
jump up to here the nation state

574
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,820
connection

575
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,200
are they state sponsored or state

576
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,299
ignored which is what I was classifying

577
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,340
as a privateer essentially

578
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,940
um

579
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,760
are they completely Criminal Just Money

580
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,320
Motivated they'll go after anyone

581
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,299
including their own grandma or or are

582
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,400
they for example completely State

583
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,900
aligned so I would argue for example

584
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,700
that North Korean hackers should never

585
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,700
really be defined as purely criminal uh

586
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,940
and it's uh almost um dishonest to

587
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,320
Define them as such because it's not

588
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,240
like anybody in North Korea has a

589
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,679
computer that they're using without like

590
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,620
State you know encouragement uh within

591
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,600
the state structure so if you think of

592
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
North Korea as sort of like a Navy then

593
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,380
you think about

594
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,720
um the Russian hacker Army uh which has

595
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
this sort of interesting permeable

596
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
relationship with those in power in

597
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,419
Russia where they might lean on them for

598
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,919
certain tasks

599
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,780
um they might lean on them a bit harder

600
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,419
when they're expected to participate in

601
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,679
certain tasks one way or the other

602
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,380
because they get shelter from them

603
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
um or do they

604
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:57,900
um

605
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,059
uh do they actively you know work for

606
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,440
the gru

607
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
um you know how is that relationship

608
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,460
there and then there's also and this is

609
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,720
a little I don't delve quite as much

610
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,580
into them but there's also some question

611
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,200
about the Privateer connection around

612
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,179
say some Chinese hackers who might work

613
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,500
for the Chinese government but the

614
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,640
attack they're doing is on their own

615
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
time so kind of like we've given you a

616
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,140
ship we have these targets you want to

617
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,220
hit if you want to hit these other

618
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,780
targets as long as they're on the allow

619
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,820
list it's fine you can make you can

620
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,080
enrich yourself you can improve your

621
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,299
skills you can uh improve you know you

622
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,740
can make your own profits on the side is

623
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,200
kind of part of the bonus package of of

624
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,720
keeping those skills up to Snuff so

625
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,299
there we it's kind of a I think

626
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,860
ultimately a useful metaphor for

627
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,500
describing these relationships to people

628
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,360
like policy makers people who might not

629
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
be deep in the cyber security World

630
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
um to better discuss these things like

631
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,820
are these people working for the Russian

632
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,200
government or for the Chinese government

633
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
for the Iranian government

634
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,960
um

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,659
uh yes or no and to what extent and do

636
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,580
they always do so how sheltered are they

637
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,380
you know Etc

638
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,880
so

639
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,200
uh we mentioned the kill switch in this

640
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,659
really keyword uh just the the note

641
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,240
about money laundering yeah um last note

642
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,799
on on this sort of weird permeable

643
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,380
relationship between ransomware gangs in

644
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,179
um Russia is that the number one uh

645
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,200
cryptocurrency Exchange in the country

646
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
is in the same building as like the

647
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,720
office of one of the foremost ransomware

648
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,900
gangs like they share a skyscraper so

649
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,299
it's just to kind of show that like

650
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,700
their these these relationships can be

651
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
quite cozy

652
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,940
um and just kind of down the hall levels

653
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,159
of aloud so at one point right before

654
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,900
the right when the war with Ukraine was

655
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,120
about to kick off or just kicked off uh

656
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,720
Russia put out a you know arrested

657
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,940
um uh one of the ransomware gangs it

658
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,740
might have been rival or dark side I

659
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,659
think it was Revel yeah evil

660
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,179
um and uh there's a big video of it very

661
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,919
dramatic there these guys are in cuffs

662
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,240
they've got bags over their heads Etc

663
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,980
but it's like I would love to know the

664
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,400
ending of that movie because I have no I

665
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,620
don't think we have any proof that these

666
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,179
guys actually ended up in any kind of

667
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,520
jail especially because they might have

668
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,740
just been uh voluntold to help out with

669
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,419
the Ukraine effort after this so who

670
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,120
knows what really happened there

671
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,900
um

672
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,600
but what they told the United States was

673
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,460
look you should you should get out of

674
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,260
our way you should let us do what we

675
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,760
want to do to Ukraine because otherwise

676
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,860
we're going to let these ransomware

677
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,020
gangs just run amok

678
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
um and

679
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,260
which is like well how is that any

680
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,220
different from what you've been doing

681
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,080
before but but the tacit you know the

682
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
the tacit sort of Shakedown aspect of

683
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
that was you know you better play nice

684
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
with us or we're just going to shelter

685
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,580
every hacker criminal in the world and

686
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,840
we're going to turn them outwards at you

687
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,159
and there's nothing you can do about it

688
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,900
because we have nukes and you can't just

689
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
like come in and black bag these guys

690
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
um so that's all very interesting I do

691
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,679
Wonder because I don't know because a

692
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,000
lot of this presentation was first

693
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,559
formulated before the invasion of

694
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,840
Ukraine I and I still don't necessarily

695
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,919
have an answer in this it might take a

696
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,120
while for us to get the answer on this

697
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,980
but how has this current recruitment

698
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,900
Drive happening in the in in Russia

699
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,720
impacted that threat how many people

700
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,820
especially like very smart people are

701
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,980
moving to Russia right now how much are

702
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,539
they actually

703
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,380
um

704
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,200
shall we say uh you know able to recruit

705
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,780
I don't even necessarily since uh just

706
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,539
as an example in March alone uh April

707
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,400
1st is the first day of like internet of

708
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,260
like National recruitment day in Russia

709
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,039
from March to April the number of tech

710
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,400
people who fled uh Russia in the fears

711
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
that the Border would get locked down

712
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,659
was five percent of the entire sector in

713
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,520
one month

714
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,280
um that dipped down a bit I think when

715
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,080
when when it didn't look like that that

716
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,059
draft was going to happen well I imagine

717
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,919
it's probably ticking back up again too

718
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,960
so I I don't know what their talent is I

719
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
wonder how soft the targets are in

720
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,559
Russia right now as far as that hacker

721
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,559
Army um they they are a little bit

722
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,640
suffering on the tech front because

723
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
people who have Tech skills are the most

724
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
like able to get out of the country they

725
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,179
are the most worst so it I I don't have

726
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,440
a conclusion on this it's just something

727
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,720
I find interesting to watch um with an

728
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,520
eye to the long term which is what is

729
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,900
their Tech sector and even their

730
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,580
criminal Tech sector looking like right

731
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,240
now

732
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,860
um in the wake of all of this

733
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,080
and now that they're not a desirable

734
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,299
destination to go to maybe as a criminal

735
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,780
uh to avoid prosecution somewhere else

736
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,299
so

737
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,460
I I sort of the promise of this

738
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,440
presentation obviously was that we were

739
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,880
going to get into ransomware

740
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,240
specifically as a tool of cyber warfare

741
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,820
um so I wanted to run through a few

742
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,640
recent fairly cutting-edge examples of

743
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
how this has happened and while I will

744
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,360
pick up on Russia a bit more uh just

745
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,919
because the Ukraine conflict is kind of

746
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,539
like brought a lot of attention on their

747
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,799
cyber warfare

748
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
um activities and their cyber in their

749
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,460
hacking activities I will pick on a

750
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,500
couple of other countries too so we'll

751
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,240
just quickly get one of them out of the

752
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,940
way there was an interesting case uh of

753
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,340
ransomware being used as camouflage by

754
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,779
uh Iranian

755
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,360
um government for you know government

756
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,980
organizations basically what they were

757
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,260
doing was I would say almost the Cyber

758
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,960
work like the Cyber equivalent of um

759
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,580
assassinating somebody and then taking

760
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,080
their wallet to make it look like they

761
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,059
had been mugged uh randomly rather than

762
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,440
that it was targeted by some sort of

763
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,880
government agency so they used

764
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,460
ransomware to go after

765
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,760
um this the victim in this case

766
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,140
and uh but didn't actually like

767
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,020
necessarily want a money they didn't

768
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,640
need or want money what they did was

769
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
they they encrypted all those files and

770
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,299
then they went through them uh for the

771
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,320
Espionage

772
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
um materials that they wanted and

773
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
there's a lot of possible reasons why

774
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,279
they they use specifically ransomware

775
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,559
um to encrypt all of this and to you

776
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,820
know have and go through the motions of

777
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,020
like making a demand and things like

778
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,100
that

779
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,720
because

780
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,779
um

781
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,620
maybe it was the best tool obviously

782
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,179
money is a huge motivator probably moves

783
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,919
a lot faster than government so maybe

784
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,600
they were using that as one of the the

785
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,220
best ways to lock down those systems and

786
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,360
get them in their own custody they might

787
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,260
have done it to hide their own

788
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,179
government involvement they might have

789
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,620
done it to

790
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,020
um to uh

791
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,059
you know basically well I guess those

792
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,919
are the two reasons to hide um so I

793
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:11,940
thought that was very interesting just

794
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,860
as a first sort of low-key example

795
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,740
ransomware and and cyber warfare uh

796
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,320
ransomware being focused on

797
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,600
um money is still always going to be the

798
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
dominant use right uh because it is

799
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,140
that's what it's for that's what the

800
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,460
criminals who make it are after it's

801
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,020
what the primary motivator is at the end

802
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,340
of the day so keep in mind some of these

803
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,620
are somewhat Fringe examples

804
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,960
um but likewise cyber warfare is almost

805
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,000
always still focused largely on

806
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,559
Espionage and there's quite a few

807
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,720
reasons for that I going into the

808
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,299
Ukraine conflict uh thought that we

809
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,980
would see an uptick I think many people

810
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,779
did an uptick in like the sort of

811
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,100
attacks that would actually shut down

812
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,480
systems

813
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,279
um but it still seems to be primarily

814
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,500
Espionage and things like that which and

815
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,640
and trying to knock out satellite

816
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,400
systems and whatnot uh those seem to be

817
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,659
the primary goals partially it seems

818
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,220
because like they don't stay down for

819
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,860
long it's easier to just mortify uh you

820
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,659
know a an electrical grid rather than

821
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,159
take it down with a hack but also

822
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,779
there's a problem where it tends to

823
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,600
spread read Gru has been noted several

824
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
times create I think uh there's been a

825
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,799
couple of very high profile instances of

826
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,659
the gru attacks actually spreading

827
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,179
beyond the ear intended targets uh in

828
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,340
Eastern Europe to the Western World and

829
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,620
even to themselves so uh that's another

830
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,020
reason why cyber warfare is this sort of

831
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,220
like we're going to take down your power

832
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,440
grid might not be the best idea it might

833
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,559
not be as common as we see but to get

834
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,659
back to ransomware

835
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:34,380
um

836
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,900
uh they're another instant when we say

837
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,400
that Ransom is being used in Warfare I

838
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,020
want to also clarify that it's not

839
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,299
always by nation states

840
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,539
um we have seen partisan activity uh in

841
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,700
Belarus before the war broke out in

842
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,900
January

843
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,820
um and at the time I remember I didn't

844
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,520
quite get belarus's involvement and I

845
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
didn't quite get what the the partisans

846
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,240
were trying to stop here but it became

847
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,260
clear after the fact that they were

848
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,820
trying to stop the train systems from

849
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,500
allowing Russian troops to transport be

850
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,960
transported to the border and uh and and

851
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,539
the state of that country is such that

852
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,880
that there's a lot of um popular

853
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
discontent with the current with uh

854
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,220
lukashenko the uh the dictator there

855
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,580
um and uh this was and and those people

856
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,500
the ability scenes uh partisans were

857
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,480
against the invasion of Ukraine for a

858
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,640
variety of reasons obviously so what

859
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,500
they had done was they shut down the

860
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,020
rail system using a is from the sound of

861
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,399
it and off the shelf ransomware attack

862
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,960
which was very interesting and it's

863
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,539
interesting as a expression of how cyber

864
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,159
warfare kind of like going back to that

865
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,899
Privateer comparison cyber attacks are a

866
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,940
bit like Privateer attacks and shipment

867
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,679
you know Naval attacks in that a

868
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,720
individual or a small organization can

869
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,460
punch above their weight class think

870
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,860
Somali pirates who can actually shut

871
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,140
down the shipping lanes of incredibly

872
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,419
powerful and and you know well-funded

873
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,700
Nations uh with just a few fishing boats

874
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,740
think about how these Belarusian

875
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,240
activists were able to shut down the

876
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,100
rail system using off-the-shelf

877
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,840
ransomware tools

878
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,640
um and we're going to get further into

879
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,460
that and how resource resource uh

880
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,679
limited this is and and actually if if

881
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,720
you had the Good Fortune to be at black

882
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,580
hat this year or to watch the keynote it

883
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,500
was Jeff Moss he sort of spoke about

884
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,240
this it's actually really worth seeing

885
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,100
because he talked about the super

886
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,039
powered individual uh the individual who

887
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,840
has the keys to the kingdom in some of

888
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,299
these you know systems that determine

889
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,700
how our world works as far as you know

890
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,980
how websites uh you know are there like

891
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,480
how a private company could

892
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,860
theoretically take an entire country

893
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,659
offline as we saw with a lot of tech

894
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,700
companies denying their services to

895
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,260
Russia and these are just small

896
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,340
organizations they didn't have

897
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,899
necessarily the US governments you know

898
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,700
they just made a principal you know

899
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,899
decision on their part they weren't

900
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:49,140
being told to do this necessarily so in

901
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,480
this world in this new ocean of the sort

902
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,100
of the internet think about the fact

903
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,659
that you know you could just be

904
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,720
ransomware gang who or a partisan group

905
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,940
that is using ransomware tools

906
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,700
um to take out and to stop and to stymie

907
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,159
the goals of major nation states major

908
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,960
Powers nuclear powers

909
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,340
and I just find that you know personally

910
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,899
very interesting

911
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:10,980
um

912
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,500
going back to Conti so

913
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,440
uh another thing uh so we've now talked

914
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,940
about partisans small groups going again

915
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,980
we've talked about you know Espionage by

916
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,200
a nation we've talked about how

917
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,640
um uh

918
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,480
we've talked about how uh just

919
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,340
individuals in places like Belarus could

920
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,919
use ransomware to turn off the goals of

921
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,500
places of larger Powers but also how

922
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,299
these this permeable nature this Russian

923
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,799
hacker Army

924
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,679
um this uh semi-criminal semi-state okay

925
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,720
looked the other way

926
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,220
um stuff how it can actually congeal and

927
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,279
solidify now haunty when they the Conti

928
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
leaks happened because the the Conti

929
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,340
Russian dominant ransomware gang said we

930
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,799
are pro-russia we are against Ukraine

931
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,720
and we want Russia to win this fight and

932
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,820
unfortunately they were all former

933
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,320
Soviet block somebody in there didn't

934
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,140
like what they were saying and said

935
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,600
um don't do that we actually don't agree

936
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,980
with you and they actually did by the

937
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,720
way Conti pull back on those statements

938
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,039
and say well actually you know we really

939
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,539
are a political because apparently it

940
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,860
caused quite a bit of conflict

941
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,960
internally but again you have now

942
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,320
patriotic ransomware cartels who are who

943
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,840
are choosing their targets based on

944
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,299
their National alignment I think Henry

945
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,340
every and um

946
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,220
and uh and Benjamin hornigold choosing

947
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,200
not to go after certain targets maybe to

948
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,760
keep themselves safer at home maybe

949
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,140
because they're actually powerfully

950
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,460
motivated uh by their own country

951
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,380
um and they are using ransomware as a

952
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,080
tool for this uh and I I sort of my

953
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,480
heart kind of goes out to anybody who

954
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,740
might get hit by one of these gangs

955
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,820
which again I think this will be one of

956
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,140
the minority of attacks at least for the

957
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,779
near term but imagine being like the guy

958
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,120
in charge of the Belarusian Railway and

959
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,700
being told like we want we we're not you

960
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,159
can't pay us to make us go away you have

961
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,179
to just

962
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,220
listen to our demands you have to tell

963
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,980
Putin to get out of Belarus or we won't

964
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,320
unlock this train like and it's just

965
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,820
like how the hell am I supposed to do

966
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,779
that

967
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,520
um and and this could have happened with

968
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,860
with Colonial we were actually incred in

969
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,840
the US incredibly lucky that uh the

970
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,580
colonial pipeline attack appeared to

971
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,919
Blink the attackers blinked and they did

972
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,779
not want to try to hold out for a larger

973
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:22,980
ransom they were too afraid of the

974
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,600
consequences

975
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,159
um because imagine if that had been

976
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,860
someone like Al Qaeda or a a terrorist

977
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,600
organization that really did just want

978
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,059
to drain that area of its oil and gas or

979
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,340
who wanted political prisoners freed or

980
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,440
who wanted some sort of policy decision

981
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,899
to be made as part of the ransom and you

982
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,760
have no way of paying to make this

983
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,279
problem go away so that's just like sort

984
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,799
of some future nightmare scenarios that

985
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,740
are are you know less than great uh and

986
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,120
just something that this tool of

987
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,039
ransomware this very basic return to

988
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,320
form of extortion I have what you want

989
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,659
kind of allows uh these discussions to

990
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,779
happen

991
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,159
um and finally this is a little bit like

992
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,200
this is a little bit like partisans but

993
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,760
it's not because it's like not domestic

994
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,119
but there was also some rumors uh of of

995
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,159
people who were pro-ukraine taking

996
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,839
Russian ransomware and turning them

997
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,540
against Russian companies so this is

998
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,159
actually I think a Finnish group maybe

999
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,739
uh from Finland uh but they basically

1000
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,000
took those again those off-the-shelf

1001
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,918
ransomware attacks they said and they

1002
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,899
said like we don't want money but we're

1003
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,520
gonna lock down all your systems Russian

1004
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,980
company and uh our and we were doing

1005
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,418
this because of Ukraine we're putting it

1006
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,800
right there in the body of the of the

1007
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,500
message uh that this is retaliatory for

1008
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,080
your Invasion this is activists

1009
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,820
um which is another you know fascinating

1010
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,699
I guess uh sort of ominous use of of

1011
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,320
ransomware tools

1012
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,540
now when one of my earlier drafts of

1013
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,219
this again happened right on the verge

1014
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,859
of the invasion uh and I had been

1015
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,659
postulating for some time with this sort

1016
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,179
of pirate Privateer uh Navy argument of

1017
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,139
how we should start thinking about

1018
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,580
ransomware hackers and criminals in

1019
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,020
general

1020
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,680
um

1021
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,380
what what happens when privateers become

1022
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,180
Navy now if you know American history

1023
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,880
you know that our Navy began uh John

1024
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,500
Paul Jones and things like that began as

1025
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,880
a privateer

1026
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,800
um Navy with

1027
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,480
um you know funded by individuals and

1028
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,099
basically given a charter saying just go

1029
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,079
after American targets

1030
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,140
um what happens if that were to come

1031
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,000
back now keep in mind privateers is a

1032
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,380
very difficult

1033
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,119
um Genie to put back in the bottle and

1034
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,300
it took until the mid-1800s uh for the

1035
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,520
European powers to band together uh and

1036
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,140
say that they wanted to ban privateers

1037
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,640
uh partially as a retaliation against

1038
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,960
the United States I don't actually know

1039
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
if we're in that agreement

1040
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,040
um but but there's a huge risk when you

1041
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,599
do things like issue letters of Mark

1042
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,940
which is basically saying you have blank

1043
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,800
check to go after anyone you want as a

1044
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,000
criminal as long as you're going after

1045
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,880
our enemies um in this environment uh

1046
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,280
and that is that the saying goes that uh

1047
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,680
wartime privateers are peacetime Pirates

1048
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,180
you're basically training people to

1049
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,240
build their livelihood around attacking

1050
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,520
organizations uh for-profit and you

1051
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,079
can't necessarily control them when the

1052
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,700
war ends

1053
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,300
um

1054
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,760
so I've seen some mutterings in the

1055
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,079
cyber warfare Community I'm sorry in the

1056
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,579
cyber security Community around like we

1057
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,280
should just be allowed to go after

1058
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,140
um Russian targets for example right now

1059
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,420
and that's like very dodgy uh for a

1060
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,440
variety of reasons I think the history

1061
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,820
kind of illuminated with pirates and

1062
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,640
privateers uh because for example what

1063
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,380
is the condition of Victory what are you

1064
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,700
going after how do you know the system

1065
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,859
you just took out isn't one that like we

1066
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,599
actually like the good guys had like an

1067
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,460
Espionage you know bug planted in and

1068
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,020
that were they were monitoring so

1069
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,060
there's a lot of risks around that uh

1070
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,859
and so I was like oh you know I was kind

1071
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,599
of ending this early versions of the

1072
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,160
presentation saying we should not like

1073
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,839
bring back privateers that's kind of a

1074
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,099
bad idea well then at the beginning of

1075
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,859
the conflict uh Ukraine raised an I.T

1076
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,540
Army basically saying that they didn't

1077
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,920
want to work at Cross Purpose with all

1078
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,180
the anonymous and all the people that

1079
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,300
wanted to help out and they invited them

1080
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,020
to come and help uh Ally with uh

1081
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,839
Ukrainian interests and uh and work

1082
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,839
directly with them to fight back uh I

1083
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,099
have not necessarily followed up on

1084
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,140
where that is yet I don't know there is

1085
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,760
a place to follow that up with it might

1086
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,619
be a long time before we find out where

1087
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,240
some of this stuff all ended up maybe it

1088
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,339
won't be until the history books but it

1089
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,380
is very interesting to have gone from oh

1090
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,700
gee I wonder what happens when these

1091
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,700
like sort of loose cyber uh Privateer

1092
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,460
armies maybe get formalized into more

1093
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,619
serious cyber navies in the future and

1094
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:23,880
what will that look like in a hundred

1095
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,800
years only to have this kind of news

1096
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,900
break like right around a week after I

1097
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,400
had kind of begun to postulate that

1098
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,060
um and that's really where it would have

1099
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,380
ended except two other things happened

1100
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,800
one was the uh Conte ransomware gang

1101
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,720
began to go after sectors of interest to

1102
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,460
the Russian government uh for example

1103
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,260
energy would have been the most sensible

1104
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,640
like just off the top of my head I

1105
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,079
thought of energy because of course

1106
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,099
they're trying to squeeze the global

1107
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,440
markets in order to make a case for

1108
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,520
themselves of um uh you know you should

1109
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,900
let us do whatever we want to Ukraine

1110
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,800
because otherwise we're going to raise

1111
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,140
oil and gas prices uh astronomically we

1112
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,880
went ahead and really considered uh and

1113
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,260
that I felt a little embarrassed that I

1114
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,700
hadn't considered was agriculture which

1115
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,500
is a notoriously under

1116
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,040
um

1117
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
under secured sector as far as cyber

1118
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,940
security goes and um there might have

1119
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,740
been also remember that beginning of

1120
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,660
this we're talking about ransomware uh

1121
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,160
attackers tend to go after things that

1122
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,780
have a short fuse things that like

1123
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,000
people will die if we don't unlock this

1124
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,640
soon and with the grain shortages caused

1125
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,220
by Russia and Ukraine battling it out

1126
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,380
um you know agriculture became one more

1127
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,579
of those sectors that could feel

1128
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,440
squeezed that could lead to deaths that

1129
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,060
could lead to civil unrest if it wasn't

1130
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,480
resolved so was it the Russian

1131
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,520
government directly was it a privateer

1132
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,099
was it a patriotic hacker uh or was it

1133
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,660
just another criminal who just knew that

1134
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,040
agriculture was being squeezed and

1135
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
therefore they could make some money off

1136
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,940
of going after this it's not necessarily

1137
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,859
um immediately always clear but it is

1138
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,619
interesting that energy and agriculture

1139
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,839
uh were being gone at were were being

1140
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,839
attacked at one point this past summer

1141
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,060
um by ransomware gang specifically uh

1142
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,560
and how those dovetailed with government

1143
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,859
interests of Russia and uh and the final

1144
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,180
one

1145
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,599
um all of this had been fairly

1146
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,099
um abstract as far as how does this

1147
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,119
actually have anything to do with

1148
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,060
Warfare you know what what what Warfare

1149
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,579
being you know the uh what is it that

1150
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,859
that quote um my closet or whatever uh

1151
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,839
projection for you know uh diplomacy by

1152
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,700
other means uh how is this actually

1153
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,320
stopping countries how is this actually

1154
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,000
doing more than just inconveniencing

1155
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,400
people or stealing some of their data

1156
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,599
um how is this actually catastrophic

1157
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,460
well Costa Rican government got crippled

1158
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,460
uh by a cyber uh attack a ransomware

1159
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,520
attack specifically this uh passed uh

1160
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,619
earlier this year in April

1161
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,020
um and this is where I I apologize for

1162
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,579
not having being as followed up on this

1163
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,579
as I should be but um I then moved on to

1164
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,400
other things but this is uh is this a

1165
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,140
Harbinger is it at least a Harbinger for

1166
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,359
small countries uh like you know the

1167
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,619
Caribbean countries and things like that

1168
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,420
that they could be next on the target

1169
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,880
for you know getting squeezed uh if they

1170
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,260
don't have the defenses in place to deal

1171
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,180
with a ransomware attack maybe is this

1172
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,460
something we could see the old one of

1173
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,960
the oldest of crimes extortion being

1174
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,579
used between countries

1175
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,339
um you know to bring political pressure

1176
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,880
we are seeing ransomware as a tool used

1177
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,220
by nation states against nation states

1178
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,380
and against nation-state interests in a

1179
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,119
way that it when it first originated it

1180
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,640
was mostly just used against smaller

1181
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,400
individuals organizations businesses to

1182
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,440
get money is this going to expand

1183
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,140
further uh is this maybe one of the

1184
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,760
Hidden tools we haven't been considering

1185
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,380
as far as what the actual future of

1186
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,359
cyber warfare would look like

1187
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,560
um these are all questions I kind of

1188
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,020
wanted to pose to the to the wider

1189
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,300
Community with this presentation

1190
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,720
um but most of all uh just to highlight

1191
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,520
that these tools are being used in this

1192
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,079
environment still in the minority of

1193
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,760
ransomware attacks but who knows whether

1194
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,260
or not that will increase over time

1195
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,900
especially for countries that maybe are

1196
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,460
financially squeezed North Korea uses

1197
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,680
ransomware for example as I mentioned uh

1198
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,420
to to replenish itself you know to get

1199
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,800
around sanctions and to replenish its

1200
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,680
own uh Reserve so you know it is a tool

1201
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,540
out there and tools are meant to be used

1202
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,640
and they are being used in ways that

1203
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,500
mirror some historical events as I

1204
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,300
mentioned privates prior tiers and feed

1205
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,460
into this larger question of what is

1206
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,440
cyber warfare going to look like so I I

1207
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,380
hope this was of interest to all of you

1208
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,240
um I I would love any questions you

1209
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,740
might have

1210
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,420
um if you like those Graphics credit

1211
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,280
goes to cyber reason they are an EDR

1212
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,780
company you should check them out I'm no

1213
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,140
longer with them uh and I uh uh and

1214
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,940
whatnot so we'll just leave that there

1215
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,099
uh and I think we can go to questions

1216
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,020
now so

1217
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,060
yeah

1218
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,779
uh

1219
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,880
hi Maggie yeah thanks

1220
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,619
um looks like we have two questions in

1221
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,240
the Q a and I'll just go ahead and read

1222
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,460
them to you yeah I couldn't see that

1223
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,020
when I was projecting very easily so

1224
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,839
yeah no problem uh let's see first one

1225
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,200
if the human and technical issues that

1226
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,119
make ransomware possible are hard

1227
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,760
problems without Immediate Solutions do

1228
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,740
you think regulation limiting the

1229
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,400
funding mechanism namely cryptocurrency

1230
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,619
is a potential approach to limiting the

1231
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,720
market incentives to these sorts of

1232
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,259
attacks

1233
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,640
um yeah I understand so if we just stop

1234
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,619
using if we limited cryptocurrency could

1235
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,079
we stop ransomware

1236
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,400
um

1237
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,200
I am going to be careful with how I

1238
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,579
announce this because cryptocurrency

1239
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,020
people tend to be very passionate about

1240
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,900
cryptocurrency but I will say I'm I sort

1241
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,980
of see cryptocurrency from the

1242
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,560
perspective of like a cop who only sees

1243
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,480
cash like when it's being used for drug

1244
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,800
deals where you're like I know cash has

1245
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,599
other good uses

1246
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,820
um and and whatnot but yes if we got if

1247
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,079
we all everything was credit card we

1248
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,400
could track everything and then you know

1249
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,200
maybe this problem would go away

1250
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,440
I think it enabled it I think it's more

1251
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,140
of a problem along the lines of

1252
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,480
um the maturity of cryptocurrency you

1253
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,119
know the banking systems around

1254
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,280
um you know cash as we know assets as we

1255
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,440
know it have a lot of anti-money

1256
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,240
laundering stuff going on they've got a

1257
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,680
lot of anti-criminal stuff going on it's

1258
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,780
not perfect obviously but

1259
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,140
um it exists and so I've seen some

1260
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,640
debates and discussions in the

1261
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,319
cryptocurrency community like do how do

1262
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,760
we make it so for example the money

1263
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,859
could be clawed back like it was with

1264
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,599
Colonial pipeline how do we make it so

1265
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,040
that it doesn't end up in criminal hands

1266
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,839
which kind of belies the original Point

1267
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:19,920
as a lot of people see it in

1268
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,980
cryptocurrency so uh and just as a final

1269
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,660
note I know China like more or less

1270
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,400
banned cryptocurrency for a variety of

1271
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,220
reasons so it's part of the discussion I

1272
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,000
don't know if it could it help probably

1273
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,800
um is it worth it I think that's a

1274
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,240
question for people who are more

1275
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
financially minded than me and more

1276
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,960
involved in all of that to to better

1277
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,480
hash out and discuss but it it it's an

1278
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,220
accelerant for ransomware I don't know

1279
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,300
if getting rid of it would just stop

1280
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,920
ransomware though

1281
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,240
um

1282
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,220
um

1283
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,859
uh so I can also just read the yeah and

1284
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:55,079
I can give copies of the slide certainly

1285
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,760
um yeah I had a real quick just a real

1286
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,560
quick thing to add to that do you know

1287
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,780
like have you seen like since the value

1288
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,760
of cryptocurrency has come down has has

1289
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,060
it changed has like there have been less

1290
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,400
has that affected it at all or do you

1291
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
think it will affect it unfortunately

1292
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,640
that kind of fell right in the the

1293
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,380
trough period I described of moving on

1294
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,720
from cyber reason and uh so I I didn't

1295
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,339
quite follow as closely as I would have

1296
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,380
liked to how that impacted things I know

1297
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,160
that there was a Slowdown of sorts in uh

1298
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,440
ransomware which was attributed to a

1299
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,180
variety of things

1300
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,560
um one of them might have been that

1301
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,900
defenses are just getting better on all

1302
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,119
their targets it could be Insurance it

1303
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,680
could be uh yeah it could be

1304
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,200
cryptocurrency being less attractive

1305
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,780
um right but it it's like that's the

1306
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,920
other thing too is you can't always

1307
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,260
interview these guys to ask maybe

1308
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,819
they'll just ask for more if the price

1309
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,380
has gone down

1310
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,960
um so yeah I have to say unfortunately

1311
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,300
that's it I do not know

1312
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,180
great yeah uh I'll I'll go ahead and

1313
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,240
read the next question uh do you see do

1314
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,800
you see expression of values from

1315
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,140
Criminal gangs as a sign of deterrence

1316
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,480
against being targeted by nation-state

1317
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,000
cyber actors they have already figured

1318
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,960
out

1319
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,140
uh how to evade law enforcement

1320
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,960
um like europeal and FBI from a legal

1321
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,880
standpoint but cyber command and

1322
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,680
equivalents in other nations could

1323
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,540
potentially reach out and disrupt the

1324
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,640
their operations

1325
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,220
if they could do if they had cause to do

1326
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,400
so short answer yes uh I do think that

1327
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,220
there's a variety of reasons why they

1328
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,599
would have these expressions of values

1329
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,800
like I said the original one was like

1330
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,960
Recruitment and being able to sleep at

1331
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,160
night and believe in their own mission

1332
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,380
and rally around their own mission but

1333
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,200
yes like Henry every and like hornigold

1334
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,880
they didn't just by the way those guys

1335
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,200
actually did get a certain amount of

1336
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,000
clemency by their claims and many people

1337
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,740
would shelter them who might not have

1338
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,300
otherwise sheltered them because they

1339
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,619
don't you can take shelter in England

1340
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,540
right because like English people know

1341
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,060
you don't attack English ships

1342
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,079
um and you're not just a blanket

1343
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:57,599
criminal but in this case yes uh

1344
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,099
um both in the historical examples end

1345
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,980
today uh there is absolutely a very

1346
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,920
reasonable theory that they were kind of

1347
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,380
going Uncle like please don't hurt us if

1348
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,300
you know we we're just criminals we are

1349
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,380
not working for the Russian government

1350
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,300
we are not trying to shut down critical

1351
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,680
infrastructure

1352
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,720
um please don't nuke us from orbit like

1353
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,180
please don't just like put us on a list

1354
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,400
that gets like you know a SWAT team you

1355
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,380
know at our door SEAL Team Six at our

1356
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,079
door because that is there's two

1357
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,420
theories around why the colonial

1358
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,980
pipeline guys kind of backpedaled and

1359
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,839
freaked out there is what they said that

1360
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,200
was the was you know um their reasoning

1361
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
which is like we're just criminals sorry

1362
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,960
we didn't know this was critical

1363
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,700
infrastructure or sorry please don't

1364
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,099
hurt us uh which is what they said and

1365
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,619
then there is like oh uh the Russian

1366
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:45,359
government did back them they either

1367
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,859
already got what they wanted which was

1368
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,440
seeing how to do this or somebody else

1369
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,000
was you know watching and got what they

1370
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,660
needed um or like they also realized

1371
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,980
that they were escalating further than

1372
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,660
they wanted to so you can believe or not

1373
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,780
believe uh dark side on whether or not

1374
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,579
um they were working with the Russian

1375
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,640
government or not but in either case yes

1376
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,960
there is probably a case to be made for

1377
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,940
them at least believing that it was

1378
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,040
worthwhile to plead that they were just

1379
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,660
criminals and that they were not you

1380
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,040
know Warfare motivated because that

1381
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,500
really is an escalation that actually to

1382
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,000
just go back to Ukraine briefly because

1383
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,140
I spent a lot of time at the beginning

1384
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,520
of the conflict going where is the war

1385
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,920
or like why hasn't there been you know

1386
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,300
the Cyber war that we've been promised

1387
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,220
for decades since like literally I came

1388
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,380
into the field and before and there

1389
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,960
really is that question of escalation

1390
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,280
um you know do you really want to be

1391
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,140
right fighting on 20 fronts uh if you

1392
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,460
start going after everybody who's

1393
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,800
aligned with Ukraine do you really want

1394
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,900
to when you might have all your

1395
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,980
resources tied up and going after

1396
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,140
Ukraine and cyber warfare be also

1397
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,720
defending attacks from U.S and things

1398
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,640
like that and and there's a bit of a I

1399
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,540
think there's actually a bit more of a

1400
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,880
detaunt going on there than people than

1401
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,920
might meet the eye at first

1402
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,420
um more of a gentleman's agreement more

1403
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,740
of a like we're not going to start even

1404
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,760
if we could we're not going to

1405
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,660
necessarily start shutting down each

1406
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,280
other's power grids because like where

1407
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,260
does it end so

1408
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,060
yes I think there was a motivation there

1409
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,859
regardless and I think it's a really

1410
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,000
interesting question and worth

1411
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,800
mentioning again a lot of this is kind

1412
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,079
of just postulation because we don't we

1413
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,220
don't necessarily have those clear

1414
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,359
answers

1415
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,740
um unless you are an intelligence

1416
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,119
officer maybe if you are an intelligence

1417
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,339
officer first of all like I'd love to

1418
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,200
learn more but second of all like you

1419
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,099
know you might have answers you can't

1420
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,240
share yet

1421
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,180
um so anyway uh yeah

1422
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,940
