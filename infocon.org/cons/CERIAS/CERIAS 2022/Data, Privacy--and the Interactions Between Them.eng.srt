1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,100
good afternoon welcome to the series

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,080
weekly security seminar at Purdue

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,180
University uh before we get started just

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,560
want to let everybody know that we have

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,179
the Q a button

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,420
um for the uh if you have questions

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,040
um and also Christine would like to

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,500
interact with you on the chat too so if

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,180
you can locate your chat you can just go

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,340
ahead in there and just drop us a hello

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,619
say hi whatever um it's up to you if you

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,779
want to participate

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,519
um so it's my great pleasure to

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,699
introduce our speaker today Dr Christine

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,098
task is a serious Alum who earned her

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,480
PhD in computer science in 2015. current

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,660
she currently she is the senior computer

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,200
scientist at naxis research Corporation

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,180
her research focuses on privacy

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,600
technology and AI algorithms so this is

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,480
uh Christine's second seminar talk and

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,539
we're proud to say that her first talk

23
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,340
which uh I'll put a link to that in the

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,739
chat is the number one most watched

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,160
video on our YouTube channel yeah so I

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,480
thought that was pretty awesome so I

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,459
looked it up today in our analytics and

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,220
by far your talk you know you've got a

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,439
really good lead over second place so

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,140
that that is really cool so Christine

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,299
we're so happy to have you today so go

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,260
ahead please take it away

33
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,580
but not ten thousand which I think is

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,799
about where it's sitting at so

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,939
um we're gonna be talking about data

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,799
privacy and the interactions between

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,500
data and privacy

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,619
um I mean this is the talk outline and

39
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,000
um I don't really need to pay attention

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,860
to the left hand side what we're going

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,500
to look at is

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,560
when we want to de-identify data

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
and de-identifying data means we have

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,060
some sensitive input data set we're

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
looking at tabular data so survey data

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,380
like Census Data Veterans Administration

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,200
data Transportation data we're looking

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,060
at data where we have demographic

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,979
features and other information

50
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,619
and what we want to do is release that

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,000
data to the public

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,220
in some form that the public can use it

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,619
for analysis and learn things from it as

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,200
these agencies like to release data for

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,180
transparency sake but it's very

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,680
important that you are not able to

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,959
re-identify any individual in the data

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,420
so we need to anonymize it

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,920
um and I'm going to assume that with

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
this audience I don't need to make the

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,580
case that anonymizing is more complex

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,860
than just taking people's names off it

63
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,500
right so there's a lot of things you can

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,480
do to re-identify when you go to

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,040
de-identify you have to do something

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
significant to protect against that

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,300
hmm

68
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,120
purposes for de-identified microdata so

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
it can be used for analysis it can be

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
used to test code education all sorts of

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,459
things

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,440
um what does it really mean it really

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,900
means that we're going to take data on

74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,640
people in complex diverse communities

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,459
around the country around the world and

76
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,140
that data is going to live in some high

77
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,660
dimensional data space

78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,319
um

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
depicted in the lower right hand corner

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,239
there and what we want to do is make new

81
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,720
data that makes the same shapes as the

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,819
original data but does it with different

83
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,200
people

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,420
okay

85
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,800
how do we do that well that's

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,140
interesting so how do we preserve the

87
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,640
data distribution

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,739
oh and preserve it accurately and

89
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,420
authentically and with good equity for

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,940
everybody involved while protecting the

91
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
individuals in the data set so I'm going

92
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,659
to look at two very simple techniques to

93
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,920
begin with

94
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,080
um one is cell suppression cell

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,879
suppression is super easy

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
um it's not really even necessarily a

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,720
form of

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,540
um it's used to satisfy K anonymity and

99
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,120
what it does is if a count is too small

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
but okay so if there's fewer than 10

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,239
people or 10 or fewer people

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,720
um in some cell count in a table then

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,360
you redact those people so that means if

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,159
the count is too small for some type of

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,900
person you just get rid of them

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
for differentially private histogram

107
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,879
um well you do instead of protecting

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,400
anybody is you add randomized noise to

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,220
all the counts so for cell suppression

110
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,659
um if account's big you don't touch it

111
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,418
if account's small you get rid of it for

112
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,160
differential privacy

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,238
um

114
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
and that's a little bit of an

115
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,419
oversimplification of cell suppression

116
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,639
but bear with me

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,340
um DP histogram you add randomized noise

118
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,440
to the counts in order to provide a

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
provable guarantee of differential

120
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,280
privacy

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,139
um so here's the first audience question

122
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,419
for anybody in chat uh how many people

123
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,360
are familiar with differential privacy

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,919
don't have to be an expert how many

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,758
people have seen it before

126
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,000
possibly no one so here's what you

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
should do if you haven't seen

128
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,880
differential privacy

129
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,759
um this is a uh

130
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,360
a decade ago about exactly a decade ago

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,100
actually I gave a talk it's serious I

132
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,440
was in grad school at Purdue at the time

133
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,180
um Chris Clifton's my advisor and he

134
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,040
recommended I do this

135
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,979
um and what I did was it went over uh

136
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,979
just the basics of differential privacy

137
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,780
um why we're adding noise to those

138
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,880
counts what it gets us

139
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,840
um the basic takeaway idea is this I

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
want to be able to make it impossible

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
for somebody to guess whether you were

142
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,479
in the data or not

143
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,039
um and so what I'm going to look at is

144
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,360
what would the data look like if you

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,039
were in it what would the data look like

146
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,960
if you weren't in it

147
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,000
um you know maybe this is the world

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
where Uber in the data and over here is

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
what the data looks like if you're not

150
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,759
in the data and then what I'm going to

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,039
do is when I add noise

152
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,020
um all of a sudden rather than releasing

153
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,360
the exact answer there's sort of a range

154
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,880
of possible answers that I can release

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
and that range of possible answers

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
overlaps with the range of possible

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,320
answers a few words in the data and so

158
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,300
what that means is that when I release

159
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
that answer that noisy answer no

160
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,820
attacker can really tell if you were in

161
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,500
the data I was looking at this possible

162
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,080
world or if you weren't in the data and

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,880
I was looking at this possible world

164
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,860
and this goes through

165
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,620
um all the math and

166
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,060
um the proof and everything is actually

167
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,520
fairly straightforwards for the rest of

168
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,840
this talk you don't need to worry about

169
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,979
that just trust me that I can probably

170
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,199
protect your presence in the data by

171
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,500
adding a certain correctly you know

172
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,060
correct amount of noise correctly

173
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,680
calibrated amount of noise to every

174
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,900
count in the data

175
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,539
this was a great slide from that talk

176
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,300
I was very enthusiastic uh graduate

177
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,660
student and I said um it's really easy

178
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,639
to do differential privacy for counts

179
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,800
and the reason why is because when I

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
have a count of people count of types of

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,580
people or account of people with a

182
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,800
certain property I know how much that

183
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
count changes if I add or remove

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,500
somebody

185
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,419
it's a count of six people I had to

186
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,639
remove somebody it's gonna go to five or

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,039
it's going to go to seven and so it

188
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,780
makes differential privacy that old math

189
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,400
thing very easy to do and there's a

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
whole batch of papers and a whole lot of

191
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,120
work uh talking about counts

192
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,460
differential privacy

193
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,160
um

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,900
which brings us to this talk so

195
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,199
graduated Purdue uh came out to DC and a

196
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,180
few years later I was

197
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,680
um that talk turned out to be quite

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
useful we got a lot of views um by

199
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,740
people who were you know becoming

200
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,479
introduced to the field

201
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,539
a few years later and uh my company and

202
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,520
me specifically we were helping out with

203
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,560
differential privacy for the 2020 census

204
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,880
we were running the first national

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,620
challenge in differential privacy for

206
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,819
nist

207
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,740
um later on we were developing synthetic

208
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,319
Data Solutions uh for the census and we

209
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,400
were

210
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,740
um we were developing synthetic data

211
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,960
benchmarking tools for nest in addition

212
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
to other differential privacy and

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,860
synthetic data things it's reasonable

214
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,319
use of 10 years

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,960
but what that meant is going from the

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
academic papers I talked about how easy

217
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,819
it is to provide privacy

218
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,740
um to the reality of making sure that we

219
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,199
produce a product that performs well and

220
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,780
does Justice and preserves the data for

221
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,340
all of the various communities in that

222
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,240
data

223
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
so now we have the second part of the

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,800
problem we can privatize counts what are

225
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
we Counting

226
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,580
so we're going to go through

227
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,120
um

228
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,360
some properties in um

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,039
we're gonna go through some basic

230
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,139
properties of data distributions and

231
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,360
this is really important so this is

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
coming from the survey Community

233
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,000
um say relatively it's not comprehensive

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
um but these are just some basic things

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
that if you were working in privacy on

236
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,459
data it doesn't matter if you were if

237
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,440
you were doing anything that may be

238
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,360
impacted by the distribution of the data

239
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,820
so not just de-identification Federated

240
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,760
learning cryptographic protocols or

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,019
variety of things

242
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,880
these are some things to pay attention

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,620
to

244
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,519
um

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,800
consistency strength constraints so

246
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,959
consistency constraints are publicly

247
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,360
known logical rules that Define empty

248
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,459
spaces in the data space

249
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,040
so the data contains kindergartners and

250
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,540
divorces

251
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,220
but the de-identified data shouldn't

252
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
contain divorced kindergartners

253
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,000
but now we come to the the first

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,140
question for the chat we'll see if

255
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,940
anybody takes me up on this

256
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,380
but whether you type in the chat or

257
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,240
whether you just think it I want you to

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
think remember cell suppression redacts

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,740
small counts differential privacy adds

260
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,959
random noise to counts

261
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,580
which one do you think is going to have

262
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,800
a problem with consistency check

263
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
consistency constraints which one is

264
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
going to produce divorced

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,660
kindergarteners

266
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
so it's not cell suppressed data right

267
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,440
it's going to be the noise it's not cell

268
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,180
suppressed data cell suppressed data is

269
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,060
going to redact those small counts we're

270
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,100
going to lose some information but it

271
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,459
doesn't change any zeros I think zeros

272
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,260
are left unchanged big counts are left

273
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,660
unchanged cell suppression does fine

274
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,519
with these

275
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,440
differentially private histogram though

276
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,300
for a simple differentially private

277
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,680
histogram

278
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,660
has to add noise to be able to protect

279
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,160
the Privacy whether you remove somebody

280
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,279
or whether you add somebody right it has

281
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,800
to to privatize all of the possible

282
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
counts and if nobody tells it that the

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,420
things in the blue box are impossible

284
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,940
counts the naive histogram algorithm

285
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,360
will generate people there too

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,700
okay

287
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,080
um next up

288
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,899
feature sizes so feature is a variable

289
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,560
here if I have a say 200 records and a

290
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,380
feature with only four possible values

291
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,700
then most of the counts are likely to be

292
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,680
fairly large right

293
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,899
how is cell suppression going to respond

294
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,420
to large counts we just did this but I

295
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,320
don't want you to think about what

296
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,260
feature size does

297
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,360
the counts are large

298
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,160
um it's fine it doesn't change the data

299
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,899
at all doesn't redact it

300
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,240
not only that differential privacy is

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,260
also fine so for formal privacy

302
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,700
um it's adding what we're going to say

303
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,620
is relatively small amounts of noise

304
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,060
that means the amount of noise that I

305
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,339
add which is constant it only depends on

306
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,540
the fact that I'm counting it doesn't

307
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,540
depend on how many people I'm counting

308
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,279
um so that little bit of noise on top of

309
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,560
a big count means that the new count

310
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,180
you're going to get is pretty close to

311
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,160
your original count the ratio between

312
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,980
them is pretty close to one

313
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,060
um

314
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,640
so differential privacy does well on big

315
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,160
counts self-suppression does fine on big

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
counts

317
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,140
what if I have a high cardinality

318
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,399
variable

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,260
so now all of a sudden I have a lot of

320
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,720
possible values for those features and

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,060
that means relatively few people in

322
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,279
every Bend people are spread out across

323
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
all that

324
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
so

325
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
question of the audience

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
who's going to suffer the worse

327
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,160
here we see cell suppressions going to

328
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,760
erase some big portion of our data

329
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,339
differential privacy does better

330
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,200
but notice here that the the noise now

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,420
because it's the same constant additive

332
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,880
amount of noise the ratio between the

333
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,920
size the noise and the size the data as

334
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,019
the size of the data gets smaller

335
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,820
that that's getting a little bit closer

336
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,860
so now the impact is going to be bigger

337
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,860
relatively on these counts

338
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,640
um

339
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,560
but of course

340
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,060
it's still doing better than sound

341
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,500
suppression which is redacting most of

342
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,959
the data so the same algorithm that

343
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,260
performed well on

344
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,660
this feature

345
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,579
for that amount of people performs much

346
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,980
worse on this feature for that amount of

347
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,420
people so as you're going along adding

348
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,920
features to your schema you kind of have

349
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,899
to keep track of how big are those

350
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,160
features

351
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,279
how sparse is my data

352
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,040
um but it gets better all right so now

353
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,600
let's look at I talked about Equity a

354
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
couple times what I mean by that is that

355
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,339
in the data there's more than one group

356
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,440
in the data

357
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
um there's different there's different

358
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,839
groups of people different

359
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,880
subpopulations and those sub populations

360
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,220
may have different distributions and

361
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,959
what you want to do is be able to

362
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,779
preserve not only the whole sort of

363
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,040
aggregate majority population

364
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
distribution but in as long as they're

365
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,260
not too small you want to be able to do

366
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,820
a good job of preserving all of the

367
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,860
smaller groups as well even if their

368
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,540
data looks fairly different from the

369
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,279
major group

370
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,540
um so here we can see we've got uh white

371
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,760
men Asian men and it's just a much

372
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,399
smaller sample in this data of Asian men

373
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,060
than white men

374
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,339
that means it's some suppression there's

375
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,220
a point where the data is small enough

376
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,720
that cell suppression will just erase

377
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,459
people and you'll actually lose a whole

378
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,519
sub-population uh in fact this was this

379
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,139
was kind of a serious problem with

380
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,180
minority populations in rural areas in

381
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,920
the covet data

382
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,139
um because big swaths of the the data

383
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,240
was redacted but only for certain

384
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,060
demographic subgroups

385
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,260
same thing that we've seen with the

386
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,579
histogram it's going to do a little bit

387
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,339
better with this data but it is

388
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,839
still relatively worse utility than with

389
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,540
the larger majority population we're

390
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,040
able to preserve it we're not rejecting

391
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,720
them we're not erasing them but the

392
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,060
noise has more of an impact

393
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,339
um in fact you can see here you know

394
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,079
never married is twice as much as

395
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,839
divorced but here it's just a six and a

396
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,579
three only three people I really

397
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,380
shouldn't be preserving that data for

398
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,420
for privacy's sake in fact actually

399
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,639
after I add noise

400
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,500
um now that that difference has been

401
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,760
erased

402
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,680
because if we're exactly matching people

403
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,760
all of a sudden we're not really

404
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,220
providing privacy

405
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,720
um okay so that's something to be aware

406
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,380
of

407
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,480
subgroup sizes

408
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,860
um but it gets more interesting okay

409
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,680
this is the first fancy one so feature

410
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,240
correlations

411
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,560
um if two features are tightly

412
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,839
correlated with each other then some

413
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,220
combinations of those features will

414
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,779
occur rarely While others in

415
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,420
combinations will occur frequently this

416
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,920
will tend to result in larger counts

417
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,800
even with smaller group sizes so here 30

418
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,920
people or thereabouts we couldn't do um

419
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,500
we had troubles preserving that

420
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,519
um

421
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,699
over here with a small number of people

422
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm able to preserve it but it's because

423
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,260
none of my children have been married

424
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,199
um and that there is a much more likely

425
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,620
for my um extreme older Folk to have

426
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,000
been widowed

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,959
um

428
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,199
so here we see a tight correlation

429
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,100
and both algorithms perform this is this

430
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,260
is interesting pay attention to this

431
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,839
both algorithms perform the way you want

432
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,880
them to in your head when this is the

433
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,839
case

434
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,560
which is to say there is clear majority

435
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,380
population and clear outlier

436
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,360
and when

437
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,880
we redact groups

438
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,199
um

439
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,940
that means we are redacting only the

440
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,440
outliers

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,019
and we are tending to preserve the

442
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,399
majority for both cases

443
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,899
so a lot of times when you just have a

444
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,820
mental model of what the data looks like

445
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,100
when you're thinking about these sorts

446
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,959
of partition-based privacy things these

447
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,820
histogram-based privacy or you know

448
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,060
table based privacy what you're thinking

449
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,000
is that there's going to be some groups

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,620
some variables that are very correlated

451
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,880
and some

452
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,779
um

453
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,339
some bins are going to be very full of

454
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,420
people some bins are going to be very

455
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,680
empty and that's what you're trying to

456
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,300
preserve

457
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,560
but that doesn't necessarily happen

458
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,540
you're not guaranteed that

459
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,940
so now if I pick something new that is

460
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,699
not at all correlated with age

461
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,199
um and I have

462
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,300
favorite ice cream flavor

463
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,160
and it turns out people of all ages love

464
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,740
all ice cream flavors

465
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,120
but now that's

466
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
a type of disaster for our cell

467
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,800
suppression right there goes the whole

468
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,940
data

469
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,639
so same number of people but now they

470
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,440
are distributed

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,279
um

472
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,079
now because we're looking at the

473
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,339
combination of features that are

474
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,500
independent of each other all of a

475
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,780
sudden our counts are smaller and the

476
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,699
impact of privacy on utility is much

477
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,439
greater

478
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,699
um

479
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,380
that's because combining these two

480
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,720
independent features in the same data

481
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,919
spreading them out to many smaller

482
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,780
counts and the people were redacting

483
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,599
here they're not outliers it's not rare

484
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,020
or strange for a 10 year old like

485
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,820
chocolate ice cream the same way it is

486
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,880
for a 10 year old to be widowed

487
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,640
um this is just

488
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,860
what happens when we have a small data

489
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,539
and we're collecting over independent

490
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,100
feature combinations

491
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,600
of course this differentially private

492
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,220
histogram same thing as always right

493
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,960
smaller counts

494
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
um bigger relative noise it's doing

495
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
better than cell suppression

496
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,820
okay so now we get to the fun part

497
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,460
you might say from the previous that if

498
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,580
what we're trying to do is understand a

499
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,220
data distribution

500
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,960
um maybe we want to focus on features

501
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,360
that are correlated with each other and

502
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,280
not focus on features that are not

503
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,539
correlated with each other and that will

504
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,799
tend to preserve big counts that will

505
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,059
tend to make things run the way we think

506
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,820
they're going to run and it'll be fine

507
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,600
um but it turns out and I've got a

508
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,679
chocolate-based example but we see this

509
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,539
in real data I'm going to show you here

510
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,039
in a moment

511
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
um there's no reason why you can't have

512
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
two subgroups in the population with

513
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,120
different feature correlations so that

514
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,580
the same feature

515
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,280
um is independent for one group and

516
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,740
dependent for another group

517
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,900
and even though Bakers and chocolatiers

518
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,340
here started with the same population

519
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,580
size they both have 30.

520
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,799
um because this feature is independent

521
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,900
for them and correlated for the

522
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,059
chocolatiers what will happen is cell

523
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,640
suppression will erase the Bakers

524
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
and preserve the chocolatiers which is

525
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
really not what you're expecting to have

526
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,380
happen when you do privacy

527
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,419
same thing happens again

528
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:04,080
um

529
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,840
less relative noise for the correlated

530
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,960
data more relative noise for the smaller

531
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,400
data the independent data on

532
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,980
differential privacy

533
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,380
okay

534
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,480
so I promised real data

535
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,419
but this was a uh an overview of things

536
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,200
to think about right so that was

537
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,179
we have correlation patterns and the

538
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,559
fact that they're different right we're

539
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,600
trying to avoid small counts that means

540
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,220
we want correlated patterns but we want

541
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,020
them we have this problem they're

542
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,400
different for different subgroups so

543
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,720
we're putting ourselves into a corner

544
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,799
here

545
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,440
um we're also aware that

546
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,360
there's small groups and they're harder

547
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
to preserve

548
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,020
um through privacy but we want to try to

549
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,520
preserve them if we can

550
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,799
we know that just casually using these

551
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,020
high granularity uh informations these

552
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,539
variables with high cardinality makes

553
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,240
things much more challenging

554
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,780
um

555
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,760
small features work more like what we

556
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,559
think you know these techniques should

557
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,419
work and we know the consistency

558
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,940
strength constraints exist and different

559
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,440
approaches may or may not be aware of

560
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
them

561
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
and I made up all of this data

562
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,840
up this morning

563
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,059
so let's look at real data

564
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,559
um

565
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,780
and here we go

566
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,640
I've made a promise here

567
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Google SD nest

568
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,900
let's Google SD Nest you can try this at

569
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,280
home

570
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,559
that's synthetic data nest

571
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,980
okay synthetic data report tool GitHub

572
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,900
right there

573
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,600
okay nist diverse communities data

574
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,139
excerpts

575
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,580
so what this is

576
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,940
um sdnis that's all you have to do this

577
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,440
is a set of data excerpts which have

578
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,620
been chosen specifically to help

579
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,059
algorithm developers understand how

580
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,760
their algorithms perform on diverse data

581
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,640
so remember we said monolithic big

582
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,340
majority communities that are really

583
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,260
simple it's easy to get things to work

584
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,260
well but real people

585
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,280
um have much more real data have much

586
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,140
more diverse distributions where you may

587
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,480
see a lot of these problems arise like

588
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
the ones that I uh described so it's

589
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
just a small set of features we'll take

590
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,780
a look at them but I'll show you this

591
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,340
real quick first

592
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,820
Samina loads up here we go

593
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,960
um

594
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,419
these are chosen from communities all

595
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,159
over the country

596
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:35,880
um

597
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,860
that say relatively small feature set

598
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,780
drawn from the American Community survey

599
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,100
we'll show you the features in a moment

600
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,080
but these are all sorts of different

601
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,000
types of groups of people

602
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,100
and I expect hope you will believe me

603
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,919
now if I say different types of groups

604
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
of people make different shapes in the

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,659
data as far as which bin counts end up

606
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,100
being big

607
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,080
um how features end up being related or

608
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,640
independent from each other and

609
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,260
different shapes get different

610
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,600
performance

611
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
uh we have this relatively smaller

612
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
feature sense

613
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,700
um and actually today we're just going

614
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,500
to focus on even a smaller set just

615
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,960
eight of them but these again have been

616
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,400
chosen because they've got interesting

617
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,780
relationships between them so we have

618
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,120
disability features we have income

619
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,360
education we found the income decile for

620
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,679
you so you don't have to think too hard

621
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,260
if you want to use a um a decile for the

622
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,900
income instead of the the full number

623
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,320
um race things about family size whether

624
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,700
you're in a housing unit or group

625
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,039
quarters group quarters include things

626
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,039
like barracks and nursing homes and

627
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,520
dorms whether you own or you rent things

628
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,520
like this okay

629
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,039
um so

630
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,679
now we're working on real data and this

631
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,539
is what the real numbers look like this

632
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,179
is on the the national data set and here

633
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,200
we have

634
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,740
um five little age bins bin counts cell

635
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,880
suppression isn't changed anything

636
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,620
differential privacy isn't changed

637
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,179
anything by much

638
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,679
and what we're going to see is what

639
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,360
happens because

640
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,059
nobody releases a table like this no

641
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,740
nobody who's were I mean probably they

642
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,480
do some places but actually they do but

643
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,760
for the most part what we're interested

644
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,620
in is releasing data that has a larger

645
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,059
number of features we want we want to

646
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,700
release what's called microdata

647
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,120
um which is to say I've got data with

648
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,200
the American Community survey has uh 150

649
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,600
features 200 features

650
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,039
um the the stuff that we've shown you is

651
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,539
20 right now we're just going to look at

652
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,720
eight

653
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,159
here I have two features

654
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
and you guys should all see how this is

655
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,700
going now that I've added more

656
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,159
combinations I have a larger space my

657
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,600
accounts are getting smaller cell

658
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,520
suppression is starting to redact stuff

659
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,460
the histogram differential privacy this

660
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,380
is the actual differential privacy

661
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,980
um those counts are closer for the the

662
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,600
larger counts you get down to the

663
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,480
smaller counts now and maybe they change

664
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,280
a little bit more

665
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,419
um

666
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,679
it's not to say that it's actually

667
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,179
adding more noise it's just that the

668
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,340
size of the noise being added is

669
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,559
larger relative to the size of the

670
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,020
actual count so three is larger than two

671
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,799
as compared to 987 to 986.

672
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,418
um we had another feature

673
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,120
and so we go there's 413 different

674
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,100
record types this at this point is a

675
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,220
histogram with 413 bins and cell

676
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,500
suppression is redacting most of them

677
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,659
um

678
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:39,179
576 record types here we are at the end

679
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,760
and cell suppression this is a

680
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,980
proportional sample that's a because I

681
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,919
can't fit 576 things on a slide but this

682
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,559
is a proportional excerpt of the the

683
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,200
actual table and um you can see cell

684
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,940
suppression is

685
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,220
redacting the vast majority of it

686
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,260
differential privacy here we've grayed

687
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,760
things out when the counts have gotten

688
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,260
just very different from what the

689
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,419
original count was more than two times

690
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,280
off

691
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,980
um okay

692
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,919
and here's the important thing

693
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,620
um my date is still fine

694
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,720
but I don't know to what extent for the

695
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,520
folks watching this their data may or

696
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,780
may not be fine

697
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,200
so big majority counts in that

698
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
population

699
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,419
um are are still even with all of these

700
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,460
uh things that I've added they're still

701
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,320
coming out fairly large they're still

702
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,760
getting fairly good performance that

703
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,679
means if I'm doing the identification

704
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,120
and I only check for aggregate

705
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,679
performance if I'm only looking for

706
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,360
these big groups

707
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,960
um

708
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,120
then maybe I think it's going maybe I

709
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,539
believe it's fine but realistically

710
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,179
it's not fine because all of these

711
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,559
people up here they're not really

712
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,059
outliers they weren't outliers

713
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,559
you know six variables ago

714
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
they're only outliers now

715
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,860
um because of the way we're collecting

716
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,360
this information because the way we're

717
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,320
insisting on collecting the full uh

718
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,120
Cartesian product their vision and their

719
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,400
veterans uh disability and whether they

720
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,900
rent their own and whether they're in a

721
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
group quarters and whether they are

722
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,500
married and you know all of these things

723
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
together is what's making

724
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,779
um all of these counts so small for such

725
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,279
a large portion of the population so

726
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,799
what do we do to fix that

727
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,240
well

728
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,220
synthetic data

729
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,440
um so in my spare time

730
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,059
um I was a co-lead on the unece

731
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:36,659
um

732
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,400
synthetic data Guide for National

733
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,919
statistical organizations and I helped

734
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,320
them I co-led the synthetic data test

735
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,179
drive that they did

736
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,159
and here we go to Google again

737
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,940
synthetic data these are all looking at

738
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,020
fancier algorithms for making

739
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,480
de-identified data and they're not going

740
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,980
to be table based instead they're going

741
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,900
to use models to produce data that

742
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,059
preserves the distribution

743
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,380
um and that is going to allow them to

744
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,880
escape those problems that we saw but

745
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,260
the tables maybe

746
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,659
last thing I asked you to to type in was

747
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,460
uh SD nist

748
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,039
this one real simple synthetic data test

749
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,480
drive

750
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,400
so what we did and here it is they're

751
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,179
hlg Moss synthetic data test drive

752
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,100
uh is we took

753
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,320
it was this fantastic thing they they

754
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,700
gathered together

755
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,520
um data users data owners from all over

756
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,559
the world statistical agencies all over

757
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,080
the world and all the time zones

758
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,539
um and for one week we provided them

759
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,900
with guidance on how to go use their own

760
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,100
provide them some data and some guidance

761
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,220
on how to do synthetic data

762
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,200
um and some algorithms and things online

763
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,240
where they could access synthetic data

764
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,279
and then we asked them to generate as

765
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,760
many synthetic data sets from as many

766
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
different synthetic data techniques as

767
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,360
they could

768
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
and then evaluate those

769
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
however they saw fit

770
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,820
so what this means is we got

771
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,799
from all of these agencies from all of

772
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,480
these statisticians with decades and

773
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,299
Decades of experience both with the

774
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,980
academic and research side of statistics

775
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,080
and specifically with this type of data

776
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,600
that we want to understand better

777
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,140
um

778
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,039
they

779
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,620
wins and used a variety of synthesis

780
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,720
techniques which we have archived here

781
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,880
you've got the name the type uh license

782
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,279
documents which teams used it

783
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,059
um

784
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,760
and then we also have

785
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,000
um utility metrics so these people who

786
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,520
are experts in data not

787
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,159
what I do what maybe the Privacy

788
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,539
Community thinks about when they think

789
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,000
about utility for data but what the

790
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,860
statistical agencies think about when

791
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,539
they think about utility date for data

792
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,020
with two data and by utility here I mean

793
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,279
that the synthetic data the

794
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,840
de-identified data should maintain the

795
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,539
distribution of the original data

796
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,760
um so how do you compare those so here

797
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,279
we have all of their utility methods um

798
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,799
univariate distributions

799
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,400
um

800
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,940
Divergence tests propensity metrics

801
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,000
um classifier performance and other

802
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,919
methods

803
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,020
okay

804
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,279
so

805
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,159
if you want to know about synthetic data

806
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,140
this is a good place to look but there's

807
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,000
a lot more over here you can look at

808
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
videos that they made you can look at

809
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,200
the synthetic data Guide that came from

810
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,419
unece

811
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,580
you can look at the the quick start

812
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,260
guide that we helped these folks get

813
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,820
started in synthetic data so if you want

814
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,559
to get started in synthetic data and

815
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,000
click that right there

816
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,380
and uh cool all right

817
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,240
um

818
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,679
so

819
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,720
that was a good way to go find what's

820
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,000
out there what people are using in terms

821
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,559
of uh dated the identification

822
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,020
techniques for synthetic data

823
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm going to pause here

824
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,299
um are there any questions somebody let

825
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,100
me know and does it make sense when I

826
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,140
say synthetic data so what we're doing

827
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,059
is we're taking

828
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,340
um the real data and rather than doing a

829
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,899
table and trying to change the counts on

830
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,399
the table

831
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,360
um what we're going to do is take the

832
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,740
data and we're going to feed it into

833
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,419
some model and we're looking at three

834
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,039
different possibilities here for that

835
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,760
bottle

836
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,320
and that model is going to then produce

837
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,419
a new data set that should hopefully be

838
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,799
in the same distribution as the original

839
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,600
data and what that means is that

840
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,279
analyzes that you want in the new data

841
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,919
set are going to you know run the same

842
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,380
ideally as long as a population level

843
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,480
analysis as they would on the original

844
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,980
data

845
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,640
um

846
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,679
well the new data should not contain any

847
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,080
real people

848
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,700
do people are familiar with synthetic

849
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,220
data so at least one person can be the

850
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,659
brave person let me know and chat have

851
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,919
you guys heard of synthetic Data before

852
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,779
awesome okay

853
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,960
um and thank you Chris for that question

854
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,059
so uh yes we we will actually I'll show

855
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,919
off some really neat tools um that I

856
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,179
haven't had a chance to show you yet

857
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,500
Chris

858
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,179
um about

859
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,620
whether or not there's going to be real

860
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,539
people in the synthetic day so that is a

861
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,740
risk

862
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,779
um you want to make sure that when

863
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,460
you're feeding the data into the model

864
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,620
and the model spitting out the new data

865
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,419
that the new data doesn't include real

866
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,779
people in it that can be re-identified

867
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,779
um

868
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:38,460
and good to know but I think nobody's

869
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,720
using the questions at the moment

870
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,360
everybody's using the chat so

871
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,860
okay

872
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,918
um

873
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,120
coming back to this

874
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,820
here are three methods uh decision trees

875
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,919
current models

876
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,380
um cans General generative adversarial

877
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,480
networks and differentially private

878
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,220
probabilistographical models so these

879
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,419
two appear they're not differentially

880
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,279
private this one is differentially

881
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,539
private what comes with that nice

882
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,460
guarantee

883
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,600
um

884
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,320
okay

885
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,580
uh okay so we get up to I see chadstone

886
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,559
people in chat don't see other people in

887
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,720
chat so we hope to fix that um that's

888
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,600
okay I will go ahead and uh announce to

889
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
chat when we're seeing things

890
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,620
um

891
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,279
I will announce chat to chat

892
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,380
looking at our first model

893
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,980
so this is uh decision tree curb model

894
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,000
um and actually if you follow the

895
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,520
directions up on the the test drive

896
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,899
um the quick start directions to write

897
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,820
your own synthetic data set it's going

898
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,260
to show you how to do it with a cart

899
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,940
model

900
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,159
um what this word is so if you're

901
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,080
familiar with decision trees

902
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,100
um

903
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,679
they're just a straight way of a simple

904
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,960
way of making it so that you can predict

905
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,000
the variable for a given you can predict

906
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,679
the value for a given variable you can

907
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,659
think of it like a flow chart

908
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,399
so basically what it's doing is it's

909
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,659
saying

910
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,820
um if you have this value for variable a

911
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,220
and this value for variable B then

912
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,539
you're going to have this value for

913
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,520
variable C

914
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,860
um the Wikipedia example has predicts

915
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,840
whether you survived or died on the

916
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,720
Potomac or on the Titanic it takes

917
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,039
whether you survived it died in the

918
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,899
Titanic depending on whether or not you

919
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,580
had siblings what age you were if you

920
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,960
were male or female

921
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,059
so what you can do is actually use a

922
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:28,679
decision tree to synthesize the value

923
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,299
for a single variable

924
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,640
and the way that works is I'm looking at

925
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
my Titanic example

926
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,779
um I would say I have this record and I

927
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,539
know it's age and it's sex and if it has

928
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,880
siblings and I'm going to work my way

929
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,440
down the tree and use that to come up

930
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,080
with a new value for did it survive or

931
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
did it die

932
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
um

933
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,340
now I have that new value for that

934
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,919
record and that gives me a synthetic

935
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,120
data which is

936
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,399
three quarters real data in one quarter

937
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,399
a new synthetic value but we can stack

938
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,480
these trees so if I have data with a lot

939
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,580
of variables in it what I can do is use

940
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,699
my real values for one and my A and B my

941
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,159
synthetic value for C and use that to

942
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,379
synthesize a new variable d

943
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,780
and then I can take A and B synthetic C

944
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,480
synthetic D and use that to synthesize e

945
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,580
and I can keep on going and that way I

946
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,040
can make new synthetic data that's

947
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
following that same sort of flow flow

948
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,119
chart variable correlations from the

949
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,159
original data and the nice thing about

950
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,760
this is the way the tree works when you

951
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,020
build this tree

952
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,940
she don't do my hand right this is a

953
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,520
machine learning data mining process

954
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,199
um what it's doing is it's building the

955
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,918
flow chart that hangs on to correlations

956
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,080
um between features and drops

957
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,940
independent ones right so it knows if

958
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,500
you're down this side of the tree if

959
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,540
you're in this part of the population

960
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,859
then this is the information we need to

961
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,780
make the prediction whereas if you're on

962
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,699
this other side of the tree then maybe

963
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,380
it's this information that you need to

964
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,580
make the prediction

965
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,859
and so that means we're less likely to

966
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,800
go capture those those Independents

967
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,480
um marginals that were like in the

968
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,800
independent table where we're having

969
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,980
problems that makes the data more sparse

970
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
um

971
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,619
okay

972
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,260
generalized adversarial Networks

973
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,760
so for that we're going to try in a deep

974
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,260
neural network to mimic the distribution

975
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,420
of the input data and then use that

976
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,980
Network to produce new data set that

977
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,119
should keep the feature correlations

978
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,760
from the original data so this is um

979
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,800
just in the past few years here we've

980
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,540
seen this do crazy very impressive

981
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,400
things with images and text

982
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,859
it turns out it struggles a little bit

983
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,839
more with time to go data we're going to

984
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,579
look at two possibilities coming from

985
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,160
the SD volt library and both of these if

986
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,060
you want to check them out they're

987
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,520
linked from that test drive page

988
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
uh the first one is just the default

989
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,540
setting runs in a few minutes second one

990
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,780
is the compil again and that's um uses

991
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,980
sort of a different way of processing

992
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,140
the the data beforehand and it's

993
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,839
supposed to work better on tabular data

994
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,619
um

995
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,900
and so we'll also we'll show you both of

996
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,640
those

997
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,079
um and neither of those so neither of

998
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,300
these are formerly private so far this

999
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,800
one is though our third one is

1000
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
probabilistic graphical matter model

1001
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,859
um

1002
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,560
Alex which person doesn't exist

1003
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,320
all right

1004
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,359
um the the next thing is a

1005
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,099
differentially private probabilistic

1006
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,300
graphical model

1007
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,880
so the graphical model captures the

1008
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,440
relationships as conditional

1009
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,880
probabilities between features and I

1010
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,400
realize every single thing here is oh

1011
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,900
yeah this person does not exist yeah

1012
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,339
that's what the image is very cool thank

1013
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,440
you remember that now

1014
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,540
um so you can see how well Gans do on

1015
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,579
images

1016
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,380
and I hope that inspires you with lots

1017
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,300
of confidence I realize everything here

1018
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,520
is circles and lines but these circles

1019
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,960
and lines were flow chart this was a

1020
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,320
tree these here are neurons in the the

1021
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,880
neural network

1022
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,579
and these are whole features

1023
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,000
so this is saying if I have say sex and

1024
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
marital status and race and veteran

1025
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,500
disability

1026
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,180
um can I find which of these features

1027
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,859
are correlated with each other most

1028
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,540
correlated with each other

1029
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,280
and draw an edge between them that's

1030
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,420
going to capture their conditional

1031
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,099
probability distribution

1032
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,480
if they're not correlated with each

1033
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,740
other then I'm not going to draw that

1034
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,940
edge between them

1035
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,680
and of course in in general what's going

1036
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,660
to happen here is I'm capturing the

1037
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,000
majority populations

1038
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,460
um potentially the nice thing about this

1039
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,440
so now what happens is once I have these

1040
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
features and I have their conditional

1041
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,760
probability

1042
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,619
distributions I can walk through this

1043
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,140
Traverse this graph and use it to

1044
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,700
generate a synthetic record so I've got

1045
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,619
a value for a and then I know from that

1046
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,440
value of a I can pick what value of D is

1047
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,300
likely and I can pick what value of B is

1048
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,680
likely and then I can come over here and

1049
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,300
use that to pick what value of e is

1050
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,800
likely and so on all the way through

1051
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,900
that gets me a new record I keep doing

1052
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,240
that till I get a data set

1053
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,040
um these are great for differential

1054
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,099
privacy because uh this is the one where

1055
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,960
that optimistic slide at the beginning

1056
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,119
about let's all use counts we can just

1057
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,859
use counts for this

1058
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,300
um you can use marginal counts very

1059
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,520
simple uh relatively low sensitivity low

1060
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,839
noise

1061
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,760
um to get all of these correlations

1062
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,920
between these features

1063
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,660
um the fewer of them that you've got the

1064
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,460
less noise you have to add

1065
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,260
fewer queries you're doing and if you

1066
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,820
want to understand that check out the uh

1067
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,040
the differential privacy tutorial

1068
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,220
okay

1069
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,280
uh also real quick real quick

1070
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
um

1071
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,980
we're going to type in estinist again

1072
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,820
we're going to go down and click on SD

1073
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,220
nest and rather than going to this we're

1074
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,920
going to skin down and see the uh the

1075
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,560
readme here and what this is is a

1076
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,040
synthetic data report tool

1077
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,540
um because

1078
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,339
we would like you guys to use the um

1079
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,960
we would like you guys to use the

1080
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
utility Matrix metrics that we shared in

1081
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,599
the synthetic test drive

1082
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,740
but

1083
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,960
that's a lot of work like those

1084
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,700
definitions there's documentations but

1085
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,780
you don't want to have to code them up

1086
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,420
yourself so we've coded them up for you

1087
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,760
the main body of the SD nist library at

1088
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,900
the moment and you just follow the

1089
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,579
installation instructions please file an

1090
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,720
issue if it doesn't work but it should

1091
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,579
work pretty easy

1092
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,680
um is this report generator and this

1093
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,140
actually you runs on the diverse

1094
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,880
Community data

1095
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,099
um and you de-identify the data however

1096
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,780
you please do something to the data that

1097
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,060
me you and your heart makes it feel like

1098
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,619
the data is more private we don't care

1099
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,359
as long as the same scheme as original

1100
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,060
data give that to us send it into this

1101
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,760
system here and he'll go ahead and score

1102
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,420
your data on a whole batch of different

1103
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,079
metrics

1104
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,099
all of those things listed over at the

1105
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,599
test drive and I'm not going to go

1106
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,220
through them all right now

1107
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,599
um because there's finite time in the

1108
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,700
world we're focused on other things but

1109
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
there's a lot here to go explore if

1110
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,940
you're curious

1111
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,320
um the one that we're going to focus on

1112
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,740
is this one

1113
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,260
so

1114
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,599
this is the principal component metric

1115
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,579
and I like it because

1116
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,859
um I sort of gesture about blobs and the

1117
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,540
data wanting to be able to preserve the

1118
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,280
blobs and the data preserve the shape of

1119
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,500
the data the diverse shape of the data

1120
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,480
that did it and what am I talking about

1121
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,280
right I have eight features I'm in an

1122
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,680
eight-dimensional feature space

1123
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,680
um that's a strange thing to say when

1124
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,420
we're talking about eight dimensional or

1125
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,240
20 dimensional or 100 dimensional shapes

1126
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,280
especially when I want to think about

1127
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,900
shapes and geometry normally I'm

1128
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,420
thinking about numbers you know I can

1129
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,820
say this is the this is the end of the

1130
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,859
shape that is closer to zero this is the

1131
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,060
end of the shape that's farther from

1132
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,579
zero they're continuous between them but

1133
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,920
when I'm talking about this data we

1134
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,020
actually have categorical features in

1135
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,280
fact if you go to the full data set

1136
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,839
we've got things like field of degree

1137
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,119
wouldn't you major in what's your career

1138
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,040
in where you know what Puma what

1139
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,079
district do you live in

1140
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,680
um

1141
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,300
so what do I mean when we're talking

1142
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,619
about data and space well we don't

1143
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,540
entirely know

1144
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,099
um but what we have is this and it's

1145
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,660
really cool

1146
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,380
um

1147
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,900
principal components

1148
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,020
um is a linear algebra magic way of

1149
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,500
saying this axis through the data is

1150
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,540
interesting you see a lot of variation

1151
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,359
on this axis through the data and what

1152
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,000
happens is if I can draw two

1153
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,440
um

1154
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,220
two normal axes for the data uh then I

1155
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,079
can do like a Cartesian plot I can do a

1156
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,400
scatter plot

1157
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,160
right so um

1158
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,260
I have here the first five principal

1159
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,720
components of my data set these are

1160
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,180
things that are interesting axes for the

1161
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,119
data and what I can do is pick two of

1162
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:51,900
them

1163
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,940
and then plot the data with respect to

1164
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,500
those two axes

1165
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,900
so here though the first one is housing

1166
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,079
type and marital status and the second

1167
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,540
one is age and Veteran status

1168
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,339
so here we're looking at the scatter

1169
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:06,960
plot what the shapes in the data look

1170
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,240
like with respect to housing type

1171
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,700
marital status age and Veteran status

1172
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,260
and we can see you get a Big Blob here

1173
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,079
little blob here little blob here in

1174
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,300
fact what this lines up with and there's

1175
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,339
a lot I I there's going to be some very

1176
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,079
fancy tools released soon and I'll tell

1177
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,660
you how to define them but this Big Blob

1178
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,560
here

1179
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,839
that's everybody who's uh living in a

1180
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,540
housing unit this is for institutional

1181
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,619
group quarters and this is

1182
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,079
non-institutional group quarters

1183
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,460
um but you see here

1184
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,500
this de-identified data is not doing a

1185
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,480
good job of preserving the patterns in

1186
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,160
the real data

1187
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,560
so let's take a look

1188
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,540
okay

1189
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,400
here are our well we're not doing cell

1190
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,660
suppression we're just doing cart model

1191
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,540
again and DPP Jam so here's our three

1192
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,339
techniques

1193
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,180
um

1194
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,160
take just a moment

1195
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,079
and let me know in chat

1196
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,140
which one do you think is going to win

1197
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,880
Chris isn't allowed to answer everybody

1198
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,599
else can answer

1199
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,760
do I see people who uh who think the

1200
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,260
cart model is going to work so those

1201
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,200
decision trees that whole stack of trees

1202
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,280
um it's going to perform better it's

1203
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,380
going to do a good job of preserving uh

1204
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,480
those relationships or is it going to be

1205
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,240
the gam so the Gans that like Alex

1206
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,700
linked the uh the site for this person

1207
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,380
does not exist.com

1208
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,420
which is a very cool again application

1209
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,400
as he says you've seen all the neat Gan

1210
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,579
images and Text data very convincing

1211
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:33,480
um or is it going to be the

1212
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,440
differentially private

1213
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,599
probabilistographical model that's got

1214
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,460
this way of capturing the relationships

1215
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,200
between all the features kind of in one

1216
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,579
big graph

1217
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,060
anybody brave enough to guess okay

1218
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,540
one for DPP GM anybody else

1219
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,180
another one for DPP Jam good

1220
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,920
they did win the synthetic data

1221
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,880
challenge but it was a differentially

1222
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,280
private synthetic data challenge

1223
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,780
remember we have all of these things

1224
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,180
that may impact the results

1225
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,040
all right I'm so many everybody's

1226
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,480
thought about it now

1227
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,700
so let's take a look

1228
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,260
so as I said

1229
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,619
um first of all this is the um up here I

1230
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:11,940
think it's institutional group quarters

1231
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,560
this is non-institutional group quarters

1232
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,440
this chunk here turns out to be people

1233
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,660
who have uh

1234
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,920
um housing

1235
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,839
um there's also some correlation in here

1236
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,520
with whether you are housing units like

1237
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,099
apartments or houses or whatever

1238
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:26,700
um

1239
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,079
some correlation here with whether you

1240
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,359
enter your own this big streak right

1241
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:31,859
here the way the streaks kind of come

1242
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,480
out a lot of that has to do with age

1243
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,400
that's the age variable that's sort of

1244
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,560
drawing things out like that

1245
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,660
um you see over here is actually um some

1246
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,819
Vision issues

1247
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,280
um we'll see also along with age this uh

1248
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,040
layers that are marital status in here

1249
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,500
and um I'm just gesturing wildly I

1250
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,220
actually have a super awesome

1251
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,960
highlighting tool that's not quite ready

1252
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,700
but we'll be releasing it you can use it

1253
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,160
to find all this stuff for yourself

1254
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,839
um who will show some uh screenshots

1255
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:58,980
from it

1256
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,720
so

1257
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,599
let's start with the copy again

1258
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,380
um

1259
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,480
here we see that the copulogans kind of

1260
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,520
preserving these but it's got this blob

1261
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,040
right here

1262
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,380
and that blob is because the copulogland

1263
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,359
is not doing a good job of maintaining

1264
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,400
consistency constraints

1265
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,740
so this person here their housing type

1266
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,780
is group quarters so they're in a dorm

1267
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,540
for instance but also apparently they

1268
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,839
own that dorm which is very ambitious

1269
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,540
um they're also 58 in the dorm so this

1270
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,060
is uh this whole group right here in the

1271
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,200
middle

1272
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,819
um this is an artifact that's happening

1273
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,099
because the Gan has missed a consistency

1274
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,380
constraint

1275
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,480
um and in fact it's missed a few of them

1276
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,460
so here we can see

1277
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,740
um these are children less than 15 years

1278
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,359
old and that means that their marriage

1279
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,220
value is no we have no married

1280
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,319
kindergartners here

1281
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,640
um and so we see over here we've got you

1282
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,319
know these kids

1283
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,480
um some in dorms

1284
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,720
um some in juvie I think uh and here we

1285
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,859
have

1286
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,660
um you know at the younger age of this

1287
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,339
age distribution younger end of this age

1288
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,540
distribution

1289
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,940
and over here we actually have people of

1290
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,240
all ages who are showing up as the null

1291
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,300
less than 15 years

1292
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,859
um so it's failed to get that but

1293
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,780
remember the capital again was supposed

1294
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,780
to do better than the basic again uh

1295
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,760
this is the basic again and it just sort

1296
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,859
of it's just suffering

1297
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:29,460
um

1298
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,380
so I mean we could explore it but

1299
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,200
essentially uh kind of it's lost all

1300
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
structure and the data are most

1301
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,040
structure in the data

1302
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,760
um

1303
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,440
okay

1304
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,079
now let's look at Curb models

1305
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,540
so the curb model we see is actually it

1306
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,640
doesn't have that artifact

1307
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,780
um and in fact not only does it have

1308
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,819
that not have that artifact it's

1309
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:52,020
actually doing

1310
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,000
um so we can see here it's preserving

1311
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,099
very very nicely

1312
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,020
um even this fine-grained thing about

1313
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,020
age less than 15 years we can see you

1314
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,180
know there's a blush batch of smaller

1315
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,680
Dots here there's a bunch of smaller

1316
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,060
Dots here

1317
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,180
it's doing a very high uh High Fidelity

1318
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,280
job of preserving the relationships in

1319
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,800
the data both the ones that shouldn't

1320
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,839
exist and the ones that should

1321
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,579
that said

1322
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,380
we see two good utility we start to

1323
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,020
worry about privacy right this is not

1324
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,660
differentially private

1325
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,339
um so let's take a look at these little

1326
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,339
outliers here and what's true is it

1327
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:32,760
actually uh PCA uh sorry they

1328
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,980
um the curb model actually fairly very

1329
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,420
rarely in practice if there's a

1330
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,980
reasonable number of features remember

1331
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,599
they've got a Pachinko their way all the

1332
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,700
way through those trees they very rarely

1333
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,579
reproduce full real individuals

1334
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:45,839
um instead what they do is they sort of

1335
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,660
reproduce similar individuals but not

1336
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,640
the same and often they differ in very

1337
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,099
important ways so right here this group

1338
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,240
right here this is um two dots they are

1339
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,579
older gentlemen who've never been

1340
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,980
married they're black they're an

1341
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,099
Institutional group quarters and uh they

1342
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,760
have a very severe veteran disability

1343
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,980
and here this new person who's kind of

1344
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,660
in that same area so kind of preserving

1345
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,579
that part of the relationship also old

1346
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,760
but white and they were married but

1347
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,140
their spouse was absent now

1348
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,599
institutional group quarters

1349
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,339
um very disabled have problems with

1350
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:24,359
vision

1351
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,460
and so it's a similar sort of person

1352
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,260
taking up a similar sort of spot in the

1353
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,300
data but you wouldn't look at this

1354
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,280
necessarily and think oh I could

1355
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,920
identify this person over here that this

1356
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,020
white person who's been married is the

1357
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,079
same and is 68 is the same as this you

1358
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,880
know 70 year old who was black and has

1359
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,740
never been married

1360
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,760
um and that's the sort of differences

1361
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,480
you see for this

1362
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,200
I'm looking at DPP GM and I tried to for

1363
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,119
time and possibly I should have cut more

1364
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,460
for time but anyways I didn't go into

1365
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,940
numerical versus uh yeah oof but let me

1366
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,200
tell you why

1367
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,180
um I didn't go into numerical versus

1368
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,040
categorical data

1369
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,920
um but talked about a little bit so

1370
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,619
numerical data things like income things

1371
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,140
like age have many different possible

1372
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,760
values

1373
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,560
um so a whole range of things and the

1374
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,819
decision tree can do that pretty well

1375
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,319
because the decision Tree in some sense

1376
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:22,680
is just sort of reshuffling everything

1377
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,839
um but for the differential privacy we

1378
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,280
actually still underneath in the model

1379
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,660
it's still got to have counts of people

1380
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,099
and those counts of people still have to

1381
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,619
fall into categories and so it's much

1382
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:32,940
harder to do that with numerical

1383
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,099
variables they're very spread out and

1384
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,180
that's what we're seeing here actually

1385
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,680
is age

1386
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,720
um is having a lot of problems for the

1387
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,940
dppgm and we're also having problems

1388
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,760
with um of course the constraints way

1389
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,800
back at the beginning here we are

1390
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,359
generating people who fall into this um

1391
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,280
in that same section where it's not

1392
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,020
understanding the relationship between

1393
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,140
being in a group quarters and

1394
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,720
um and owning your house

1395
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,859
um

1396
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,380
okay and we can see also it's got some

1397
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,540
problems with children who shouldn't be

1398
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,720
married

1399
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,180
so here's the important thing though

1400
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,079
um

1401
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:15,599
consistency constraints can be added to

1402
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,800
differentially private algorithms

1403
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,540
because they're public there's no reason

1404
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,760
why you can't add them they can be done

1405
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,200
as post-processing so this could happen

1406
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,460
with all these techniques you could just

1407
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,020
eliminate anything that violates the

1408
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,300
consistency consistency constraint

1409
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,400
or the neat thing about differentially

1410
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,780
private algorithms is that if you

1411
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,400
include the consistency constraints as

1412
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,900
part of the neighborhood definition so

1413
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,099
you say when we're talking about this

1414
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,720
neighboring profitable worlds adding or

1415
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,300
subtracting somebody I say it's not

1416
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,099
possible to add somebody who violates a

1417
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,720
constraint

1418
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,819
um then that actually improves your

1419
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:47,579
results overall by basically reducing

1420
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,740
the number of cells in the table and the

1421
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,000
amount of noise you're adding overall

1422
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,839
and so this could probably be fixed

1423
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,940
all right one more

1424
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,900
um

1425
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,300
now we're going to look at two other

1426
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,099
components this is focused on

1427
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,140
demographic so this is the veteran

1428
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,460
disability uh and then race and sex are

1429
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,020
the things we see here and this is going

1430
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,819
to be veteran disability level up here

1431
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,619
it's a status it should say veteran

1432
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,260
disability status and down here these

1433
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,839
are people who are not veterans These

1434
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:20,220
Bars actually end up representing

1435
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,920
different Sexes and we've seen races as

1436
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,260
sort of layers throughout here

1437
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,880
um which again fancy tool that does all

1438
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,040
this highlighting to show all that but

1439
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,599
we're just getting a sort of shortcut

1440
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,579
here so we're looking at people who have

1441
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:34,859
extreme veteran disabilities and the

1442
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,359
ground truth data that's right up here

1443
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,380
these are the group that have Vision

1444
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,940
disabilities these are the people who

1445
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,260
don't

1446
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,400
um

1447
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,680
and let's go

1448
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,859
carp model does fine so same thing we've

1449
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,540
got the same basic clumps but if you

1450
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,800
look carefully you see they're being

1451
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,140
made out of different people

1452
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,420
but it's not from a privacy it's not

1453
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,579
guaranteed

1454
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:57,119
um

1455
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,819
Dan is fantastic so uh things have been

1456
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,119
very bad for the basic SD Vault given

1457
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,800
that these dots in red are the people

1458
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,280
who have um severe disability due to

1459
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,319
military service

1460
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,480
meanwhile over here in the couple again

1461
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,000
it's actually been much more peaceful

1462
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,619
um and somehow the copula again got

1463
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,380
nobody who was severely disabled due to

1464
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,880
veteran status

1465
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,800
in either case

1466
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,540
um this is where you get to the

1467
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,640
explainable AI things looking at how

1468
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,980
deep learning really works

1469
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,319
um it's trickier when we are talking

1470
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,300
about tabular data to understand these

1471
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,040
things then when you're talking about

1472
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,460
images or text so you know when an AI

1473
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,780
has generated some text that's

1474
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,400
ridiculous or silly you know when it's

1475
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,460
got an image that has some artifact some

1476
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,440
strangeness in it

1477
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,359
um and here what we're seeing is

1478
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,720
basically that same sort of strangeness

1479
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,579
but he doesn't it shows up only when

1480
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:57,540
we're getting to these sort of

1481
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,880
interesting complex bits of the

1482
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,200
distribution where we're looking at the

1483
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,700
relationships between these features

1484
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,180
here down in kind of the lower pcas

1485
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,579
um and as we get to understand more

1486
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,079
about how deep learning is working in

1487
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,420
general over the next decade

1488
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,079
um

1489
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:14,400
potentially will have better

1490
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
understanding of this but if you want to

1491
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,900
play with this and start understanding

1492
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,000
it now again we've got all the tools you

1493
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,440
need to play with it

1494
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,099
finally our friend dppgm and here it's

1495
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:27,780
doing just fine

1496
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,420
so there's no real edit constraint

1497
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,160
problems that it's going to run into on

1498
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,619
these features all combinations of

1499
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,680
Veteran status race and sex are valid uh

1500
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,380
there's no numerical data features so

1501
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,700
it's not having to fight with age or

1502
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,900
anything these are all categorical

1503
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,140
groups and we see for performance very

1504
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,240
similar to the curb model and and

1505
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,619
actually you know it's a little bit of

1506
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,540
artifacts here but really quite close to

1507
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,400
the ground truth

1508
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,819
um we're actually getting uh

1509
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:59,400
formal privacy right

1510
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,280
so the takeaway here

1511
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,980
is that there's a lot of things that can

1512
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,500
be if you understand if you consciously

1513
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,540
know what the pitfalls and the

1514
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,420
properties of the data are and what can

1515
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,839
happen in diverse and complex data

1516
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,460
um even in these sort of small cases

1517
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,900
here right

1518
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,220
um if you actually look at what's going

1519
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,200
on then you can potentially go in and

1520
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,819
fix these things so I know more about

1521
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:27,480
this technique than these I can say you

1522
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,800
know here's things they need to do to go

1523
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,020
improve their results which they can do

1524
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,220
straightforward so you can add

1525
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,619
constraints they can um and this is a

1526
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,480
prototype version this is uh Minuteman

1527
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,000
winner of uh one of the winners of the

1528
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,460
the niche challenges and

1529
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,119
um

1530
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,859
they have their the code up you can

1531
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,359
actually get to it from the sd-nist

1532
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,940
library and uh and then try it out

1533
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,160
yourself it's a prototype version I the

1534
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,400
group continues to refine that work

1535
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,500
um but we can see just sort of

1536
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,940
immediately those things that can be

1537
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,099
done you know for all of these to

1538
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,200
understand them better to see why

1539
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,300
they're doing what they're doing to

1540
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,740
figure out how to improve their results

1541
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,960
which is what we do next so

1542
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,460
um

1543
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,800
expected October 22 is a little bit

1544
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,540
ambitious I think the paperwork is still

1545
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,760
kind of crawling through nist but very

1546
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,800
soon we're going to be kicking off the

1547
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,900
collaborative research cycle

1548
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,839
um and this is

1549
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:27,799
time to Google

1550
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,260
collaborative

1551
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,940
research cycle

1552
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,020
scroll down a little bit this is the

1553
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,640
newer thing it doesn't have quite the

1554
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,380
SEO

1555
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,319
um so what this is

1556
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,260
its invitation for all of you anybody

1557
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,480
you know anybody who's interested to

1558
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,640
join us in doing the thing I just

1559
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,619
suggested playing with all the toys we

1560
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,839
just showed off right each of these tabs

1561
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,920
um

1562
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,440
playing with all the toys seeing what

1563
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,819
you can find

1564
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:09,599
and um and then working with us together

1565
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,260
discover how these things work so uh

1566
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,000
it's two steps the first one the

1567
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,800
exploratory Workshop all we're asking

1568
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,260
you to do is take

1569
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,119
um those data sets the the diverse

1570
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,220
Community data sets and do something to

1571
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,960
de-identify them whatever you feel like

1572
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,579
so just like I said as you do for the

1573
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,140
input for the evaluator

1574
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,480
take the data sets de-identify them

1575
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,640
somehow your favorite algorithm your

1576
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,720
friend's favorite algorithm something

1577
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,339
you got off the test drive website

1578
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:36,599
whatever

1579
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,760
send us the de-identified data along

1580
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,380
with like a little abstract that tells

1581
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,240
us what you did to it

1582
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,460
um and then what we're going to do is

1583
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,619
compile that into a great big research

1584
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:48,540
acceleration bundle that can provide

1585
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,579
kind of a meta view of how all these

1586
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,619
different things are working on this

1587
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:53,940
data

1588
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,980
um and then we come into the explanatory

1589
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,400
Workshop so uh next summer the idea is

1590
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,440
to have a second phase of this and all

1591
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,700
this spring what we're going to be doing

1592
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,920
is having discussions and blog posts and

1593
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
Forum discussions and so on

1594
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,059
workshops about all the different

1595
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,500
interesting things we're finding things

1596
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,359
to go look at things like I just showed

1597
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:13,619
you and all the stuff I didn't get to

1598
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:15,240
fit into this talk

1599
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,980
um things that you guys find and tell us

1600
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:17,880
about

1601
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,220
and we hope you find some topic

1602
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,660
something that's interesting some

1603
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,099
observation about the data some

1604
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,440
suggestion for improved performance

1605
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,319
um some new way of evaluating the data

1606
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,599
and submit it for a workshop that we're

1607
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,220
going to be holding next summer

1608
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,720
and um if you want to subscribe

1609
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,880
um and if I put something in the chat

1610
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,400
hopefully everybody can see

1611
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,980
um so I'll just

1612
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,260
copy this message right here into the

1613
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,500
chat

1614
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:53,819
uh everyone

1615
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:56,400
okay

1616
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,740
and uh all you have to do right now is

1617
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,960
sign up for a newsletter and it'll just

1618
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,640
let you know the next time there's some

1619
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,140
pretty pictures to look at you don't

1620
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,880
have to do anything

1621
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,339
um but if you would like to participate

1622
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:09,960
you can either spend just a short amount

1623
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,819
of time to to send us a de-identified

1624
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:13,440
data set or a longer amount of time to

1625
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,300
come look through them with us and

1626
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,079
that's all we got so thank you very much

1627
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,460
um

1628
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,480
if there's any questions

1629
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,680
so flooded on 5 30 on the dot with no

1630
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,059
time for questions I've only asked you

1631
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:32,099
questions I haven't received any but I'm

1632
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:33,300
happy to

1633
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,859
Mike's willing to stick around a little

1634
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:36,780
bit if people do have questions

1635
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,240
oh yeah we can stay here uh we see if

1636
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,200
any questions come in

1637
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:52,140
where can you access the data set so

1638
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,480
that is right here all you do is you

1639
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,839
type in

1640
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,319
SD nest to type in St Nest into Google

1641
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:06,720
stands for synthetic data Nest so SD

1642
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,880
nest and then this is the link you want

1643
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,020
to click right up top here

1644
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,420
and you click that link right here this

1645
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,460
is the GitHub page and this is the

1646
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,859
diverse Community data excerpts

1647
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,359
go there

1648
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,400
shows to everything

1649
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,859
by the same token

1650
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:27,660
on that so I guess actually I can show

1651
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,099
real quick too I didn't show the readme

1652
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:32,940
the readme has a batch of usage guidance

1653
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,000
to go look through

1654
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,680
um and please give feel free to give us

1655
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,880
feedback on that you can just use the

1656
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,520
data for whatever purpose you want to so

1657
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,500
um feel free to give us feedback uh it's

1658
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,180
GitHub issues

1659
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:45,960
um

1660
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,180
anything that you're interested in

1661
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,420
uh okay that's that

1662
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,240
um also on that same page

1663
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,059
is that report tool so this gives you

1664
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,440
all the instructions for running the

1665
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,380
