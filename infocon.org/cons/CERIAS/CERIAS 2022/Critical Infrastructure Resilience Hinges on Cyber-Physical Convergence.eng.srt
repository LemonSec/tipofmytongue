1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
we are extremely fortunate to have such

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,040
a distinguished speaker this afternoon

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,919
uh david mussington has had a career

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,160
in helping protect the

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,719
nation's facilities and infrastructure

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,040
he's done everything from being a

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
professor of practice at the university

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,840
of maryland

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
to supervising security at amtrak

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
he's worked with the national security

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,119
council

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,400
he's worked with the department of

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,599
defense

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,720
and

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,599
most recently he has a role as an

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,600
executive assistant director

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,559
at our department of homeland security

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
there's more you can read about him

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
online but rather than take any more of

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
his time

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,079
let me introduce dr david mussington all

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
right thank you and if i could ask

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
someone to scroll to slide two please

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,840
while you're doing that let me just say

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,039
uh staff gene whichever you prefer

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,559
great to finally get to do this we've

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,000
been talking about doing this for years

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,360
so it's it's fun to finally get to speak

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,159
serious on on a topic that as you said

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,680
i've been working on for a long time

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
critical infrastructure resilience and

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
cyber physical convergence um

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
you know one of the jobs one of the

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
parts of this job is the most fun is is

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
engaging with people who are interested

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
in the mission

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
and

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
especially from the vantage point of

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
someone who does cyber security but also

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
does physical security and this job is

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
in the infrastructure security division

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,240
which

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
in the parliament of uh cisa is one of

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
the six mission divisions um

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
prior to scissor being created in 2018

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,159
the physical mission set pretty much

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,399
dominated that with the counterterrorism

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,000
focus with critical infrastructure and

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
cyber as add-ons

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
since 2018 that's flipped with cyber

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,600
being the lead missionary with the

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,399
others

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
um in

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,520
overlapping

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
circles or in a venn diagram where the

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,119
critical infrastructure problems that is

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,200
sort of a resultant of the of the

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
overlapping of counter terrorism and

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
physical infrastructure security soft

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
targets and crowded places and cyber

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
security critical infrastructure cyber

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
risk as the the real mission

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,319
set elements

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
um but anyway that's that's sort of the

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
overarching um picture of what scissor

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,760
does

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
but you know we share some things in

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
common with series actually we both want

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
the best training in education fairly

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
skilled cyber security workforce we

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
worry a lot about um

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
recruiting retaining and laterally

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
ingesting i suppose mid-career cyber

74
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,000
security experts and subject matter

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
experts in other disciplines where we

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,920
have work and we

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
suffer some of the same dilemmas that

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
the private sector does when they're

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
trying to recruit

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
uh personnel it's difficult when you

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
can't compete on pay

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,599
so what we substitute instead is mission

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
and problem-set attractiveness that

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,879
means that we're typically

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,800
oversubscribed even though

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,159
as part of the federal government it's

87
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,959
very

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
you know it's a time-consuming process

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
to sort of actually get hired on but

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
once you are you tend to have a pretty

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,159
rewarding um reporting experience a lot

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
of people come back after being here for

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,680
a little while and a lot of people are

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,159
banging on the door trying to get in so

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,480
cyber security cyber education

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
risk education and risk communication to

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
critical infrastructures is all part of

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,360
our our set of responsibilities

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
so just

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,440
for the sake of um the basics i'll

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
answer the what is scissor question

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,560
um

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
and you know we're at a pretty unique

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
moment in

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
u.s history because after a decade or

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
more and i've expected

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
knowing me at least that that long

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
probably longer

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
we have a dedicated national cyber

110
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,319
agency responsible for critical

111
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319
infrastructure risk mitigation

112
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
um that was an aspiration for a lot of

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,560
for a long time there was dispute on

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
whether a specific agency without

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
responsibility was a viable or b

116
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
likely to succeed given the other

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
equities in place from the private

118
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,599
sector and from other sector risk

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,120
management agencies with overlapping

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
responsibilities

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
nonetheless in 2018 we were created as

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
the nation's cyber and infrastructure

123
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
defense agency within the tour of

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600
homeland security now the difference

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
2018 made was that previously we were a

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
headquarters section

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,639
after 2018 we were freestanding

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,320
components sort of like uh cbp or fema

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
so created by the congress with specific

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
attitudes

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
specific ideas rather that we wouldn't

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
be a traditional governmental

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
bureaucracy now we aspire to be

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,400
different from government but we're

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
still government so we have a lot of the

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
same habits for example this is my

137
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
seventh meeting of today

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
we tend to meet about everything and we

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
need paperwork and memoranda to

140
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
start doing anything and to know whether

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
we in fact have succeeded

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
a lot of bureaucracy here but less

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
bureaucracy than dod where i worked a

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
while ago

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
um

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
rather than bureaucracy what we live for

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
is collaboration collaboration with the

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
public private sector public sector

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,759
agencies across the federal space the

150
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
interagency with state local territorial

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
and tribal jurisdictions and

152
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,360
most importantly with the private sector

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
where much of the critical

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,440
infrastructure set is owned operated and

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
risk managed so what we have to do is

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
make sure that we have a value

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
proposition for what we're trying to

158
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,720
achieve that is

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
we if we are seen as not adding to the

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,479
solution

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
to critical infrastructure cyber risks

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
and physical risks then we won't be

163
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,199
invited to the party we don't have legal

164
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
authorities to make people do what we

165
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
suggest we suggest best practices we

166
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
have services that allow people to

167
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
assess their risk exposure we have

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
advice through um protective security

169
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
advisors and cyber security advisors

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
deployed in 10 different scissor regions

171
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
which are the same

172
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
same geographic footprint as fema

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
regions to provide assistance to

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
government to the private sector should

175
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,199
they seek it or should they

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
seek it especially after an incident

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
ransomware or something similar

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
but it's a voluntary proposition

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
that needs to show value in order for us

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,039
to sort of achieve our mission ends

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
so collaboration and cooperation for

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
information sharing for action

183
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,160
for risk conversations to promote risk

184
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,479
awareness of parts of scissors mission

185
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,199
but not the totality of scissors mission

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,319
and i'll

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
sort of get to some more detail and some

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
more proactive elements in a few minutes

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
but i want to sort of describe the main

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
roles first so first

191
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
we are with the operational lead for

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
federal civilian executive branch cyber

193
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
security now what does that mean it

194
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,400
means that for fsem or federal civilian

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
executive branch agency no that does not

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
include the intelligence community or

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
dod

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,440
um we're responsible for implementing

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
fisma guidance

200
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
um or or making sure the agencies adhere

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
to fisma guidance in the way they

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
operate their networks and computers

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
uh that means reporting it means

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
patching it means um life cycles

205
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
security risk management and everything

206
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,800
associated with it

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
the second key portion of our of our

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
mission i suppose is to serve as the

209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
national

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,759
coordinator for critical infrastructure

211
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
security and resilience

212
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,880
under the

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
national infrastructure protection plan

214
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
of 2013 and more importantly under the

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
homeland security act of 2002

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,479
sizza inherits those roles from dhs or

217
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
it basically has been delegated those

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
roles by the secretary of homeland

219
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
security that means we lead the national

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,080
effort to understand and manage and

221
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
reduce cyber and physical risk to all

222
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,360
critical infrastructures and we do that

223
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,639
without

224
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
outside of the federal space the ability

225
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,440
to mandate behavior now there's a couple

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
of exceptions to that we actually do

227
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,720
regulate in the chemical facilities

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,319
anti-terrorism area

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,680
and obviously in

230
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
the federal civilian

231
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
sector that i just described we have

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
some mandatory powers but everywhere

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,000
else

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,120
we are

235
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
working with

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
agencies like doe that have some sort of

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,080
regulatory impact in their sector of

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,319
responsibility but those aren't cis

239
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,840
authorities so it's a collaborative

240
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
enterprise there as well

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
so we lead through example we lead

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,399
through the power of

243
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
speaking on behalf of the nation on

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
homeland security and critical

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
infrastructure cyber security but we're

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,919
doing that an environment where

247
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
most of the important actors have the

248
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,480
option of ignoring what we say

249
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
now they can't really ignore us because

250
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,200
we can have we have the potential to

251
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
to make their behavior look in a bad

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
light for example when we point out

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
cyber risk best practices that people

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
are ignoring um companies may

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
may feel embarrassed their shareholders

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,959
may maybe may be upset reputational

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
damage after all and state and local

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,640
territorial and tribal authorities may

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
be

260
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
maybe upset that they feel that they're

261
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
being made to bear risks that they

262
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
wouldn't otherwise be bearing

263
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,519
but be that as it may cesar as a

264
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,399
national coordinator depends a lot on on

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
its reputation and it's

266
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,519
it's justifiable i think stands as a

267
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
kind of neutral third party that speaks

268
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
on behalf of homeland security writ

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,959
large rather than on

270
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
um any specific

271
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
um cloistered interest

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
so

273
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
the approach we

274
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
take to this is sort of all hazards in

275
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
one sense but one hazard in another

276
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
sense by all hazards it means that we're

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
interested we're interested in

278
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
disruption of critical infrastructure or

279
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,480
preventing mitigating disruption to

280
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
critical infrastructures whatever its

281
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
source be that purposeful or not

282
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
purposeful in the non-purposeful or

283
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
natural accident or disaster all hazards

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,240
area we collaborate with fema we

285
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
collaborate with other agencies that

286
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,640
have

287
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
um response responsibilities

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
under something called the stafford act

289
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
we're often called upon to do

290
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,160
critical infrastructure risk assessments

291
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,320
that show risk exposure and provide data

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
and insights on risk mitigation

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
for the purposeful side where you've got

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
an attacker of concern or an adversary

295
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
of concern

296
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
we're

297
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
perhaps a bridge between

298
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,279
the defense community the intelligence

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
community law enforcement

300
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
and the critical infrastructure

301
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
stakeholders themselves so we're we're

302
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,079
in a sense a standing a stand-in

303
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,880
for

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
um

305
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
the more blunt instruments of

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,160
investigation or defense

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
so at the end of the day we're trying to

308
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,880
fulfill

309
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
overlapping roles the first role again

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
is we're trying to speak authoritatively

311
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
on critical infrastructure risk cyber

312
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
and physical

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
second we're trying to fulfill that

314
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
national coordinator role

315
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
where we are sector risk management

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,079
agency for eight out of the 16 critical

317
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
infrastructure sectors

318
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
um we try and

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,279
operate as a sector risk management

320
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
agency from a position of as an example

321
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
to other federal agencies

322
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
and so that we can

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
assess

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
capability

325
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
of other agencies like doe and dot et

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
cetera

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
and make sure that we're all offering

328
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,160
the same services to critical

329
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
infrastructures

330
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
of which you can put information sharing

331
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
the information itself in that bucket

332
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,279
you can put services self-assessment

333
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,920
tools actual assessment

334
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,399
activities by our personnel or bisection

335
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
risk management agency personnel

336
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
we also of course sponsor university

337
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
research and we have

338
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
relationships with most of the national

339
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
labs so sector

340
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
assessments often get done to contract

341
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
with national labs under our branding in

342
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,480
a sense

343
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,880
we also do um maintain awareness of

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
intelligence and scientific

345
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
trends which may be predictive of future

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,279
critical infrastructure challenges um so

347
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
paying attention to where technology is

348
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,519
going 5g for example

349
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,800
um

350
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,440
helps us give advice that

351
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,040
isn't doesn't become obsolete quickly

352
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
so let me turn from

353
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
from the why we do it the legal

354
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
policy context to the

355
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
issue of cyber physical convergence that

356
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
i want to focus on today

357
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,600
so

358
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
you know it's a commonplace observation

359
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
that we live in hybrid connect

360
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
hyper-connected world

361
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,639
where cyber and physical

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
domains technical domains overlap with

363
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,959
each other where change is exponential

364
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
often unpredictable

365
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
you can't really talk anymore about

366
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
security and risk management in a cyber

367
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
domain without taking physical effects

368
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
into into account and vice versa

369
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
in addition in the evolving threat

370
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
environment our emissions growth that

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,839
then added

372
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,079
scissors concern with cyber physical

373
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,440
risk

374
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
is also being driven by an increasing

375
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
reliance or the observation that there's

376
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
an increased reliance on linked systems

377
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
and networks again commonplace

378
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
observations the more dependent we

379
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
become on computers and on critical

380
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
infrastructures

381
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
vulnerable critical infrastructures and

382
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,519
computers the more the security risks

383
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
become of concern

384
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
so we need to approach security we think

385
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
from an integrated cyber and physical

386
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,440
standpoint

387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
the same way we need to also join in

388
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
collaborative public private models of

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
response because the problems owned by

390
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
both sides

391
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
so we've done that in a few ways i'm

392
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,000
going to go through some executive

393
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
orders and some policy documents

394
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
principles that we bring to bear on this

395
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
problem

396
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
now as you may know i'm a political

397
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,160
appointee and we think our approach in

398
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,399
the biden harris administration differs

399
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,760
from some of the

400
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,880
some of our

401
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
our predecessors i think

402
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,360
the biggest difference might be an overt

403
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
approach that says we need risk

404
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
reduction not just risk management

405
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
we've been managing risk for much of the

406
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
two decades that i've been working in

407
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
this in this broad area

408
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
and

409
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,560
the question has to be asked are we in a

410
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
measurably better situation now than we

411
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
were in 2010 when i joined the obama

412
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
administration for example

413
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,360
is the threat more managed and deterred

414
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
are defenses more able to handle

415
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
unpredictable adversary

416
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,800
behaviors i think the answer to both of

417
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
those is no and i think there's a lot of

418
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
reasons why that's true

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
but i'm going to sort of try and frame

420
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
this but against the may 12th 2021

421
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,279
executive order that president biden

422
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,399
side

423
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,160
entitled improving the nation's cyber

424
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
security to support our nation's cyber

425
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
security and protect the critical

426
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
infrastructure and federal government

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
networks

428
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,399
so there's more to the title but you get

429
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
the you get the focus

430
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
in response to that executive order that

431
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
again create framed this more expansive

432
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
risk reduction

433
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
aspiration or ambition

434
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
scissor adopted

435
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
a couple of um

436
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
initiatives that show i think our

437
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
revised approach

438
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,040
first we issue the cloud security

439
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
technical reference architecture

440
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
designed to guide agencies in an already

441
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,199
planned secure migration to the cloud so

442
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
previously there wasn't a an

443
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
authoritative technical reference or

444
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
architecture articulated by dhs at least

445
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
to guide agencies in how they'd

446
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
use clouds or cloud services so the

447
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,480
migration was underway without clear

448
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
guidance on what to do

449
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
second we adopted a overtly

450
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
a pretty common um

451
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,680
concept from the private sector zero

452
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,720
trust maturity model for understanding

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
the strategies that agencies should

454
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,759
adopt

455
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,360
in the way they architected their

456
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,279
networks and and device interconnection

457
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,800
we also provide several ways that

458
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
scissor services can support zero trust

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,040
solutions

460
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,079
um allowing us to leverage

461
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
the powers we do have as the federal

462
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,120
civilian agency um oversight for cyber

463
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,639
security

464
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
to converge on a zero trust environment

465
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,279
from where we are now

466
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
so xero trust obviously can be used as a

467
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
way for agencies to secure their

468
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,079
application and data within the

469
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
enterprise as opposed to focusing on

470
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
traditional network parameter models

471
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,360
which the federal government

472
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
has been hanging on to far too long

473
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
additionally cesar developed two

474
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,440
playbooks in november 2021 responding to

475
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,399
the executive executive order 1.4028

476
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,519
first is

477
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,880
the federal government's cyber security

478
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,400
incident and vulnerability response

479
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
second you know these provides

480
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
civilian agencies with a standard set of

481
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,039
procedures for vulnerability and

482
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
incident management

483
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
impact impacting federal networks there

484
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,720
was guidance before but it wasn't

485
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
authoritative and in one place

486
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
certainly with a sizzle scissor label

487
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
reinforced by our authorities

488
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
institutionally we also developed

489
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,720
something called the joint cyber defense

490
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,559
collaborative

491
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,960
it was launched in august of last year

492
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
um we

493
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,760
launched.ransomware.gov which was a

494
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
one-stop shop to tell people how to

495
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
repair and respond to ransomware

496
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
incidents

497
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
we reformed the trusted interconnection

498
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
tick 3.0

499
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
procedure or set of procedures

500
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,840
that guide how federal civilian agencies

501
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,799
access the internet and cloud services

502
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,400
and again we've been publishing best

503
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
practices guidance

504
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,440
to

505
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
the public sector which has been

506
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
imitated in the private sector just

507
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
adopted as a best practice

508
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
um also in definitions of what due

509
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,480
diligence and do and standards of care

510
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,240
are in critical infrastructure um

511
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
cyber security risk management

512
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,200
um

513
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
i'll skip over this is a global strategy

514
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
which um i invite you to go to

515
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
scissor.gov and review

516
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
we've also created a security advisory

517
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
committee with some corporate um private

518
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
sector representation

519
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
to give the scissor director director

520
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
easterly

521
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,799
access to academic and private sector

522
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
expertise in framing the way scissor is

523
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,600
operated and run

524
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,240
so that's sort of the the institutional

525
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,120
um

526
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
initiative based

527
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,080
um

528
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
flow down from the may 21st last year

529
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
executive order

530
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
a couple of words on the threat

531
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
landscape the people

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
uh on this um

533
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
webinar probably know as well as we do

534
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
here since um you know i'm not i'm not

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
convinced that the insights we get

536
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,919
inside

537
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,760
buildings like this one are better than

538
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
the ones i used to read when i actually

539
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
had chances to read actual uh academic

540
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
literature on this topic but anyway

541
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,360
um

542
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
the last year's taught as anything it's

543
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
the threat landscape is only going to

544
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
get more and more complex and

545
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,880
threatening

546
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
i am to be uh fairly pessimistic about

547
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
the way the threat landscape's evolving

548
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
but um you know i'm prepared to be

549
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
convinced by by contrary evidence

550
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
having said that according to the

551
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
digital journal ransomware damage has

552
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
increased by 935 since 2021.

553
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
and as long 4g showed

554
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
um since december of 2021 the threat

555
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
landscape is not getting easier to

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
manage

557
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
the mission to protect our critical

558
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
infrastructure's vital systems and

559
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
functions

560
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
has become undoubtedly more important

561
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
but our capabilities to do so are still

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
lacking

563
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,600
and the risk is exacerbated by the

564
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
purposeful strategic action of

565
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,600
nation-states as threat actors

566
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,320
even if threat actors aren't attributed

567
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,200
as nation states often states use

568
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
proxies

569
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
non-state actors with whom they can

570
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
disavow connections um to

571
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
seed the battlefield surveil the

572
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,320
battlefield or undertake micro level

573
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,840
actions theft um

574
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
generating additional mal information

575
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
online

576
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
and just proliferating attack tools

577
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
in ways that make the threat environment

578
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
much more difficult and much less

579
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,679
predictable

580
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,360
from solar winds to not petya to the

581
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
extortion and ransomware

582
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,280
activity of russian organized crime

583
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
it's pretty clear to see that

584
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,120
you know the criminals are going where

585
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
the money is and the money is in

586
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
interconnected systems and institutions

587
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
and individuals

588
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
our ability to predict and preempt

589
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
those activities

590
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
is not converging on the risk and threat

591
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
fast enough

592
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
do i think we're falling behind yes i do

593
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
think we're falling behind because these

594
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
asymmetric advantages of the threat

595
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
actor are not being matched by

596
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,679
innovation and agility on the defense

597
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,520
yet that's why the joint cyber defense

598
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
collaborative which basically shares the

599
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,720
situational awareness of big

600
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,919
internet

601
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
presences i think aws thing

602
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
microsoft think palo alto networks

603
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
cloudflare etc

604
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
who who have

605
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,520
enhanced awareness on activity online

606
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,400
have advanced awareness on where malware

607
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,960
comes from what the incidence of attack

608
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,919
is

609
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,360
and perhaps can empower interdiction of

610
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
negative behavior uh in advance of where

611
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,039
government is

612
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
i think that's

613
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,960
sort of the the overall summary of sort

614
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
of what i had to say really that

615
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
the

616
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
internet and cyberspace as a whole are

617
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
not becoming more manageable

618
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,480
what they are is a source of risk that

619
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
the nation

620
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
has to innovate in terms of organization

621
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,120
in terms of

622
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,640
concepts for

623
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
mitigating cyber physical risk in new

624
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
ways

625
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,679
and that's a challenge to us here

626
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,840
organizationally is challenged to the

627
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
science and engineering research that we

628
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,640
sponsor this challenge to our outreach

629
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
that we do through these mechanisms and

630
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,440
policies i've tried to outline um you

631
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,200
know at the end of the day the country's

632
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
most vital systems and functions are a

633
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
shared responsibility

634
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
the mission of establishing strong and

635
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
effective cyber security can only be

636
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
established through collaborative

637
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
partnerships across the public and

638
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
private sectors one of the biggest

639
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
challenges there is the building or the

640
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,080
destruction of trust relationships

641
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,679
between key players that have

642
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
contrasting incentives to collaborate

643
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,080
after all private sector often fears

644
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
regulation or government intervention

645
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,000
into business operations

646
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,760
and governments sometimes think the

647
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
business is more interested in profit

648
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
and loss than they are

649
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,520
in national security after all

650
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
businesses are in business to be in

651
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
business not for homeland national

652
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
security that's our responsibility

653
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,200
but it's really our collective

654
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
responsibility to execute

655
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
those contrasts of in

656
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
incentives

657
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,679
not necessarily conflicts of interest

658
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,880
but contrasts and incentives can impede

659
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
um the defense properly organizing

660
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
itself and i think that's something that

661
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
i've become more aware of since i took

662
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
this job

663
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,240
than i was when i was just researching

664
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,159
um you know there are other equities in

665
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,520
play here as well

666
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
the notion that law enforcement and

667
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
crime

668
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
should be the locus of federal policy in

669
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
this area is one that has some adherence

670
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
inside the government and inside the

671
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
private sector to those who prioritize

672
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
crime control

673
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
and crime reduction

674
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
in cyber security there are a whole set

675
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,559
of legal and other mechanisms that

676
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,279
that

677
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,120
favor investigation they favor

678
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
prosecution that may argue

679
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
in an opposite direction from those who

680
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,600
are interested in enhanced and shared

681
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,240
situational awareness on risk response

682
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,600
um that

683
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
leads to

684
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,919
better ability to defend at scale rather

685
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
than prosecuting individuals for

686
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
negative behavior

687
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
i want to make sure that you understand

688
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,440
that

689
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
cisa has a collaborative non-law

690
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,919
enforcement non-intelligence community

691
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,559
perspective on cyber security

692
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,760
and that we haven't forgotten our

693
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
critical infrastructure physical

694
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
security origins

695
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,400
in that

696
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
we have to do both just as an example i

697
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,559
spent the last couple of weeks worrying

698
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,000
about predicting faith-based

699
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
institutions from

700
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
active shooter threats

701
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,559
and

702
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
worrying about school safety

703
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,919
from both physical

704
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,360
and

705
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,080
mdm style threats that's as much of a

706
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
concern at scissor as

707
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
the protection of critical

708
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,120
infrastructure from cyber physical

709
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
convergent threats and risks

710
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,760
so there's a broad span of control issue

711
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
at scissor where

712
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,480
we

713
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
have a lot to do

714
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
and like most people in government we

715
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
don't think we have the resources to

716
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
fully execute optimally on all of them

717
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
um but our goal nonetheless

718
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
is to protect critical infrastructure

719
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,279
cyber and physical and all of those who

720
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,039
depend on it

721
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,679
for the benefit of the country

722
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,520
and individual citizens for safety and

723
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
security

724
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,279
so with that um gene i'm ready to stop

725
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,679
and just take questions um

726
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,840
over to

727
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,760
you uh that sounds great

728
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,279
i but we did get uh your slides so thank

729
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
you for that

730
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,159
um

731
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,840
do you want to go through on the q a or

732
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
would you like me to read them to you um

733
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,159
it's probably go better if you read them

734
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
given our connectivity challenges today

735
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
all right sounds fine

736
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
um is cesa recommending that critical

737
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
infrastructure entities take additional

738
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,840
steps

739
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
to prepare for the possibility that

740
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
russia will launch a cyber attack amid

741
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
detention with ukraine

742
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
what is sysa doing to help these

743
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
companies and music municipalities

744
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
prepare

745
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
and thank you

746
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
so cesa is has issued a sequence of

747
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
advisories over the last

748
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,039
weeks

749
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,720
um recommending

750
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,000
um redoubling efforts to um implement

751
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
prior guidance that we issue best

752
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,720
practices

753
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
to secure systems from ransomware

754
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,360
identity theft left and other vectors

755
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,559
that are used

756
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
by adversaries of all kinds to threaten

757
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,679
key systems we do have specific outreach

758
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,640
to critical infrastructures to reinforce

759
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
that messaging that's probably as far as

760
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
i can go um we're mindful of geoff

761
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
geopolitical issues that

762
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,000
change the threat con risk constellation

763
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
and we are paying attention to as is the

764
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
entire u.s government interagency u.s

765
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,200
government to threat trends in ukraine

766
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,799
yeah and i would uh

767
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,120
imagine from what we know about general

768
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,679
world affairs there are other

769
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
uh other players on the scene who might

770
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,159
like to take advantage of the tension

771
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,880
and make it look like somebody else

772
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
so we uh

773
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,480
we should not lose our focus or put all

774
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
our focus probably in just one place

775
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
i think that's right i think that you

776
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
know

777
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
from our point of view

778
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
disruption to critical infrastructure is

779
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
the concern and whoever is trying to

780
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
execute those just

781
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
generate those disruptions um has our

782
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,799
attention um and

783
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
given that a lot of attribution at least

784
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
maybe not technical attribution but sort

785
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,399
of functional and political attribution

786
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,399
is often after the fact and we need to

787
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,840
pay attention to the disruption and

788
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
mitigating things

789
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,679
um you know at the incident level or

790
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
pre-incident level

791
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
and that means

792
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,080
for the defense um reinforcing their

793
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
adherence to some best practices that

794
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
are commonly done

795
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,120
great

796
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
another question could you please speak

797
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,320
to the specific roles and

798
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,559
responsibilities of the infrastructure

799
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
security division and the most prominent

800
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,200
efforts led by isd

801
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,640
okay so the infrastructure security

802
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,840
division is

803
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,120
has

804
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
a complicated set of roles and broad

805
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,159
scope of responsibilities um broadly

806
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,440
speaking we're responsible for the

807
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
physical infrastructure security

808
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,840
programs and responsibilities of

809
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
scissors so that means

810
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
counter ied it means infrastructure

811
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,080
assessments and analysis

812
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
it means school safety doing something

813
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,440
about both

814
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
threats to school buildings and

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
institutions and students but also

816
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
threats to the education institute

817
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
education complex including school

818
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,159
boards and those who who create threats

819
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,559
to public education

820
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,880
we also do something

821
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
in our security programs division that

822
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,880
addresses not only school safety but

823
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
infrastructure um security of public

824
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,960
facilities so i think the capital on the

825
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
6th of january and how and this and the

826
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,679
issues of security that

827
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,000
became visible there what to do about

828
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
them is within isd's uh

829
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
subdivision so that we've done we've

830
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,919
done analyses of that event

831
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
the successes and failures of law

832
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
enforcement and other responses and

833
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
we've made recommendations for better

834
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
national capital region security as a

835
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,120
result um

836
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
i think about this we

837
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,320
regulate in the area of chemical

838
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
security so the chemical facility

839
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
anti-terrorism standards where we have

840
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
303

841
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
um chemicals of interest as they're

842
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,279
called in the legislation where we

843
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,960
regulate physical

844
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
custody and the conditions of transfer

845
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,919
and we inspect facilities according to

846
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,679
that regulatory code

847
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,480
um let me go down the list here

848
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,399
um for integrated assessments and

849
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,559
analysis we have a an annual risk

850
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
assessment program for critical

851
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
infrastructure regions

852
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,480
um across the ten regions we do eight to

853
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
ten our apps regional resilience

854
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
assessment plan assessments which are

855
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,880
multi-year in nature so for example

856
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,399
we've we've got a couple that are

857
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,480
completing in

858
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,919
the port authority of new york we're

859
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
doing similar ones in texas in

860
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
california and elsewhere

861
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
we start three to five new starts every

862
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,320
year so we have three to five completing

863
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,760
and three to five starting every year

864
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
we've been doing that for over a decade

865
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,440
so we have a lot of legacy data on

866
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
critical infrastructure hardness and

867
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,720
resilience

868
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,240
which can be used by people who are

869
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,720
creating big projects for example in the

870
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
president's infrastructure plan we're

871
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
providing support to mitch landrieu's

872
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
office to make sure that the attack

873
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
surface physical and cyber

874
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,000
is at least

875
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
um

876
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
let me

877
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
how can i say this it makes sense to try

878
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,679
and design security principles into new

879
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,520
infrastructure projects rather before

880
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,840
rather than after so we're trying to

881
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,279
help in the design and crafting of those

882
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,440
infrastructure plans so that when we get

883
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,600
new infrastructure it's resilient over

884
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,840
the long term rather than short term

885
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,320
i think that's kind of a

886
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,080
quick tour of what the infrastructure

887
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
security division does

888
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,480
um the other question

889
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,360
uh yeah so that's

890
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,640
that's great

891
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,600
um

892
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,519
so here's another question

893
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,200
how is system supporting talent

894
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,840
development particularly in ot ics

895
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,279
security

896
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,000
okay so we have talent development in a

897
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,360
couple of ways

898
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
we have mentorship and internship

899
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,679
programs where we hire students um for

900
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,240
short term to long term because often

901
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
often we hire interns as staff members

902
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
in technical areas where people's

903
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,880
education maps directly to the technical

904
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,799
needs of for example the threat hunting

905
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,919
division in the cyber security division

906
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,840
we also have outreach in two

907
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,200
universities relationships with the

908
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,480
universities

909
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
carnegie mellon i'm not sure about

910
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
relations with purdue per se but

911
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
carnegie mellon stanford

912
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
mit

913
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
and some other places we actually have

914
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,399
not a presence but close relations

915
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,000
because faculty there are affiliated

916
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
with some advisory committees that we

917
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
operate

918
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
um in terms of

919
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,399
outreach we're about to start an

920
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,519
outreach phase to hpcus where

921
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
and you know i'm directing that in a you

922
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,480
know way to

923
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
open the azimuth a little bit from the

924
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
aperture a little bit rather on the

925
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,480
institutions that we actually relate to

926
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
we have a habit like my former employers

927
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
at the university of maryland where if

928
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
we wanted to re to recruit diverse

929
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,799
faculty we would go to

930
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,399
the least diverse institutions in the

931
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,919
country thinking that we're going to do

932
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,600
better than we had done in the past so

933
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,799
we're going to break out of that pattern

934
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,159
we're going to go to a diverse set of

935
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,480
institutions both recruit staff

936
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
potentially to find research that's

937
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
going on in those institutions and try

938
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
and incentivize collaboration between

939
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,240
our research and assessment subdivisions

940
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
and activities and academic institutions

941
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,919
and there's a fair history of that

942
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,440
sometimes in collaboration with the

943
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
national labs but often independent as

944
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,159
well the asia science and technology is

945
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,320
the principal sponsor of that effort so

946
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
dhs smt is

947
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,679
the principal

948
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,320
part of dhs that we work with to reach

949
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,279
out to

950
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,559
higher education

951
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,919
um on the non-science non-um

952
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
student outreach

953
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,679
bits we just re-established the homeland

954
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,880
security

955
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
education advisory committee which is

956
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,600
comprised of university presidents

957
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,679
i'm an ex-official member of that

958
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,320
um but that that was sunset at the end

959
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
of the last administration and we took

960
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
six to eight months to recraft it with

961
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
new members

962
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,640
with

963
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,279
with a better more systematic approach

964
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,039
to interacting with universities and

965
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,159
colleges

966
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,720
that's a work in progress but um that's

967
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
what um secretary mayorkas has directed

968
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
us to do

969
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,159
thank you i'll just mention as an aside

970
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
here that to my knowledge uh dhs does

971
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
not have a relationship with

972
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
us here at purdue the way

973
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,119
some of the other universities you

974
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,159
mentioned

975
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
uh and considering we have one of the

976
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,399
oldest and the largest cyber security

977
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
group in the country

978
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,639
it seems odd that that hasn't been

979
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,719
pursued so maybe we can take that

980
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,800
offline at some point

981
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
yes absolutely

982
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,918
uh

983
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,440
so

984
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
another question here and i'm not sure

985
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
i'll ask the question or to to re-type

986
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,520
the question it's can you give some

987
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
examples used in cisa and uh

988
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
you need to tell us examples of what

989
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
because i can't

990
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,159
i can't do that

991
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,440
um

992
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
one question is i would like to hear

993
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
your perspective on insider threats in

994
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,639
the context of critical infrastructure

995
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
security

996
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,719
um so insider threats are the single

997
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,760
most threatening um

998
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
factor in trying to secure an enterprise

999
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
because they're the hardest to detect

1000
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
but when you try to detect them there's

1001
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,000
all sorts of reasons why you may fail

1002
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,640
um to detect them first and we're

1003
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,839
working with that here at uh scissor

1004
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,839
organizational culture matters and if

1005
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,599
you start to target

1006
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,320
your own employees your own staff as

1007
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,119
threats that disincentivizes a lot of

1008
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,359
the community-mindedness and loyalty

1009
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,160
that is the best protection against

1010
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
insider threats

1011
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
so the problem of detection is

1012
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,240
is a massive one and it's one where

1013
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,440
you know we

1014
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
we have some concepts and we have some

1015
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
publications on scissors.gov that point

1016
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,520
towards some best practices for doing so

1017
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,320
for

1018
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,160
you know making sure that you have the

1019
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,400
proper infrastructure in place um to

1020
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
track behavior that you think correlates

1021
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,280
with

1022
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
with risk where people over

1023
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
for example

1024
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,359
um

1025
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,839
ignore privilege restrictions on their

1026
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,720
role

1027
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,640
so the people are accessing information

1028
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,520
that is beyond their their their

1029
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
their professional need to know and this

1030
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,119
isn't to impose the governmental need to

1031
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,040
know principles on the private sector

1032
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
but if people have specific roles in

1033
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
organizations and specific accesses to

1034
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,680
um information that correlates with that

1035
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
role and if you get systematic

1036
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,800
violations of expected access procedures

1037
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
and behaviors that probably is is it

1038
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,240
something that can be concerning another

1039
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,599
thing is in securing intellectual

1040
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,520
property

1041
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
in a complex production cycle there are

1042
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,160
often reasons why strong constraints on

1043
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
the diffusion of information can defeat

1044
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,720
business goals so again you have that

1045
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,480
counter incentive where what you're

1046
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,040
trying to do for insider threat and risk

1047
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,119
mitigation can actually

1048
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,440
complicate your business so if the

1049
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
choice is between

1050
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,880
close tracking of insider threats and a

1051
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,640
free-flowing business environment that

1052
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
increases the bottom line guess which

1053
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,760
one gets selected so you know insider

1054
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
threats are a chronic

1055
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,720
um source of underperformance i think in

1056
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
industrial security

1057
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,280
venues public and private sector alike

1058
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
and we have some standards on

1059
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,119
scissor.gov that suggest a path forward

1060
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,040
that's great um

1061
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,839
and

1062
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,640
what you outline there is is a problem

1063
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,760
that

1064
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,599
many organizations face outside of the

1065
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,920
ones you look at so

1066
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,240
thank you for that um

1067
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
question here are there tiers or levels

1068
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
of critical infrastructure

1069
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,960
if so could you elaborate on those

1070
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
different tiers

1071
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,599
so

1072
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
you know intuitively one can think that

1073
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,320
there are tiers of critical

1074
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
infrastructures and historically bhs has

1075
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,160
talked about things called lifeline

1076
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,680
sectors which include you know

1077
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,839
electricity power generation public

1078
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,520
health um transportation um

1079
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
financial

1080
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
sector management the government and

1081
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,079
government services so that would ten

1082
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
years ago that would have been people's

1083
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
sort of hardcore of critical

1084
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,960
infrastructures that had a higher

1085
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,200
priority the reason they were argued to

1086
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
be a priority was because they enabled

1087
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,119
the economy or enabled government

1088
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,520
services or enabled security so that's

1089
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
sort of a traditional way of thinking

1090
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,599
about critical infrastructures and which

1091
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,880
one have the highest priority

1092
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,200
having said that it's it's a kind of a

1093
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,599
static list right and we keep a lot of a

1094
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,440
lot of lists of things that we think of

1095
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,760
prior priorities and then we

1096
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,960
try and

1097
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,680
manage the to the list

1098
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
we try and manage compliance to list

1099
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,320
based priority behaviors

1100
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
and we

1101
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,320
we use imperfect artifacts to

1102
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
correlate compliance with safety and

1103
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,839
security

1104
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,320
you know i'm creating a cartoon here a

1105
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,960
caricature of of the core homeland

1106
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,119
security risk management approach of the

1107
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,200
last 15 to 18 years

1108
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
um

1109
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,200
let's ask let's ask and answer the

1110
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,160
question

1111
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,599
um

1112
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,760
right now are we better evil and more

1113
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,240
situationally aware regarding risks to

1114
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
critical infrastructure than we were 15

1115
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
years ago

1116
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,960
now i argue we aren't this doesn't take

1117
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
a position on that point but i'm telling

1118
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
you that i think that we are

1119
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
not as situationally aware as we need to

1120
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,440
be

1121
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,560
and we ignore at our parallel peril

1122
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
interdependencies between these

1123
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
prioritized sectors which are actually

1124
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,599
more problematic than the sectors

1125
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,040
themselves

1126
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
so a few years ago a colleague of mine

1127
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
is now sort of leaving the agency fairly

1128
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,839
soon bob kolaski um

1129
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
sponsored the

1130
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
an innovation i think in the way we

1131
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
should think about interdependent risk

1132
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,280
which is national critical functions

1133
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
so rather than 16 critical

1134
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,599
infrastructure sectors he conceptualized

1135
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,079
he and his division 55 national critical

1136
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,160
functions which really do focus on the

1137
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,720
delivery of services to the economy

1138
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,839
and to the

1139
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,880
country now what are national critical

1140
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
functions national critical functions

1141
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,320
are essential functions

1142
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,280
so

1143
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
so significant

1144
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,760
that their disruption or denial

1145
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,280
would

1146
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,960
under would

1147
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
lead to

1148
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
critical um damage to national security

1149
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
in the national economy

1150
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,079
the textbook definition is pretty close

1151
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,160
to that it's in that may 21

1152
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,760
um

1153
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,720
executive order that i mentioned earlier

1154
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
the critical functions are things like

1155
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,760
provide electric power

1156
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
provide health care secure

1157
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,319
transportation and looking at all of the

1158
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,119
critical infrastructure pieces and nodes

1159
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,200
that contribute to the execution of

1160
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
those functions

1161
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
that's scissors approach

1162
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,839
to

1163
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,119
cyber security into critical

1164
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
infrastructure protection at the

1165
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,000
national level it means focusing on the

1166
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,920
interdependencies identifying critical

1167
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
nodes and critical clusters of

1168
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,200
dependence that scale if an adversary

1169
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,839
were to exploit them into a grievous

1170
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,240
national assault or national

1171
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
insult to um

1172
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,079
economic security

1173
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,839
public safety national security

1174
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,119
um an example of that kind of focus

1175
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,640
is

1176
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
in colonial pipelined a few months ago

1177
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,200
now ransomware attack on a pipeline

1178
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,599
operator is serious

1179
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,400
the disruptions and the gas lines and

1180
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,880
the and that and the price inflation

1181
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,520
that was triggered by the by that

1182
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,560
event

1183
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
those effects

1184
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,359
show that the function

1185
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,839
affected providing for provide fuel

1186
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,760
provide electric power provide

1187
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,200
transportation

1188
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
um that's where the effect was most

1189
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,680
visible that's where says it was focused

1190
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
making sure that we understood those

1191
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,440
risk dependencies

1192
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
not at the sector level but at the at

1193
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,920
the functional delivery of service level

1194
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,760
and that's kind of the

1195
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,480
the shift that we're that's underway on

1196
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
that it's underway

1197
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,680
in

1198
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,880
something that people may not be

1199
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,119
tracking which is the

1200
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,160
section 9002b report that was issued at

1201
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,079
the end of last year

1202
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,880
to the ndaa of 2021.

1203
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
the congress asked us to look at

1204
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,000
critical infrastructure sanctuaries how

1205
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,359
they were defined

1206
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
how federal government agencies were

1207
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
behaving in terms of risk medicaid risk

1208
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
management and risk mitigation and sort

1209
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
of articulate some new standards and new

1210
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,960
concepts for how risk at the national

1211
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,800
level and at the regional level should

1212
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
be defined and managed

1213
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,960
those ncfs national critical functions

1214
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,200
is the way that we've chosen to uh to do

1215
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,920
that they're defined again on ciso.gov

1216
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,599
the national risk management center one

1217
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,160
of our subdivisions one of our divisions

1218
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,720
has done considerable amount of work

1219
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,440
collaborating the national economy and

1220
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
critical service dependencies in the u.s

1221
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
and elsewhere

1222
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
using that conceptualization so i

1223
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
recommend that to you as a there's a

1224
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,119
better way i think of thinking about

1225
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
critical infrastructure cyber risk and

1226
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,839
physical risk

1227
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,520
so there's some follow-up to this

1228
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,680
in two parts here uh in the q a but

1229
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
does that mean that cis is moving away

1230
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,560
from the idea of esfs has dhs as a whole

1231
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,720
evaluated this perspective are they too

1232
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,280
entrenched in the current system or do

1233
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,440
these uh dovetail into the current

1234
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
system

1235
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,760
well they actually are designed to

1236
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,359
dovetail into the current system i think

1237
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,119
what they what it shows is that

1238
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,960
coordination between esf's and the ncfs

1239
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
and things like stafford act

1240
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
um

1241
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,920
needs to be reconfigured so things like

1242
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,880
ppd21 and others documents that are

1243
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
not that old but they're sufficiently

1244
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,520
old that they need to be modified to to

1245
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
meet the more modern conceptualization

1246
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,000
and there's there's gaps in

1247
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,079
responsibility or in execute or at least

1248
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,760
in execution of federal policy and

1249
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
federal support to state and local

1250
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,319
territory on tribal tribal jurisdictions

1251
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,200
for example because of the limitations

1252
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,440
of a sector perspective on its own so no

1253
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,319
we're not not abandoning the esf's we're

1254
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,400
building on those and on the national

1255
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,880
response framework and other

1256
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,800
adjacent frameworks to

1257
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,160
to in a sense

1258
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,440
bring

1259
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
the sector model into the 21st century

1260
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,359
after all it's quite old

1261
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,480
great

1262
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,680
um

1263
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,280
another question here

1264
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,079
could you please speak to isd priorities

1265
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,119
and efforts focused on climate change

1266
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,640
okay um

1267
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,079
i think i could speak to scissor

1268
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,520
priorities and efforts focused on

1269
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
climate change isd's efforts

1270
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,440
um

1271
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
fit into that broader broader

1272
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,839
concentration i think the principal area

1273
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,280
where we

1274
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
make a contribution is in our

1275
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
assessments area where we

1276
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,400
we do

1277
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,839
um

1278
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,319
integrated assessments of infrastructure

1279
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,800
risk based on all hazards

1280
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,280
so if floodplains or critical

1281
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,760
infrastructure is weakened by climate

1282
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,599
effect

1283
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,359
our research and our assessment will

1284
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,680
show that over the life of the asset so

1285
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,599
obviously big infrastructure segments

1286
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,160
bridges tunnels um

1287
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,200
metroplexes and ports around uh around

1288
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,720
on urban areas are impacted by by sea by

1289
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,280
sea level rise by erosion

1290
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,119
by flooding by

1291
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,640
greater frequency and intensity of

1292
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,319
storms all of that um

1293
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
both warrants the

1294
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,119
more frequent execution of assessments

1295
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,079
to look at infrastructure risk exposure

1296
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,440
it also

1297
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,359
allows us to articulate mitigation

1298
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
guidance to those reconstructing

1299
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,400
infrastructure think of the president's

1300
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,119
infrastructure investment and jobs act

1301
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,640
spending 1.2 trillion i believe

1302
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,680
big

1303
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,119
transportation projects are being

1304
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,480
undertaken

1305
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,960
big waste water and water treatment

1306
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,040
investments are being made

1307
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,359
from the mundane replacing lead pipe to

1308
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,160
the

1309
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
rebuilding bridges and tunnels that that

1310
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,240
are the civil engineers tell us we're

1311
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
about to break down all those things are

1312
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,920
impacted by

1313
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,400
the physical environment and climate

1314
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,599
change based disruptions to the

1315
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,359
infrastructure as we've known them so

1316
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,040
our assessments contribute to the

1317
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,079
government's

1318
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,760
database of

1319
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,319
a effect and b guidance on what to do

1320
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,480
thank you

1321
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,920
um we have run out of both questions and

1322
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,280
time

1323
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,880
uh

1324
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,599
it's been wonderful to have you here

1325
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,599
speaking with us and perhaps there'll be

1326
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,040
a future occasion we can actually get

1327
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,640
you in person

1328
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,480
and then we don't have to worry about uh

1329
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,119
connectivity and video cameras

1330
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,560
showing up here

1331
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
um

1332
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,560
yeah it would be a delight to have you

1333
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,520
come visit um i will follow up uh uh

1334
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,160
with email to you directly about that uh

1335
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440
collaboration issue absolutely and

1336
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,720
um as a reminder to our audience

1337
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
uh there will be a video of this

1338
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,520
uh

1339
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,079
which does have the slides and everybody

1340
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,040
knows

1341
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,599
yeah okay well we'll have a recording

1342
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,839
maybe not

1343
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,319
uh that will be up on the website

1344
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,119
and on youtube within a few days

1345
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,040
and also to remind you that we have

1346
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,720
another speaker next wednesday on a

1347
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,960
different topic but in the same general

1348
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,319
uh thrust area of cyber security

1349
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,119
so once again our thanks to the

1350
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,319
honorable david mussington and

1351
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,280
we

1352
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,359
look forward to future interactions and

1353
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,240
everyone please have a safe and

1354
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,079
warm afternoon or what's left of it

1355
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,480
thanks again good night

1356
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,040
you
