1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
so good afternoon so everyone so

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,799
um first today we are so happy and the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
honor to have trunk bruce give us talks

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
and uh i'm very happy to give this

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,880
introduction so

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
trunks actually is one of the

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,640
most

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
and best

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
best rated action the cyber security

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
expert and he wrote many many actually

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
articles and about actually cyber

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,439
security and the inversion i think uh

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
the people is different in this

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
classroom and of course beyond the

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
classroom i couldn't know how many

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
people have been infringed by you okay

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
and if you check his about i i want to

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
hire several scenes so

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,000
he has many many laws he is a president

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
of the brooks consulting international

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,440
but also fact he is the georgie achen

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,879
tom university his technology evergreens

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
corporate is huge and speaker writer

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
government leadership expert business

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
actually you know under an expert on the

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
market excuse me so you are reading

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
wrong in business and also doing

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,960
education so we are so um

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,000
that have very very rich experience so

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
and he got her the master of m.a

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,080
massacre from the international

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
relationship from the university of

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
chicago and

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
he has a lot of experience about his law

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
and everything i think this is very

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
important because cyber security is so

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,759
close too right the law scenes and the

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,960
legal scenes

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,759
so

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
i don't want to highlight too much about

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
this one but you can say today the trunk

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
is going to give us very very exciting

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
talk especially because it's the year

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
start the year of the 2022

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,280
and he's going to show his understanding

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
and thought about cyber security this

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,479
year

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
so let's welcome action trunk

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,280
thank you very much for that kind

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
introduction it's a pleasure to be here

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
and good afternoon everybody

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
i'll give you a short presentation i'm

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
also going to open up for questions at

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
the end

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
uh one is really the sort of the trends

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
happening in cyber security second part

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,680
is really going to go into some of the

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
emerging technologies that are impacting

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
those trends so it's a it's a pleasure

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
again to to be here and i'll start off

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
with some of the some of the interesting

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
parts

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,319
so i i always like to start my lectures

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,239
with this slide uh because it really

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,760
epitomizes

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
the situation uh we're in you know uh

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
and it was done by joel brenner who was

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
a former council for nsa

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
uh he said the internet was not built

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,160
for security yet we made it the backbone

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,680
of virtually all private sector and

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,040
government operations as well as

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
communications

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
pervasive connectivity has brought

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
dramatic gains in productivity and

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,959
pleasure but has created equally

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
dramatic vulnerabilities huge heists of

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
personal information are common in cyber

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,840
theft intellectual property and

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
infrastructure penetrations continue at

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
a frightening pace and this this was uh

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
several years ago and it's certainly

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
been exponentially

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
proved

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
the cyber heist pace has gone

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
higher in 2021 than any year it's been

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
in the past more breaches

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
more severity breaches more more money

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
and data stolen so uh we're really i

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
guess you call it a really

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
a turning point right now of how we

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
address uh cyber security as we go

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,879
forward into the next digital era

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
so what are the global cyber security

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
trends and i'm not going to cover all of

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,519
them but i'll give you some of the

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,040
highlights that i think

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
are really happening right now um you

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
know first of all um

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,319
you were seeing that uh threat actors

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
especially state-sponsored ones and

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
criminal enterprises who often cooperate

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
by the way are taking advantage of the

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
expanding cyber attack surface by using

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
the resources to employ

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
more sophisticated means of discovering

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
target vulnerabilities automating their

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
phishing attacks and finding new

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,000
directive deceptive paths for

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
infiltrating malware basically they're

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
they're using the technologies that are

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
current and including machine learning

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
and artificial intelligence

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
and surveillance and they're using them

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,680
to advantage to find gaps and exploit

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
those gaps and the problem now is also

117
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,040
that

118
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,959
many of these groups particularly these

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,640
criminal enterprises uh share

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
information on the dark web

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,040
they share tools hacking tools they

122
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
share

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
actually they trade bounties sometimes

124
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
and do all kinds of different things so

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
there's a a lot of problems with that

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
already and it makes it a global issue

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,000
obviously

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
because it's every corporation every

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
government

130
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
and and every person that's potentially

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
affected by uh by these cyber groups

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
cyber attack groups uh the other you

133
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
know thing that i will talk about a

134
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
little later on the presentation is the

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
disruptive technologies like mobility

136
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
iot internet of things and cloud

137
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
computing are bringing you know

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
operational shifts that are changing the

139
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
environment how we set up our security

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
and how we do our business

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,759
so these advances take a you know

142
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
continuous monitoring uh new analytics

143
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
and and need to have a new perception of

144
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
the new risk management profiles as we

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
proceed into this new what i call the

146
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,039
well what is called

147
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,199
the fourth digital era

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,560
industrial era

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
so the uh

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
what is the cost of these cyber security

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
and cyber threats right now this is a

152
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,560
quick synopsis

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
but um

154
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
it's true uh security investments now

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
are being driven by persistent threats

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
policy remedies workforce shortages and

157
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
technological innovation which i the

158
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
items i just mentioned to you

159
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
but now we're experiencing uh you know

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
phishing attacks still the most common

161
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
consistently a top cyber threat because

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,080
they're easy to do uh anyone can be

163
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
fished

164
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
you don't have to be a

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
you know a

166
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,600
wrong or

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
dumb to just to hook on something that

168
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
you are

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
click on something that you don't don't

170
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
uh completely recognize it could be uh

171
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,000
something from your your bank your your

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,320
boss that you think is real or something

173
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
that is from a relative you see the name

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
you see because it's constantly used

175
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
they use other people to get to you so a

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
lot of social engineering techniques so

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
phishing attacks easy to do easy to

178
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,639
automate you only need to be once

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
right for the hacker to make it

180
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
worthwhile even out of a thousand

181
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
attempts so so it's easily a a big

182
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,199
problem that uh is not going away

183
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,479
there's a lot of training and other

184
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,680
things being done

185
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
but it's still uh very difficult to to

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,520
the sophistication of some of these

187
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
attacks and the way they can mimic the

188
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
graphics on things make it almost

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
impossible

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
sometimes to know that you're being

191
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
phished

192
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
ransomware is now considered the fastest

193
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
growing cyber crime now ransomware has

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
been around a long time

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,639
almost three decades

196
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
and it's been deployed uh you know over

197
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
that time but right last year it's been

198
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,400
deployed more than ever before and

199
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,240
there's several reasons for this one is

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
that uh and the primary reason is is

201
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
that because of cryptocurrencies

202
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
criminals are able to get money um

203
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
the first primary reason for most

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,520
hackers is financial they want to gain

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
financial i mean there's other reasons

206
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
too geopolitical reasons to steal stuff

207
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
secrets etc to cause havoc but but

208
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
getting money is their primary goal and

209
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,720
they get this money now they get it in

210
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
prepaid cards and cyber currencies

211
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
cryptocurrencies that they can uh easily

212
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,599
uh

213
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
cash in on and it's more difficult for

214
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,759
authorities particularly global

215
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
authorities to actually confront them

216
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,360
and prosecute them so that's why

217
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
ransomware is so popular and and the

218
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,639
other thing is just works and there's

219
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
some pretty ingenious new uh malware

220
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
that's been invented recently off of

221
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,240
some of the old patterns of malware for

222
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
ransomware that are quite effective

223
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,759
it's estimated right now there's

224
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
actually 430 million types of malware

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
online i think that's conservative it's

226
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
probably closer to

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
twice that

228
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,639
and another conservative

229
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
estimate this came from a university of

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
maryland uh research a couple of years

231
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
ago that a cyber attack happens every 39

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
seconds i'm told now that it's actually

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
every 11 seconds

234
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
and what is true is that cyber security

235
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
will cost the world six trillion dollars

236
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
annually by the beginning of this year

237
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
which is is more than a lot of countries

238
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
gross national product

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
and uh that we're also facing a big

240
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
threat with uh

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
advanced persistent threats

242
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
uh that trojan malware that we placed

243
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
were in the attacker gains control

244
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
computer systems created back doors

245
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
obtaining access and confidential and

246
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
sensitive data and if you remember the

247
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
recent hack of solar winds uh this is a

248
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,319
good evidence of it um they were there

249
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,840
over a year before anyone noticed

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
creating back doors an opportunity to

251
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
steal stuff and plan things so that is

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
one of the bigger threats right now

253
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
looked at particularly for critical

254
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
infrastructure and the other thing

255
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
that's happening is always going to

256
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,360
happen is insider threats it could be

257
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
either negligence someone leaves

258
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,958
something unguarded or something on or

259
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,279
password stolen or administrator option

260
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,680
uh taken over or they do it deliberately

261
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
because they have a

262
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
grievance with the company or agency

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
they're working for

264
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,839
so as i mentioned

265
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,760
ransomware according to the the newest

266
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,519
world economic forum

267
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,680
report that just came out this week

268
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
80 of cyber leaders now consider

269
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
ransomware of a danger and a threat to

270
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
public safety

271
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
um they note that cybercrime ransomware

272
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
tax rose 151 percent last year and

273
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
they're an average of 270 cyber tax per

274
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
organizations in 2021 in a 31

275
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
increase on from 2020 which was a very

276
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
uh big year for breaches and each uh

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
successful breach now is costing average

278
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
of 3.6 million dollars to a company

279
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
and and then the other aspect of that is

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
after a breach becomes public the

281
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,000
average share price of the hack company

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,720
underperforms in the

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
nasdaq by uh unless you maybe have to do

284
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
something or your data or your money

285
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,399
time it's it's implications to a company

286
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
or an agency um

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
months afterwards and their reputation

288
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
uh so this is a pretty cool uh graph

289
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
that also just came out recently by

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
checkpoint

291
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
and it looks at the average weekly

292
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
attacks per organization by industry and

293
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
you see that you know we're talking

294
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
right now about purdue university

295
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
education research is really one of the

296
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
top targets

297
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
and the reason that is is because uh you

298
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
know first of all there's a lot of

299
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
networks

300
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
uh various networks departments there's

301
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
a lot of students and visitors that have

302
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
access to things and uh it's very

303
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,079
difficult to to protect so there's a big

304
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,519
effort now being put in a lot of

305
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
universities have been hit with men's

306
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
ransomware and extortion claims over the

307
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,200
last year and then government military

308
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
are always going to be a target usually

309
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,120
by state-sponsored hackers

310
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,640
communications

311
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
healthcare

312
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
has been in the news a lot in the recent

313
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,440
uh

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,839
years since coveted 19 because

315
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,000
most hospitals just didn't have big

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
strong security systems or even plans

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
and and uh hackers use covet 19 as

318
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
excuse to get in

319
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
and uh and extort them a lot of

320
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
ransomware because they need to operate

321
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,839
they can't go down

322
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,000
and that's why it's been

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
considered a national security crisis

324
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
with health care uh and you can look at

325
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
this other slot now i'll leave this

326
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
slide deck behind for for everybody but

327
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
you know pretty much if you look at it

328
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,839
every industry is being hit and a lot of

329
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
them uh uh successfully

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,480
so that's something we need to change

331
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
so what are the cyber

332
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
cyber threat realities

333
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
well this is just a quick chart of who's

334
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,519
who

335
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,880
you know first you have the nation

336
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
states

337
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
their motives are economic or military

338
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
they usually target ip or infrastructure

339
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
uh you see that a lot with utility

340
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,560
plants you've seen it recently with uh

341
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,800
uh the russian hack on uh on ukraine uh

342
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
including their power plants which

343
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,079
happened uh several years before that

344
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,959
too

345
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,800
you see organized crime and financial

346
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
gain and you see them attacking uh

347
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
ip banks

348
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,839
point of sale systems uh huge huge

349
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
amount of money going through there and

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
uh of course that's you know one of the

351
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
big motivators of the non-state actors

352
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
uh terrorist extremists you know they do

353
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
that because they want to be visible and

354
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
get attention

355
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
hackers and activists um they've always

356
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
been out there and they just have fun

357
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,639
hacking things uh that happened with the

358
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,600
twitter

359
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
that can happen with a lot of different

360
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,959
uh leaders a former head of cia's

361
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
account was hacked personal account um

362
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,839
and then again uh trusted insiders you

363
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
know either revenge financial gain and

364
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
they're after your data or network

365
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
information happens a lot in life

366
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
sciences

367
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
in other areas where the ip can be quite

368
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
valuable

369
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
so one area that's really

370
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,839
sort of coming to its own is iot

371
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
internet of things cyber security um

372
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
because every connected device is a

373
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
potential entry point for hackers

374
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,680
and uh you know particularly for a

375
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
critical infrastructure that is is more

376
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
more of a a target a high profile target

377
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
so the uh internet of things devices

378
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
face 5 200 tax a month

379
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
well and everyone in every 36 mobile

380
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
devices has high-risk apps installed on

381
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,480
it according to simmon symantec

382
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
uh from an internet threat report a

383
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
couple years ago

384
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
and uh attackers often they turn their

385
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
iot devices into a bot infect other

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
connected devices so we have an issue

387
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,959
here and i this slide which i developed

388
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
is what i consider the the iot tax

389
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
surface vulnerability slide uh which

390
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
covers some of the key things that you

391
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
might want to remember when you're done

392
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
with iot is that

393
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
uh there's about 50 billion wirelessly

394
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
connected networks of sensors to the

395
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
internet right now

396
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
according to cisco there's others to say

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,279
there's a lot more uh by 2023 there will

398
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,279
be three times more network devices on

399
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
earth than humans

400
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
and by 2025 an average connected person

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,839
anywhere in the world will interact with

402
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
connected devices nearly 4 800 times a

403
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
day

404
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
that's basically one interaction every

405
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,680
uh

406
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
18 seconds

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
so security incidents involving iot

408
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
devices have impacted 67 percent of

409
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
enterprises already that's been

410
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
according to forester which is a very

411
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,160
reputable research group and then 50 of

412
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
iot devices on corporate network

413
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
security organizations then they

414
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
maintain the basic security measures

415
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,360
beyond default passwords

416
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
so uh one of the things that the

417
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
companies usually don't do is when they

418
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
buy something they they leave the same

419
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,880
password on the device and of course

420
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,440
that's easy to to hack

421
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,160
98 of all iot device traffic is also

422
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,639
encrypted exposing personal confidential

423
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
data on the network so uh people often

424
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,320
ask what is the biggest vulnerability

425
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
and i say i usually say iot and supply

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,079
chains and it's just for this this slide

427
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,040
highlights the reason why

428
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
so probably the thing that we fear most

429
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,600
and government fears most and it's

430
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
really been a series of of memorandums

431
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
through opm and the white house recently

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
is critical infrastructure security we

433
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,920
saw uh recently with the colonial

434
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
pipeline what happened when there was a

435
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,959
hack and

436
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
the whole east coast supply line for oil

437
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,720
was taken down which affected food

438
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
prices trucks

439
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
delivering things etc so it shows the

440
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
vulnerability of it and this is because

441
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
of a trend

442
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
called it ot convert convergence ita

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
information technology

444
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
ot is operational technology iot

445
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,959
technology is also part of it um and

446
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
operational technology vulnerabilities

447
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
are increasing year over year largely

448
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,040
because they're based mostly on legacy

449
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
systems

450
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
and so uh

451
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
they pose unique challenges and in ot

452
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,920
when i'm thinking about ot i'm you know

453
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,959
looking to talk about really more about

454
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
scada you're looking at

455
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
utilities you're looking at plants

456
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
you're looking at anything really large

457
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
that involves engines or requires

458
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
anything to you know

459
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,880
to to manufacture something so uh

460
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
the big problem with this is is that

461
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
there's there's a lack of skilled issue

462
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
workforce in those in those areas and ot

463
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
there's just not enough of them trained

464
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
and and perhaps the biggest risk is it

465
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
what may work in cybersecurity it may

466
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,079
pose a risk in ot

467
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
again the colonial pipeline is a good

468
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,000
example of that because you just can't

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,160
turn off the pipeline when you may have

470
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
something corrupted in your i.t side but

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
you're then if you took it off your ot

472
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
side you're you're putting everything

473
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
down

474
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
so a patching is not an option every

475
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,800
time

476
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,839
there's an

477
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
update or disruption you just can't you

478
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,199
can't take it down because it could take

479
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
days to bring it back up

480
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
and also the impacts of a bridge could

481
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,839
be calamitous operational and

482
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
economically uh that's also true with it

483
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,639
though and then and then other problems

484
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
with it is that most organizations don't

485
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,759
even know if attack has occurred or

486
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
lacked the systems to monitor

487
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,959
and detect the breaches and these

488
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,320
control systems i mentioned that they're

489
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
different systems and they're not

490
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
they're not new for the most of them in

491
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
fact most of our grid was built in the

492
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,240
1970s and 1980s so you know when you try

493
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
and uh patch on and bolt down things

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
that you still have unavailabilities

495
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
in the case of energy systems

496
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,800
infrastructure

497
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
um again i mentioned most of them are 25

498
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,279
years old no security built in early

499
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
stages for digital transformation where

500
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
the vulnerabilities are right now and

501
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,639
there that so hackers you know i seek

502
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
out these unsecured ports and systems on

503
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,959
industrial systems and connected to the

504
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
the internet and as i mentioned i've

505
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
teach supply chains that are connected

506
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
to those are particularly vulnerable

507
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
they'll find the easiest way in

508
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,039
so the cyberists gaps and this is for

509
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,720
both it and ot

510
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
are these legacy systems you know you

511
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
have a a lot of databases at a legacy

512
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
too that are not well protected

513
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
silo organizations that don't really

514
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
coordinate cooperate with each other

515
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
reliance on bolted on

516
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
point products

517
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,839
lack of contextual awareness of the

518
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
threats and solutions is still a huge

519
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
problem with most companies they just

520
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,760
don't have the c-suite cyber expertise

521
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
and it's a policy issue they don't know

522
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
the compliance requirements which is a

523
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
legal issue

524
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
and there's also qualified workers uh

525
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
shortages and again you know

526
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
cybersecurity is not just an engineering

527
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,280
or

528
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
an i.t role it really is a role for

529
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
policy it's a role for legislation it's

530
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
a role for law and it's a road to for

531
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,960
anyone to market these products which is

532
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,440
a huge industry right now and uh to

533
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
evangelize these products and solutions

534
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
because it's not going away it's just

535
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
going to get bigger and bigger

536
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
so um

537
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
one thing though that is essential

538
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,559
and and this is not me making this up

539
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,320
this is uh nist

540
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
um is really having a

541
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
a strong

542
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,960
uh

543
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
security framework and and really this

544
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
is just risk management and that's

545
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,160
really quite requirement i think for any

546
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,919
industry you're in but particularly for

547
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
anything to do with security so the risk

548
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
management for the nist put out is

549
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
identify

550
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
success and respond to threats

551
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
and protect detect respond recover so

552
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
those those things are are really

553
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
essential if you're going to approach

554
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
something you have to know where your

555
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
your gaps are what assets you have what

556
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
you want to protect

557
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
uh and if you are

558
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
breached or hacked you know how to

559
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
respond to it do you have an incident

560
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
response plan et cetera so this is the

561
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
first starting point and this uh

562
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
is a public organization uh part of the

563
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
department of commerce and dhs

564
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
and all these is free all you they're

565
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,679
they do it for every vertical in the

566
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,000
industry so you can go and get a how-to

567
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
uh with these these summary framework

568
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
summaries

569
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
and so my own thoughts

570
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
on how we conquer the cyber security

571
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
threats out there as we get more and

572
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
more connected more and more vulnerable

573
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,440
and more and more sophisticated types of

574
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
attacks is we need to really

575
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
do what i call the three pillars

576
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,840
and one is that everything we build now

577
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,760
we need to do by security by design

578
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
which is you build

579
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
agile systems with operational cyber

580
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
fusion to be able to monitor recognize

581
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
respond to emerging threats you need to

582
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,679
install intrusion protection intrusion

583
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
systems monitor malicious activity under

584
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
networks etc

585
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,440
all this is is really critical and it's

586
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
difficult to do after you've already

587
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
built it

588
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
defense in depth which has really been

589
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,559
the primary

590
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
uh i guess mantra for for most companies

591
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,480
and for government over the past few

592
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
years has been you know um you need to

593
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
to look at everything your technologies

594
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
your processes your air gapping your

595
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,039
your hardening of your hardware software

596
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,520
your encryption capabilities of the data

597
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
and your sensors and flow of everything

598
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,799
um

599
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,400
it's difficult because expensive and

600
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,919
most companies just don't have the

601
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,360
resources or understanding how to

602
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,799
orchestrate that

603
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,640
and then what is really now the the more

604
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
of the popular security model which has

605
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
really taken

606
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,760
roots in the last year

607
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
particularly with the

608
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
federal agencies dod intelligence

609
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
committee and dhs is a is a concept

610
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,080
called zero trust and it's really a

611
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
security model that uses strict identity

612
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
verification for every person or entity

613
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
it could be a device attempting to

614
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
access network resources regardless of

615
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
whether the person or entity is in the

616
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
office or outside of it bombed by a

617
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
network perimeter or accessing the

618
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
network remotely basically you just

619
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
don't trust it you have to verify it

620
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,640
first that they should be there and that

621
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,919
you know if they're not then they can't

622
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,039
be part of it

623
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,559
so that's that's integral i think to

624
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,240
everything so uh these security

625
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
strategies are continuing to evolve you

626
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
have to drive strive for a multi-layered

627
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
approach there's there's no one thing

628
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
that you know

629
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
this is a panca for everything so again

630
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
you bake in the security design process

631
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
from the beginning and then you have to

632
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
look at some of the tools and i'll get a

633
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,159
little bit of those i mean you have to

634
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,559
have multi-factor authentication

635
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
nowadays because it's just too easy to

636
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,360
duplicate

637
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,159
uh

638
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
a password or get in through for a very

639
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
simple way uh you need to have a layered

640
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,200
in risk-based access you know who who

641
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
gets what privilege and why uh

642
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
behavioral biometrics you have to look

643
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
at people who are using it what their

644
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,840
uh particular insider threat what

645
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
they're doing

646
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
and now when we get uh ai which we'll go

647
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,159
into a little bit is we have to look at

648
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,320
the anomaly detection you know there's

649
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,799
something wrong in in the network that's

650
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,600
showing up um so emerging technologies

651
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
that automate cybersecurity detection

652
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
response including machine learning

653
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
artificial intelligence and blockchain

654
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
are really coming into those

655
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,400
so

656
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,640
with risk uh

657
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
you have to look at cyber regions not

658
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
aesthetic threat they're always changing

659
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,799
um so again i mentioned that the the

660
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
cyber congress management steps

661
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
uh so one of the things you really want

662
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
to do if you're starting a risk

663
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,440
management plan as you identify and

664
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
classify the assets prepare

665
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
vulnerability assessments confirm the

666
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
security protocols of all the parties in

667
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
your data chain do vulnerability

668
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,600
assessments with penetration tests

669
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,880
really important

670
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
and test incident response plans and

671
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,559
create a cyber resilience plan if you

672
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
just did these six things um you're

673
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
going to be more secure as a company or

674
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,480
as an entity or as a

675
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,760
an individual depending on what you're

676
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,520
doing in career and whether you'll be a

677
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
target but i assume you know everyone's

678
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,280
a target if they're using a credit card

679
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,400
so uh

680
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,799
particularly online so uh this is just

681
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,400
really how to approach risk and that's a

682
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
good slide to keep in mind

683
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
so uh the nuts and

684
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
bolts of this risk managed strategy

685
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
um you know the vulnerability

686
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,400
assessments they need to be installed up

687
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,240
front in the process you map the control

688
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,320
systems communication flows all the

689
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
connected devices in your network you

690
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
need to know where they are

691
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
uh you have to modernize your security

692
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,960
architecture you have to have a policy

693
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,520
for mobile and byod the security bring

694
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
your own device security have incident

695
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,480
response

696
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
you need to have policy which are the

697
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
best practices in compliance uh for your

698
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
industry or in some cases they're

699
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,600
required

700
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,840
uh what you need to do if you're in

701
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
in let's say the the nuclear industry

702
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
you have to follow merck standards uh

703
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
then of course you have to protect your

704
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,880
critical infrastructure through the

705
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
rapid prototyping of technologies and

706
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
uh done through public private

707
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
cooperation because most the critical

708
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,159
infrastructure in the united states

709
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,080
particularly is owned by the private

710
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,880
sector and operated or oversaw not

711
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
really operated but over overseen by the

712
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
governments in state and local and

713
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
federal governments so it's not an easy

714
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,799
endeavor

715
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
so this is just a summary page

716
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,360
if you're interested in cyber security

717
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
is another slide to keep

718
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,000
it really is a quick overview of all the

719
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
requirements you need to look at if

720
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,480
you're going to be uh cyber secure

721
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
and you know i won't go through them all

722
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
but you can look at them right now

723
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,039
they're really

724
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,480
it's not all inclusive they're others

725
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
too but these are the basics you know

726
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,159
and cyber heart security hygiene is the

727
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
most basic is really subsequent

728
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
awareness and passwords and know what

729
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
not to hack on and to know where

730
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,320
everything is so a lot of this is is

731
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
just really common sense but um it

732
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,799
really is uh something that most people

733
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,600
don't follow or know

734
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
and so now i'm going to get second part

735
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
of this in in this uh shorter but it's i

736
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
think it's more exciting

737
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
is that you know all this stuff we're

738
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
doing with cyber security is really

739
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,799
being impacted in our new fourth

740
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,880
industrial revolution you know we're

741
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,080
dealing with a whole

742
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
uh realm of different types of emerging

743
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
technologies

744
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,919
these include automation and adaptive

745
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
networks um artificial intelligence

746
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,279
human computer interface which is really

747
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,840
a fascinating area uh elon musk was

748
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
actually doing some stuff in that area

749
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,679
with neural links and also you know they

750
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
now have ability now for people to who

751
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
are paralyzed and can't speak to

752
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,919
actually communicate through thoughts so

753
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,480
it's fantastic stuff happening and then

754
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,559
there's machine learning which is really

755
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,320
what most people uh it's a part of their

756
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
artificial intelligence most people are

757
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,120
using right now uh with algorithms uh

758
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,279
cryptography and encryption

759
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,039
um you know we're talking about quantum

760
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
resistant uh polymorphic encryptions now

761
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
which are uh cutting edge blockchain

762
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,760
which is a

763
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
relatively new uh

764
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
type of approach technology with uh

765
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
ledgers uh also a way to help secure

766
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,840
things it has limited billing and

767
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
scalability but it's it's

768
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,600
combined with other aspects it's really

769
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,039
important you're seeing a lot of

770
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,960
simulation visual virtualization gaming

771
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
this is also used for training

772
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
uh we're all moving to the edge cloud

773
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
computing edge computing our devices us

774
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
biometrics and authentication technology

775
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
used to be just basic uh

776
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
you know passwords and or maybe even eye

777
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,080
scan but now they they if it's a you

778
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
know your facial recognition or it could

779
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
be even your your heartbeat um

780
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
all kinds of interesting technologies

781
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
and hardware separation hardening

782
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,080
photonics and sensors using photonics to

783
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,960
transmit data uh big data where

784
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
real-time analytics and predictive

785
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,679
analytics goes through artificial

786
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,520
intelligence and how they're storing the

787
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,360
data now with magnetic tapes and even on

788
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
dna and of course

789
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
the big stuff the super computing which

790
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,159
are

791
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
continual race among many universities

792
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,799
and countries to build the strongest

793
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,400
supercomputers and then quantum

794
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
computing which is uh on the horizon not

795
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,440
quite there yet but will revolutionize

796
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
the way we do computing making it

797
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
millions and millions of times faster

798
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,400
so

799
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
of these

800
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
the one that i think are most practical

801
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,200
for cybersecurity at the moment

802
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
are artificial intelligence machine

803
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,480
learning and cyber security

804
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
how they're used threat detection

805
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
you could you could detect spams and

806
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
fishing through them through anomalies

807
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,039
malware identification they match

808
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
uh you know programs you can you draw

809
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
and it matches the malware that you know

810
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,760
that's out there

811
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,600
they autonomously can patch something if

812
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
there's it needs to be patched and

813
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
there's vulnerabilities discovered or

814
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
zero day uh they can categorize what

815
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,919
types of attacks there is in cyber they

816
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,760
can more adapt to evolving risks

817
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
continually update

818
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,360
uh and they're good for both offensive

819
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
and descendants of cyber i mean we could

820
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,679
attack with its

821
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
ai as well as defend with ai and and

822
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
that's uh um interesting because cyber

823
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,480
attackers are already using offensive

824
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
artificial intelligence

825
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,360
to test to sort of self-mutate as it

826
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,279
learns from the environment and hide in

827
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
the background and leverage existing

828
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,159
data flows and

829
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,279
human behavior to remain undetectable

830
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,600
and then eventually attack so you know

831
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,959
there's a it's a two-edged sword

832
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
cloud computing and cyber security cloud

833
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
computing consists of moving and storing

834
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
data and applications over the internet

835
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
and remote servers

836
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
so it's not necessarily in a cloud but

837
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,520
it's another device

838
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
generally it offers users cost

839
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
flexibility mobility and increased

840
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
productivity

841
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
for cyber security allows for good

842
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
firewalling and managed security

843
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
and vantage cloud as you know where the

844
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,000
data resides and who's managing it the

845
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
the the problem also is with the cloud

846
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,000
sometimes it depends who manages your

847
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,919
data which co-mingled with and whether

848
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,840
the data your legacy data is actually

849
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,399
compliant or fits in

850
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,679
and again if you're putting everything

851
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,039
in place even though it might be more

852
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,760
protected it could be also at greater

853
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
risk because if everything is stolen at

854
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
once

855
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
your data is part of it

856
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,320
internet of things as i highlighted a

857
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
little bit earlier idc another great

858
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
research firm predicts that spending in

859
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,200
iot will reach nearly 1.4 trillion

860
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,679
uh from last year this coincides with

861
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
the companies continuing to invest in

862
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,039
iot hardware software services and

863
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
connectivity i mentioned earlier cisco

864
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,320
50 billion devices now connected

865
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
and uh perhaps more even interested in

866
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,919
just the devices themselves or the

867
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,960
sensors uh dr jennings brycek vice

868
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
president of amazon sensing solutions at

869
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,559
fairchild semiconductor

870
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,880
you predict there will be 45 trillion

871
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
network sensors 20 years from now and

872
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,880
they'll be driven by smart systems

873
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
including iot mobile wearable market

874
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
growth digital health context computing

875
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,279
and official intelligence so we're

876
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
really moving into a sensor driven world

877
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
and these sensors also could be inside

878
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,200
of us as chips implants which is

879
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,799
actually being tested and happened in

880
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
some other countries in finland i think

881
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,320
in sweden too that people are actually

882
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,559
putting chips inside their arms

883
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,640
to be able to access computers and do

884
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,480
some of the basic things so i'm not so

885
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,919
sure i'd want to chip inside me but

886
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,760
that's where a lot of the stuff is going

887
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
it's eventually going to that what it's

888
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,399
called uh

889
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,760
augmented human

890
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
and i read about this in some of my

891
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,559
forums articles is that you'll be able

892
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
to you know upgrade intelligence

893
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,399
experiences download

894
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,240
information indirectly into your brain

895
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,120
which is a pretty scary thought

896
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
uh so blockchain

897
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
another one i mentioned a little bit

898
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
earlier it's really a mutable digital

899
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,399
ledger

900
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,720
uh distributed fashion uh you don't have

901
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
a central repository and it's usually

902
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
done without a central authority so it's

903
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,559
it's a basic level it's a community of

904
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
users to record transact in the ledger

905
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,159
that's public that can

906
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,679
can't be changed

907
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,520
so they're good for security because

908
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,480
they keep a record they're really

909
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,240
particularly good for documents

910
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,919
these wills

911
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,559
uh real estate etc but uh there are some

912
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,760
attempts to actually make them more

913
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
scalable

914
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
so that's a quick overview um you know

915
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
feel free to follow me reach out to me

916
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
at uh georgetown or just on linkedin or

917
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
twitter um i have a about seventy seven

918
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
thousand followers on linkedin and i

919
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
post regularly and try to communicate

920
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,039
with many if i can but uh thank you for

921
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,399
having me here

922
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,760
and uh

923
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,000
uh a pleasure talking uh to you and i'd

924
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,919
like to open this up to uh

925
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
to q a

926
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
i'll stop to share

927
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,039
and uh got a couple questions um

928
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,240
could you explain more what cyber

929
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,399
security industries do is all the work

930
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,600
done by writing codes identify recover

931
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,200
um i'll answer that um the answer is no

932
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,720
and i sort of touched on that a little

933
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,600
bit

934
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
cyber security is element of his coders

935
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,960
those are the people that do a lot of

936
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,799
the programming and it's good to have

937
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,880
understanding and background on that but

938
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,200
it's not just the coders it's it's

939
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
pretty much everyone that is involved in

940
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,760
social security from the management uh

941
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
from the people that do uh your

942
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
marketing and sales

943
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,799
from the people that protect all your

944
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
security your

945
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
csos your cio's

946
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,840
it's involved with your lawyers who need

947
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,519
to understand the implications and

948
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,240
liabilities so subscribers really just

949
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
like everything else it's a tool and

950
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,840
technology with thousands of different

951
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,080
types of aspects to it um you know

952
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,519
there's different you know endpoints

953
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
there's there's networks um there's ot

954
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,600
i.t as i mentioned so it's really a

955
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,840
an area that's uh people often look at

956
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
it you know it's just an i.t thing but

957
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,919
it really isn't it's way beyond that so

958
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,519
i encourage everyone to learn more about

959
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,399
it

960
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,159
because it really encompasses everything

961
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
and it also affects every individual and

962
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
company out there

963
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,159
the second thought was a second question

964
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,679
here is what are your thoughts on on

965
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,279
impacts to the cyber ecosystem

966
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,519
uh and things such as log 4j and the

967
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,960
secondary and tertiary effects great

968
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,600
question this is from medina williams

969
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,880
um

970
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,559
i i i think that's a

971
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,279
really a wake-up call

972
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,120
you know that was a zero day that we

973
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
just found that

974
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,159
has implications because you could

975
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,320
connect to anything as a hacker uh

976
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,480
there's a serious effort to

977
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
i think it's not apache but i think it's

978
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,039
a serious effort to try and remedy that

979
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,200
so uh most of the organizations i know

980
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,559
are are

981
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,519
patched it up but if you look at

982
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
history and you look at a few years ago

983
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,919
there was a similar thing with mirai

984
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
which is a malware

985
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,200
that spread out through 120 countries

986
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,360
and a lot of hospitals and education

987
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,399
stuff that we're operating in windows 7

988
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,120
and so everything you know we discover

989
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,840
is

990
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,519
a vulnerability you can use by hackers

991
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,440
if you're not there quick enough it

992
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,039
could cause serious damage and the other

993
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,559
thing is that you know again this is

994
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,080
really where from lessons to solar wind

995
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
is we just don't know most companies

996
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
don't know if there's someone inside

997
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,039
there looking what they're doing right

998
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,840
now

999
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
particularly um

1000
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
you know with threat actors nation

1001
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
states with all the capabilities they

1002
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
bring to the table and be able to do

1003
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,799
stuff and hide um so you know uh it's

1004
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,320
really an imperative to sort of follow

1005
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,080
what's going on what the new threats are

1006
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,120
every day

1007
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
and you hear about them and their people

1008
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
do nothing and do bounty hunting

1009
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,519
to find these these zero days or and

1010
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
then there's organizations that share

1011
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,159
this

1012
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,200
regularly

1013
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,480
so you could be

1014
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
uh to know particularly if you're in a

1015
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
position where you're a cso

1016
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,600
chief information security officer you

1017
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,440
need to know what the threats are what

1018
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,840
the current tactics are and trends to be

1019
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,760
able to defend against them and and also

1020
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,679
nowadays more than ever

1021
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,960
there's a lot more cooperation between

1022
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,679
the government uh and and uh private

1023
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,799
sector to help uh work together to to uh

1024
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,279
to to thwart these these threats

1025
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,960
let me see there's another question here

1026
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,279
okay um

1027
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,360
how can we learn uh

1028
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,640
okay

1029
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,159
how can we learn about cyber security

1030
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,559
will you suggest any online courses

1031
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,399
how is the career path

1032
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,599
you know what uh

1033
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
i do teach at georgetown and we have

1034
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
it's a graduate course and it's in cyber

1035
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
credit risk management

1036
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
um depends

1037
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
what you want to do

1038
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
the people in in my course tend to be

1039
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,359
people that have been working for a few

1040
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
years a lot of them are in government um

1041
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,839
already so they're trying to improve

1042
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,918
their career path but there's a lot of

1043
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,079
ways to get into cyber security and and

1044
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,359
uh you know first is at the

1045
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
undergraduate level at colleges there's

1046
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,480
a lot of courses that can be

1047
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,918
made available

1048
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,440
and take you know just from the basic

1049
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
coding but every every university has

1050
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,399
them and a lot of them have certificate

1051
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,599
programs also you can go to comptia

1052
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
which has these courses online

1053
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
certificate courses if you really want

1054
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,239
to get some of the technical stuff you

1055
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,960
go to a thing called sans and and the

1056
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
other thing is just you know just you

1057
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,639
know go and go on to linkedin and look

1058
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,320
at some of these groups

1059
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
uh information security cyber security

1060
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,760
groups and join them homeland security

1061
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
groups you'll see posts every day uh

1062
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,480
you'll also see who's posting them and

1063
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,079
some of the people maybe people that

1064
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,680
might hire you most companies are

1065
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
looking because there's huge shortage of

1066
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,359
dearth of cyber security practitioners

1067
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,480
so if you get the right qualifications

1068
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,040
um and find that uh that path you want

1069
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
to take um there's there's there's a lot

1070
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,920
of opportunity out there for you

1071
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
okay what are you seeing in regards to

1072
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
trends in cyber insurance

1073
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,599
this is from chuck sackley um

1074
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,839
lawyers of london moved to limit nation

1075
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,240
state attack coverage you know the uh

1076
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
cyber insurance is is a good thing i

1077
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,160
think um but

1078
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,040
they're just not uh it's too early to

1079
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
sort of quantify things and i know it

1080
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
was uh

1081
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,119
adapted by a lot of banks early on

1082
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,960
um but they're finding that a lot of the

1083
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
stuff it's you know

1084
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,000
it has to be comprehensive in terms of

1085
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
your plan and it's the the nitty-gritty

1086
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
that you may not have that makes you

1087
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,800
liable so it's a it's really an evolving

1088
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
area um

1089
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
and the question of whether enough

1090
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
companies will actually go in in the

1091
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,280
pool

1092
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
to make it worthwhile for the insurance

1093
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
companies and whether the insurance

1094
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
companies will be forthcoming and sure

1095
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
enough for the right you know smaller

1096
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
and medium-sized businesses too that

1097
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,200
need it most

1098
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,520
so i'm i'm not i think the jury's out on

1099
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
it i'm a proponent of it but i think it

1100
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,720
needs a lot of evolving

1101
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,880
um how do you think the hybrid work

1102
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,119
culture fueled by the pandemic will

1103
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,040
shape the threat landscape well this is

1104
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
from uh akash

1105
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,000
ravi and uh the answer is it already has

1106
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,040
i mean we've we've actually uh

1107
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,079
gone to a hybrid work force not by our

1108
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,320
choice but because of covet 19.

1109
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
instead of having one office to protect

1110
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
all of a sudden uh

1111
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,760
csos and cios

1112
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,359
found that uh they had to protect

1113
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,960
thousands of offices of employees

1114
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
depending how big the business was and

1115
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,200
this this takes away the the purview of

1116
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,359
a lot of the people protecting it the

1117
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
firewalls etc so i think it's required a

1118
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,720
lot of new tools uh that are being

1119
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,880
enacted it also requires a lot of more

1120
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,560
cyber awareness by employees which is

1121
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
also another

1122
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,520
uh thing that's important to do

1123
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,000
and so i think it's it's a you know it's

1124
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,119
going to continue to be this we're going

1125
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,480
to be in a hybrid world i think for a

1126
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,359
while

1127
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,280
um and uh you know you need to have

1128
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
strong firewalls you need to be or your

1129
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,200
waters are

1130
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,599
strong too that your your information

1131
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,599
data is encrypted all this is really

1132
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520
important so there's a lot of steps you

1133
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,880
can take and i think a lot of companies

1134
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
are quickly adapting to it so i'm pretty

1135
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,079
optimistic that uh the panda pandemic

1136
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,359
may have been actually a wake-up call to

1137
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,200
have us better security in the remote

1138
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,920
workplaces and at home

1139
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,359
so this is from

1140
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,599
marat zamir do you think platforms such

1141
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
as try hackney and hack the box would

1142
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,800
help to guide us throughout our career

1143
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,960
and uh so

1144
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,880
getting a job or internship yeah sure i

1145
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,400
think the more you try and get involved

1146
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
and learn from people

1147
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
um the better it is the more you can do

1148
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,079
um there are a lot of internships

1149
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,680
available out there too so i think you

1150
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,119
know look at government look at state

1151
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,640
and local government too

1152
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,119
uh as well as companies and anytime

1153
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,400
you're you're involved with anything

1154
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,760
you're going to meet people you know

1155
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
that it used to be really if i look at

1156
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,839
my career back it's really networking it

1157
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,760
gets you where you're going and most

1158
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,720
things you never know who you're going

1159
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,760
to meet it's going to introduce your

1160
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,480
next job or your career opportunity

1161
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
and so uh

1162
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,040
absolutely get involved

1163
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,800
how do you think this is from anonymous

1164
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,720
the hack the box is in terms of learning

1165
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,240
about cyber security i think it's good i

1166
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
mean i think you know again cyber

1167
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
security is a learning curve there's so

1168
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,599
much to it and uh

1169
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
if you just get involved in a little way

1170
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,280
you'll you'll want to learn more

1171
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,800
and there's so many different elements

1172
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
out there that you can learn you know

1173
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,480
from from uh in cyber security because

1174
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,800
it's so broad um and there's so many

1175
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,960
elements to it so everything you do is

1176
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
good

1177
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
from your perspective how far are we

1178
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
seeing deep learning frameworks being

1179
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,280
used in cyber security versus mlai uh do

1180
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
you think this could help close the gaps

1181
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,000
this is from fred martinez um you know i

1182
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,079
think we're starting to see it i think

1183
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,720
we're we're primarily uh relying on

1184
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
machine intelligence right now

1185
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
but um

1186
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,720
i am pretty optimistic on on the pace of

1187
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,400
technology how much it's changing and

1188
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,320
the capabilities over the last

1189
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,520
two years

1190
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,359
um there's seems to be so much more

1191
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,760
research and investment going into it

1192
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
and a lot more competition among the

1193
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
private sector too in these companies

1194
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,280
being seen what's being invested in m a

1195
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
so i think we're we're pretty close to

1196
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,480
that and again deep learning frameworks

1197
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
are good you know behavioral is really

1198
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,640
key it's the most difficult thing to uh

1199
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
to anticipate and defend in cyber

1200
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,640
security so uh i think we're gonna see

1201
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,400
some some some major breakthroughs in

1202
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
the next couple years and again i think

1203
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,000
we're on the cusp of a lot of uh

1204
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
interesting technologies that this

1205
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
question is not necessarily having a

1206
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,200
technology it's understanding how to use

1207
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
them and orchestrate them which is

1208
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,279
really going to be the challenge

1209
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,040
so for any more questions

1210
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,000
okay

1211
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
yeah

1212
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,680
uh trunk i think you you mentioned i

1213
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,359
feel you your slides has a lot of

1214
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,880
information and you mentioned that we

1215
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,240
can have your slides so yes yeah so

1216
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,920
maybe i can have a content that you

1217
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
offline and they will ask you maybe send

1218
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,240
the link to your plantation then i can

1219
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,680
post one to

1220
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,920
the sure i'd be happy to

1221
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,520
yeah i think you know usually when i

1222
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
speak i like to use slides for

1223
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,640
cyberspeakers just because there's so

1224
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,440
many

1225
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,359
uh different aspects and statistics that

1226
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,359
are sort of wake-up calls for people

1227
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,839
and then go back to them and use them

1228
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,319
so uh you know it makes it makes a lot

1229
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,520
of sense

1230
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,040
you know rather than it's not death by

1231
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
powerpoint but it's it's really share

1232
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,359
share some uh some interesting facts

1233
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,280
that you can use later on

1234
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,560
chuck thank you very much for the

1235
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,079
presentation and uh next week we will

have your permission now your slides

1238
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,160
next to it and we will be promoting it

1239

appreciate you having me and uh you know

1245
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
trunk there's one more question just

1246
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
comes out last minute would you want to

1247
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
take a look

1248
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,599
oh okay another question okay

1249
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,079
sorry about what we need okay dude

1250
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,800
uh

1251
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
morata

1252
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,680
i don't do bug bonnies but uh i have a

1253
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,119
lot of friends that do

1254
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,040
um people actually do that as a career

1255
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
they make money on it so uh

1256
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,800
you know that's a different part of

1257
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,640
another part of a cyber security i mean

1258
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,240
there's really different like i said

1259
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,359
there's a lot of different elements to

1260
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,079
it but that's yeah i encourage people to

1261
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,160
do that though because it

1262
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,200
you find a lot of the malware that way

1263
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,839
yeah i'm sorry i don't know why i think

1264
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,839
michael disabled my video that's why i

1265
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,400
cannot show my face to you but as joey

1266
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
said you know we are so

1267
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,000
we

1268
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,839
yeah oh yeah awesome they can allow me

1269
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
to start my video now i can say earlier

1270
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
yeah i want to appreciate that actually

1271
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,000
you're coming here to give so exciting

1272
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,680
and talk to you actually young students

1273
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,760
and answer these questions they help

1274
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,240
them a lot and yeah as joey said that we

1275
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,960
are going to post your video and as also

1276
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
as real as your plantation slides and

1277
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,680
the two you know the more people

1278
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,920
yeah great thank you it was a pleasure

1279
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
to be here and thank you for inviting me

1280
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,599
in that and i'll help circulate the

1281
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
social media once you post it

1282
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
awesome thank you very much thank you
