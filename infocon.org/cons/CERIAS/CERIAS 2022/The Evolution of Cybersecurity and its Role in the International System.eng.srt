where competing ideologies of cyber

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
security and this is in line with a

uh to uh to have a few minutes today to

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,439
talk with this particular audience

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
and that the invitation came from spaff

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
as a double honor he really is a legend

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
in the cyber security and national

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,640
security

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
uh community

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
frankly there's nothing i can say that

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
he wouldn't say better and no thought

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,679
that i have that he wouldn't make

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
smarter

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
so i know that i have to be on my best

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
i'm on my very best behavior

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,760
um

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
i want to give a a disclaimer here

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
if i can now and that disclaimer is that

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
although i work for mitre and i'm an

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
adjunct at georgetown and i'm uh

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
uh on the uh i'm the vice chair of the

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
of the board of directors of the space

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,680
information sharing and analysis center

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
everything i say is my opinion others

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
may or may not share these use but they

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,840
are not

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
necessarily the views of anybody for

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
whom i work

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
so

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,080
if you hear something you like that's

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
great and if you hear something you

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
don't like or to which you take

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
objection you may certainly do so but

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
don't blame mitre don't blame the space

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
i sack don't blame georgetown don't

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,680
blame my wife and don't blame our the

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
fish in our aquarium it's all my fault

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
very good

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
now i've had rather an interesting

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
journey

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
um and therefore i cannot and do not

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,400
pitch myself as a professional academic

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
in fact i'm not i've done all sorts of

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,120
things my late mother despaired and i

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,959
think correctly that i would never be

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
able to hold a job and if you take a

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,480
look at this list

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
i started life well after after

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,360
georgetown as an undergrad as a as a cia

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
officer i then went into business i then

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
got called back as a government

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,640
executive in nsa as chief of signals

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
intelligence

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,200
programs

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
uh all in the middle of all of this i

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
became an adjunct professor then i

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
became georgetown

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
then i became a businessman again then i

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
found myself running a couple of cyber

107
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,560
security businesses and then i became

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
the director of a federally funded

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
research development center

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
and then i became a miter tech fellow

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
and now of course i'm with the space

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,040
isac so

113
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,920
um i've had this long rather interesting

114
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,640
zigzag of a journey and my viewpoint is

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
formed by this journey it's not formed

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
by rigorous empirical academic study

117
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
i'm not a grand theorist

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
i do not have

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
i do not pretend that i have an

120
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
empirical method that informs what i'm

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
going to tell you it just seems right to

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
me

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
and that's all i can that's all i can do

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
um

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
what i want to try to do today in the

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
next 30 40 minutes or so

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
um is

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,400
tell you five stories

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
and the five stories to me are sort of

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,040
interesting because they're interrelated

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
and when we talk about cyber security

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,639
today

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
we talk about it as if it's always

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,479
existed or we talk about it as if we all

135
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,120
know what what it is

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
but that's not true cyber security as it

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
exists today is a relatively new concept

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
because it exists in a place that's

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
relatively new called cyberspace

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
and cyberspace itself came into came

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,360
into existence because of a revolution

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
in information technology

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
so all of these things have been

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
happening you know that more or less in

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
parallel a revolution in i.t which

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
created a rev

147
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
the digital cyberspace that we know

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,880
today

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
which created cyber security which is in

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,759
fact got several different and rather

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
interesting and really different

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
definitions

153
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
which has created different concepts in

154
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
the co in different concepts of

155
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
sovereignty the idea of of where a

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
nation state is sovereign and where it's

157
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
not we didn't used to think of

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
cyberspace as a sovereign place and if a

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,880
place that can be sovereign how is it

160
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
going to be governed

161
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
and to get a sense of how all this

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,919
happened

163
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,960
um

164
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
staff is well you're probably a little

165
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
younger than i am but in the course of

166
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,880
one human lifetime

167
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
in the course of my lifetime and not

168
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
just in the course of my lifetime but in

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,479
the course of my professional lifetime

170
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
which is somewhat shorter than my whole

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,199
life

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,840
i've moved from the first information

173
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
technology on which i was formally

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,039
trained

175
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,360
morse code

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,039
to the iphone

177
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,840
in one professional lifetime from morse

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,199
code to the to the iphone think about

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,840
the trajectory and the velocity that

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
took takes place along that trajectory

181
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
now when we talk about cyber security

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,080
and this is sort of a spoiler alert uh

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,479
and i'm sorry about that but i'm not all

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
that sorry about it but it's obligatory

185
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
to say you're sorry sometimes right

186
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
um a lot of people say it's about

187
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
safeguarding information

188
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
some people take a somewhat more

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
expansive view i'm among them and we say

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
it's not just the information but it's

191
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
the systems that process it and then

192
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
there are those people who say it's not

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,080
just that but in a world of iot devices

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
and infrastructures that depend on those

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
systems cyber security is about

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
protecting and safeguarding the

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
infrastructures that depend on the

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,759
computers that process that information

199
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,000
that's what many people think of as

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
cyber security

201
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
and it's a good sort of working you know

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
everyday definition but there are those

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
who say that cyber security is a little

204
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
broader that there's a place called

205
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
cyberspace and it's about gaining the

206
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
outcome you want and not letting

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
somebody else gain an outcome they want

208
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
at your expense

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
and lastly and i think from this

210
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
conversation maybe most important is

211
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,120
that cyberspace

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
is seen by some countries as sovereign

213
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
just like the streets of detroit or the

214
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,560
streets of of

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
of of austin texas or the streets of of

216
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,039
of cape cod

217
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:45,919
and that

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
that cyber security is not about

219
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
protecting information it's about

220
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,639
governing what human beings do in this

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,520
new

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
sovereign space just like a physical

223
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,879
space

224
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
that's very different

225
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
that's very different from talking about

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,599
cyber security as protecting information

227
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
and we're going to talk about how we got

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,240
to the point where these two trains have

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
diverged and parted company

230
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
so we're going to talk about how we made

231
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
this transition

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,240
now when we talk about cyberspace

233
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
we we tend to to to think about cyber

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
security from a very traditional point

235
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,400
of view

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
and from anybody who's been exposed to

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,599
our good friends at the department of

238
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
defense and in the intelligence

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,319
community

240
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,120
we say cyber security can consist of

241
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
three things

242
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,279
computer network defense keeping people

243
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,080
out

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
computer network exploitation getting in

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,640
and stealing information or computer

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
network attack

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,959
uh damaging that information or altering

248
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
it so that it no longer has integrity or

249
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,760
maybe damaging an information system

250
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
which happened with uh with with

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,519
which happened in it with aramco or even

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
damaging an infrastructure that's

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
controlled by information systems like

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
stuxnet

255
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
so you see the terms defense

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
exploitation and attack but i want you

257
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
to forget you're seeing those words and

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
think for a moment about the word

259
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
computer network

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,200
because the concept of cyberspace in

261
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
which we conduct cyber security

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
is important it's important to

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
understand the term computer network

264
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
because the integrated computer network

265
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
of today are the pillars are the

266
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,920
architectural structures that comprise

267
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
cyberspace and they're relatively new

268
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,440
they didn't exist 50 years ago to any

269
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
great extent they're just coming into

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,000
into existence

271
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and just to give you a sense of how fast

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
this was

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,240
we've gone from world war ii which was a

274
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,519
modern war

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,320
land sea air submarines culminating in

276
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
the use of nuclear weapons

277
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,600
with to point to point communications

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,279
all the way to automatic switching

279
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,320
systems to data warehouses to

280
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
virtualization

281
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
to the 5 to 5g

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
internet to the convergence of 5g to

283
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,040
having billions of of internet protocol

284
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,160
addresses

285
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
and throwing off so much information

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
that we're going to use ai to analyze it

287
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
and to manage our infrastructures our

288
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
roads and our our power and our water

289
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
we've done this essentially in the

290
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
period of a human lifetime there are

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
people alive today who are alive in 1945

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,839
and have witnessed all of it and if you

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
think that they've had some you know if

294
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
you think it can be difficult to

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
encompass all of this think about a

296
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,760
human being having to learn an entirely

297
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
new way of operating um in terms of of

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
of communication

299
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
let me talk a little bit more about how

300
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
this came from

301
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,880
when we think about the cyberspace that

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
exists today

303
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
what made it possible where did it come

304
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,320
from well it really got its start you

305
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
know in the 1920s and 1930s with

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
information theory with people who said

307
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
it would be possible to code

308
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
information digitally people like claude

309
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,839
shannon and nice and and nystrom and

310
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
others who developed information theory

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,040
in the concepts of information entropy

312
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
but we didn't have the technology to do

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,839
it

314
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
what happened starting in the 1950s

315
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
accelerating into the 60s 70s and 80s

316
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
was that we developed the technology we

317
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,240
had the theoretical

318
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,839
construct but we didn't know how to do

319
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,640
it we also had to drive costs down and

320
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
we did

321
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
and and we've driven it down today so

322
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
that you can have a device like

323
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
this little iphone here

324
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
that has more processing power than the

325
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
entire world

326
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
possessed in 1945.

327
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
we had to make sure everybody had access

328
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
to it we made it ubiquitous we had to

329
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
make sure things were interoperable so

330
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
that the when when staff

331
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
buys a new printer he can hook it up to

332
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
his network and hook it up to his

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
computer or his iphone or his ipad i

334
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
remember years ago that was hand-to-hand

335
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
combat

336
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
you don't have to go through that now

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
a big thing we had to do and this is one

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
of the most important factors in the

339
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,680
creation of cyber space and therefore

340
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
the creation of cyber security was the

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
unification of information and motion

342
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
and information at rest

343
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
and that sounds sort of esoteric but

344
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
it's let me put it to you this way

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
information in motion is transactional

346
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
information you make a phone call you

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
talk that's information in motion or you

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
send a telegraph

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
while that information is being

350
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
transmitted or an email that's

351
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
information in motion

352
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
information and we learned how to move

353
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
that around

354
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
electronically in this in the in the

355
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
revolutionary war where we had

356
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
telegraphs if you've seen the movie and

357
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,560
i hope you do lincoln during the battle

358
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
of gettysburg in his command center at

359
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
the white house it looks like a modern

360
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
command center right it's wood paneled

361
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
and you have don't have big lcd displays

362
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,600
or big leds but what you do have are

363
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
operator after operator on identical

364
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
carroll sending and receiving

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
information from the battlefield into

366
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,880
the battlefield and advising the

367
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
president

368
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
what they didn't have was a way of

369
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
recording this information digitally in

370
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
a referential database

371
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,959
and the id you know think about it this

372
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
way you go to a bank if you were doing

373
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
this less frequently and you stick your

374
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
card into the atm and there's

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
transactional information in motion it

376
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
reads your card you tell it how much

377
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
money you want to take out it takes that

378
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
information and beats it against the

379
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
referential database how much money does

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,639
staff have here you know if we take that

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,600
money out we decrement that database and

382
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,519
that database is available throughout

383
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,079
the bank's information system we didn't

384
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,480
have the means to do that really until

385
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,680
the late 1950s and early 1960s

386
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,000
the creation of an integrated computer

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
network that could make those two bring

388
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
those two things together

389
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
created the basic building blocks of

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
cyberspace and it didn't exist until

391
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,040
really the late 50s and early 60s and

392
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
there weren't many of them there's one

393
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
other big thing that happened by the way

394
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,639
and i'll raise it just briefly um and

395
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,760
that is

396
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,639
a change in the regulatory environment

397
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,600
prior to the 1980s there was one big

398
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,079
darn phone system in this country and it

399
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,199
was run by mobile or at t

400
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
and their motto of course was let's

401
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
reach out and touch somebody very

402
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
touching mata

403
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
but they were in fact a regulated

404
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
monopoly the us government had agreed

405
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
and settled an anti-trust suit with them

406
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
some 60 years before in which they were

407
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,920
allowed to run as a regulated monopoly

408
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,079
in return for which they would have a

409
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
regulated rate of return and they had to

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
make available some very cheap phone

411
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
service for even poor people in the

412
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,399
country and let the government have

413
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
eminent domain over that network if

414
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,399
there was a national emergency and in

415
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
return for which they built an

416
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,199
interoperable system but that system was

417
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,519
resistant to change it was largely

418
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,639
analog

419
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
most of the time when you made a phone

420
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
call you turned a dial or pushed a

421
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
button which created tones which caused

422
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
a switch

423
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,639
to literally move up and

424
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,639
these are big crossbar switches to

425
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,680
actually

426
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
move by a certain number of impulses or

427
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
a certain number of stops along that

428
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
switch you know if you dialed four six

429
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,959
five nine eight six two you know this

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
thing moved over a fourth you know four

431
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
spaces and then the next switch six

432
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
spaces in the next switch

433
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,959
five spaces and the idea that we would

434
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
need enough bandwidth for video calls a

435
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
t didn't really care for that they said

436
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,440
look we don't see any demand for it in

437
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,839
1982 a company called mci showed up you

438
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,600
may have heard of them certainly your

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
others in your family your parents would

440
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,160
have

441
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
and they wanted to put in place a long

442
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,199
distance communications network for

443
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
truckers in the midwest and they wanted

444
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,440
to lease some of that capability from at

445
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,320
t

446
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
a t said we have a monopoly on this the

447
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
government agreed

448
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
and 18t said and we we've lived up to

449
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,000
that so you know we'll see you in court

450
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
and

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
bill mcgowan running mci at the time

452
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
said you bet you will and he did

453
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
um some of you may remember this he went

454
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,880
to court

455
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
and he said look 18 t's monopoly relies

456
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,279
on them actually producing telecoms at a

457
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
cost so low that competition wouldn't

458
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,920
lower that the marginal cost to the next

459
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
unit of telephony wouldn't go down

460
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,639
if there was competition

461
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
and he said as it happens

462
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,360
i can buy some of their their bandwidth

463
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,000
and resell it at a lower price than

464
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
they're charging the market and i can

465
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
still make a profit

466
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
so clearly they're not selling telephony

467
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
at such a low competitive cost

468
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
judge harold greene brought down his

469
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
gavel i recommend a book called deal of

470
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
the century by stephen cole

471
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
the breakup of a t

472
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
and when he did a t's big black phone

473
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
exploded um the company was broken up

474
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,880
they had to divest the local phone

475
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
companies and allow competition in the

476
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,480
market

477
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
that competition

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
began to fulfill the

479
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,439
so the the heretofore unsatisfied demand

480
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
for digital services and that's another

481
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
reason why

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,520
although the technology was existed

483
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,119
there had been a roadblock to its

484
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
adoption

485
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,400
and that's not a story that people tend

486
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
to tell because it's not a story

487
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,400
principally about technology it's a

488
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
story about human competition

489
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,039
now

490
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,600
some aspects of cyber security in terms

491
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
of just intercepting and safeguarding

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,960
communications have agreed for have been

493
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
around for a long long time

494
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
for example we used electronic

495
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
communications during the us civil uh

496
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
u.s civil war and it was that you know

497
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
that plus the plus the north's

498
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
enormously bigger population and

499
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
industrial capacity helped them to win

500
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
they were not only able to send their

501
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
forces by railroad from one front to the

502
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,919
other but they had a network of

503
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,640
telephony of communications

504
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
that allowed information to flow

505
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
and at best you might try to chop down

506
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
some of those cables or intercept them

507
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,679
or break the simple codes at the time

508
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,080
but this really wasn't cyber security as

509
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
we practice it today

510
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,160
in world war one things got a little

511
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
more sophisticated codes got a little

512
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
better there was a lot more

513
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,679
communication taking place

514
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,360
the term hacking

515
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
reportedly and this is an apocryphal

516
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
story may not be true

517
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
comes from according to the story

518
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,720
british frog men who swam ashore and cut

519
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
the the cables the germans were using to

520
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
communicate with their embassies

521
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
overseas and they cut them by using

522
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
hatchets they hacked through them

523
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
world war ii saw the first efforts to

524
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
start to build really integrated

525
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
information systems but those efforts

526
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
were hobbled because we didn't have the

527
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,200
digital technology necessary to actually

528
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
unify information and motion and

529
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
information at rest so you might have

530
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
operators saying we're tracking this

531
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
plane on radar we're tracking you know

532
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,600
the british are coming to bomb britain

533
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,919
or the british or or the americans are

534
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,240
going to bomb berlin and people were

535
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
seeing this and taking that information

536
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
and writing it down on big transparent

537
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
boards with grease pencils that was the

538
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
information at rest

539
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
and as long as there wasn't too much

540
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
information you could actually process

541
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
that information in something close to

542
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
real time

543
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
but that wouldn't happen and i'm going

544
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
to tell you what what what the challenge

545
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,160
was

546
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
by the way in the second world war

547
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
germany thought that their cyber

548
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
security was pretty darn good they had a

549
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
machine called enigma you've probably

550
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
heard of it their ability to communicate

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,440
securely meant that they could send

552
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,840
their submarines after american after

553
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,760
allied convoys we didn't know where they

554
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,720
were

555
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,799
but we did learn how to break it and by

556
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,760
the way

557
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
right within six months of pearl harbor

558
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
we had midway because in part we broke

559
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
some of the japanese codes

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
which changed the course of the war so

561
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,960
interest in code breaking

562
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
not necessarily cyber security as we

563
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
practice it today is not new

564
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
by the way this is how the british

565
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,080
attacked the german codes they came up

566
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
with a bunch of logic tests they said

567
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
yes but this is still a hard problem so

568
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
let's make it easier and they studied

569
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,559
what the germans were doing and they

570
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
realized you know everybody makes

571
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
mistakes if the if the germans are using

572
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
this machine you know they may make

573
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
mistakes if we were using it we would

574
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,120
what would we make mistakes and they

575
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,480
found out that the germans were

576
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
repeating some settings that they should

577
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
have changed each day

578
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
including the three letters at the

579
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,919
beginning of each day's transmission

580
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
they should have changed it every day

581
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
some operators use their girlfriend's

582
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,159
name

583
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
they kept it one operator's girlfriend's

584
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
name was celia that became known as an

585
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,559
operator's seal and they would keep it

586
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
and so the the british began to reduce

587
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
somewhat the number of possible settings

588
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
of that machine but that having made the

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,679
problem a little easier it was still

590
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
hard so they said now that we know a

591
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
little more about it and we have the

592
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
means to guess it let's industrialize

593
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,159
the process of intelligent guessing and

594
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,159
they produced a guessing machine a big

595
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
mechanical machine called the bomb and

596
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
then they produced a few hundred of them

597
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
and a few thousand of them and in

598
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
essence they

599
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,480
industrialized the uh the concept of

600
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
making guesses something the germans

601
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
never thought would happen

602
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
um at the end of the war by the way a

603
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
version of this machine as an actual

604
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,200
programmable computer was created this

605
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
was what the british created to go after

606
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
the germans 12 rotor enigma machine the

607
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,559
machine used by hitler to communicate

608
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,640
with his principal i mean his principal

609
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,159
subordinates

610
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,720
and this machine which had an ingress

611
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
which had a rate of of data ingress of

612
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
50 kilobits in 1945 which was pretty

613
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,799
amazing

614
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
when you think about the dial-up modem

615
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
some of us put to sleep 20 years ago

616
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,799
that had 56 kilobits this machine has

617
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,720
been recreated and it's the story goes

618
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,440
that it cracked the the german cipher

619
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
hitler cipher the first time it was used

620
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
quite a machine

621
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
we were also trying to protect

622
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
information

623
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
this is how roosevelt and churchill talk

624
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,559
to each other roosevelt would speak his

625
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
voice was coded with analog technology

626
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
and pulse width modulation

627
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
the sound of mercury vapor lamps

628
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
sparking and arcing and hissing was

629
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
recorded on records you can see them in

630
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
this picture

631
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
um as his voice as he spoke his voice

632
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
was coded in modulo arithmetic the sound

633
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
of the record was coded in modulo

634
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,840
arithmetic those noises were added

635
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
together and transmitted by high

636
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,240
frequency radio over the atlantic an

637
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
identical record playing at the

638
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
identical speed with some kind of

639
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,240
out-of-band synchronization without any

640
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
digital technology

641
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
was playing on the other end and that

642
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
modulo arithmetic stream of that record

643
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
that mercury lamp uh arcing and sparking

644
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
and hissing was subtracted and from that

645
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
emerged

646
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
roosevelt's voice this took rooms of

647
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
equipment it wasn't cheap it wasn't

648
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,120
interoperable it wasn't digital it

649
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
shouldn't have worked at all it worked

650
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,799
actually quite well and the germans were

651
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
never able to figure out what it was and

652
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
intercept and break any of roosevelt and

653
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
churchill's communications

654
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
however they both spoke their own form

655
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
of english which probably led to its own

656
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
kind of coded miscommunication

657
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
these systems weren't cheap

658
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
they weren't ubiquitous they weren't

659
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
digital and they did not process

660
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
information at rest

661
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,760
didn't do it

662
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
where did all that come from

663
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
it started in the 1950s

664
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
when we began to come up with a

665
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
high-speed interoperable digital

666
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,480
communications that could create a

667
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,880
modern computer network and we didn't

668
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
have cyberspace until we did this

669
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,360
we came up with a

670
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,760
a very unsexy name called the

671
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
semi-automatic ground environment this

672
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
being washington we had to come up with

673
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,679
a name that would be so boring no one

674
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
would pay the slightest attention to it

675
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,159
and if somebody said hey we have you

676
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,840
know if you asked your spy do they have

677
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,279
information yeah i have something about

678
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,440
the ground environment it's like well go

679
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
get something important but this was

680
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,279
actually built to automate the air

681
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,919
defense of north america and it was

682
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,159
important because we had to be able to

683
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
keep adversaries from ex from exploiting

684
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,880
it getting into it and disrupting it and

685
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
it was really important because for the

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,840
first time we were able in one digital

687
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
environment to combine information and

688
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,880
motion and information at rest

689
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,799
here's what it looked like

690
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
now

691
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
i'm really sorry that it's my my my

692
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
graphics are not better and i'm not

693
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,200
quite the powerpoint ninja that some of

694
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
you are probably used to but i want you

695
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
to think about this a little bit as if

696
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,960
you were using waze or google maps and

697
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
notice that the two images are

698
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,200
conceptually pretty much the same

699
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
um waze a picture a screenshot of which

700
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,400
here is of course uh

701
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
in color it's it's it's not monochrome

702
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
where is where is

703
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,159
sage was but let me tell you what a sage

704
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,919
operator would see

705
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,159
they would see a digital map

706
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,640
in other words they would see a visual

707
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
representation

708
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
a visual representation of

709
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
a database and on that database were

710
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
points that had the names of places and

711
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,120
the resources malestrom air force base

712
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,039
and what units were there and how many

713
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
people were in this city and if that

714
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
information was changed it would be

715
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,520
changed in that database and changed in

716
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
the representation on this map

717
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
the other thing you would see on this

718
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
map is things that were moving around

719
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,840
representing information and motion and

720
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
that information in motion would be

721
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,080
soviet bombers and missiles moving at

722
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles

723
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
an hour

724
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
and american bombers and american

725
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
fighter planes firing their own missiles

726
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,279
moving at thousands of miles an hour now

727
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,799
ask yourself how you would have handled

728
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,600
this in a world of of uh

729
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,840
of information at rest

730
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
you know if you were an operator right

731
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,320
you couldn't possibly put this on a a

732
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
transparent board with a grease pencil

733
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
and somebody says all right the soviet

734
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
fighter plane is over here no they're

735
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
over here you know this plane is moving

736
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,480
at 1200 miles an hour or some missile is

737
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
coming over and it's moving at three or

738
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
four thousand miles an hour

739
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,159
you couldn't possibly

740
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,880
keep up with that information in motion

741
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
and create a physical database with your

742
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,159
pen and pencil on a paper or on a

743
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,120
or on a

744
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
plastic board no you needed to have a

745
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,440
referential database and this was as

746
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,760
much as anything else really the world's

747
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,799
first

748
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,159
large-scale integrated computer network

749
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
that unified information and motion with

750
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
information at rest and this really was

751
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
the first building block of the thing

752
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,039
that we today call cyberspace

753
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,440
cyberspace didn't exist until this

754
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,520
science this thing and the things that

755
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
followed it started to exist

756
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
things moved pretty quickly after that

757
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the defense advanced research project

758
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
agency said well let's build a network

759
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,399
using this kind of technology and they

760
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,480
came up with an interoperable protocol

761
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
for communications called the

762
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
telecommunications protocol internet

763
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,440
protocol tcp it's still in use we had

764
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,799
four nodes connected by 1969

765
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,000
by 1973 we actually hooked up europe and

766
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,360
this technology this architecture of

767
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,039
interoperability

768
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,679
pioneered here became sort of the

769
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,559
foundation of what was arpanet and

770
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,360
arpanet's architecture is what we know

771
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,720
today essentially as the internet and

772
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
it's not just communication but it's a

773
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,039
network that connects information that

774
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,200
are the information that's processed

775
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,000
both in motion and at rest and this

776
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
moved very very quickly

777
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
these kinds of architectures were either

778
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,159
deployed publicly or deployed within

779
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
behind the firewall as it were or behind

780
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,760
the fence line

781
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,520
for the defense department and other

782
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
sensitive organizations and it became so

783
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,679
ubiquitous that the department of

784
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,159
defense didn't have to run it anymore

785
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,799
and therefore it was finally retired as

786
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
the internet itself went public

787
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,520
vint cerf of google one of the inventors

788
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,279
of all of this said

789
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,600
it was the first and being first was

790
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,880
best but now we lay it down to ever rest

791
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
now pause with me a moment shed some

792
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
tears for old langzine for love for

793
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,159
years and years of faithful service

794
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,279
duty done i weep lay down they pack it

795
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
now oh friend and sleep

796
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,159
and as the arpanet was put was

797
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,640
essentially retired the internet was

798
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,080
born and cyberspace expanded enormously

799
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,279
now

800
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,039
a key point here

801
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
the creation of cyberspace was the

802
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,360
transition from communications to

803
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
integrated communication computer

804
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,159
networks and these networks really are

805
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,399
the call the goal the

806
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,960
the core of today's global cyberspace

807
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,480
environment

808
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,520
now

809
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
one of the questions one has to ask is

810
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,480
how big is cyberspace and is it a really

811
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,240
a human domain

812
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,480
um there is a famous capitalist

813
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,799
philosopher named vladimir lenin you may

814
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,399
have heard of him

815
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,120
and he had a phrase he once said

816
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,559
quantity has equality all its own so

817
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,760
cyberspace i think of really is a domain

818
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
we used to have a few hundred people or

819
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
a few thousand people connected by

820
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
telegraphs when the titanic sank the

821
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,840
people on that ship were served

822
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,120
essentially by one telegraphic link

823
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,799
we have about 7.5 now about 7.6 billion

824
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,320
people on earth

825
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
some tens of millions are on the ocean

826
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,520
at any different times in 2017 the last

827
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
year for which i have data we had about

828
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
a billion airline passengers in the

829
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,000
world

830
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
and you know we have maybe 10 or so

831
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
people up in space in any given moment

832
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
although elon musk and jeff bezos are

833
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,200
doing

834
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
whatever they can to get people to get

835
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
more people up there and if you have a

836
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
few dollars of your own you can you can

837
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
you can and the doctor's waiver you can

838
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,159
buy a ticket

839
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
how many people are in cyberspace

840
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,399
well here's some information that comes

841
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,799
out of 2017.

842
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,720
and it's interesting here because it not

843
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
only shows the country's population of

844
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,399
the time but the number of people

845
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,840
connected that's the internet

846
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,720
penetration rate and how much that rate

847
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
grew from the year 2000 of the year

848
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,960
2017.

849
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,559
china which started essentially at zero

850
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,000
had by 2017 almost seven seven hundred

851
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,679
fifty seven hundred forty thousand

852
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,919
people online

853
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,720
or almo over three thousand percent rate

854
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
of growth from 2007 to 2000 to 2017.

855
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
the united states had about 200 growth

856
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,440
because we started we had more people

857
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,640
online

858
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,559
but you should note that china now has

859
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
more people online than we have people

860
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,279
into by the by the middle of 2017 more

861
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,880
than half of the people in the world

862
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,200
were connected more than half the people

863
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
in the world connected

864
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,399
and a year later

865
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,279
it was 55

866
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,399
now what i'm trying to do here is to

867
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,000
draw out for you

868
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,679
the the the different experience that we

869
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,919
had in coming online

870
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,559
and china had in coming online and that

871
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,279
difference shapes in my opinion to a

872
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,960
very large extent

873
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
that experience how we view

874
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
cybersecurity cyberspace and

875
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,000
cybersecurity and how they view it

876
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,279
our

877
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
accession into cyberspace was relatively

878
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,679
slow

879
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,320
i mean was was relatively slow right

880
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,559
about 200 percent from 2000 to 2017.

881
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,600
china moved from essentially nobody to

882
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,799
almost 740 000 people in 17 years

883
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,200
in other words we experience cyber we

884
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
experience the development of cyberspace

885
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,519
through the incremental advance of

886
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
technology

887
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
they experience cyberspace through a

888
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,640
wave of human beings coming online

889
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
so many human beings that they have more

890
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
human beings online than we have human

891
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,519
beings in our country

892
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,480
here's another way of looking at it

893
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
united states has a population today of

894
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,919
about 328 million people

895
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,960
china had as many people online as we

896
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,399
have people

897
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,639
in 2009.

898
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,640
by 2008

899
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,960
they had about 800 million today they

900
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
have about a billion people

901
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,360
or roughly three times as many people

902
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,720
online out of 1.4 billion people than we

903
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,960
have in the united states we have about

904
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,519
328 million people most but not all are

905
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,760
online they have about a billion people

906
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,039
online so their experience in cyberspace

907
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,480
is very different

908
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,720
and we experience cyberspace in the

909
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,279
context of a global commons as a liberal

910
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,799
democracy

911
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,200
they've experienced their wave of human

912
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,919
beings coming online in the context of

913
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,960
an authoritarian ideology which is very

914
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,679
different which requires a closer

915
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,600
supervision and level of governance of

916
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,559
human beings and all of a sudden look

917
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
there's a new place where human beings

918
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,320
exist what are we going to do about that

919
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
now we're not by the way the only

920
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,399
countries that have our own view

921
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,720
iran is learning to master cyberspace

922
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,480
technologies and they're very much like

923
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
china

924
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,519
our friends in the democratic people's

925
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,399
republic of of korea or also known as

926
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,559
north korea you know they're also

927
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,960
becoming effective in the use of cyber

928
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
security tools

929
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,000
there are actually attempts underway and

930
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
a fairly complex calculation that i'm

931
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,918
sure you engineers will master by the

932
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,960
time this this this meeting is over

933
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,560
in which countries are in which we're

934
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
actually trying to figure out which

935
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
countries have mastered the ability to

936
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,119
exercise cyber security to exercise

937
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
influence in cyberspace

938
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
these are the factors that the belfor

939
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
center at harvard thinks of as important

940
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,119
since well i think i'm going to leave

941
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,879
you with these slides i won't try to go

942
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,320
through all of it and besides which i

943
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
want to leave a time a little time for

944
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,679
for q a

945
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,159
but based on this calculus they've said

946
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,000
that the united states has the most

947
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,359
capability

948
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,918
but the country that has the most highly

949
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,079
integrated doctrine and concepts for

950
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,480
using capability is china

951
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,960
this is an interesting list your own

952
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,359
results may be different

953
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,359
and it's already probably about a year

954
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,200
year and a half out of date

955
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
but it provides an interesting pic

956
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,760
snapshot of the capability that

957
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,119
countries have

958
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
what it doesn't tell you

959
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,240
is how countries look at cyberspace and

960
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
what's interesting here is that china

961
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
has a very integrated view

962
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,359
of cyberspace and the use of power in

963
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,920
cyberspace that may be stronger than

964
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,680
ours why

965
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,839
well let's go back to this picture with

966
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,920
a billion people in cyberspace they

967
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,240
probably need the means in their own

968
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,480
minds to figure out how cyberspace

969
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,079
governance which for them is

970
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,040
cybersecurity takes place

971
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
so for us

972
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
cyberspace evolved as an electromagnetic

973
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,079
domain it was driven by technology it

974
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
was built by information and integrated

975
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,480
computer networks and these networks

976
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,200
serve us as a liberal democracy

977
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
for other countries for authoritarian

978
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,400
countries

979
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
cyberspace evolved more quickly and it

980
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,359
evolved inside with such numbers that

981
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,040
their people live there and they are

982
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
sought and they seek to govern them

983
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
there that's a very different way of

984
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
looking at it i'm going to jump through

985
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
this for a second and go to uh and go to

986
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,560
another way of looking at this

987
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,640
china russia and several other countries

988
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
have signed a thing called the shanghai

989
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,560
cooperation accord

990
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
this is how they define

991
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
cyber security

992
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,119
it's protection against the distribution

993
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,599
of information harmful to political and

994
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,800
social and economic systems

995
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,119
do you see anything here about the

996
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
protection of information

997
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,200
it's about the protection against

998
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
information it's about how people are

999
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
governed how people behave

1000
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
this is where cyber security has gone

1001
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,440
for authoritarian countries and this is

1002
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
very different because what it means is

1003
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,880
for the global

1004
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,599
cyber security domain some countries see

1005
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,839
it as we do a global commons for free

1006
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,640
expression and other countries see it as

1007
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
a domain that can be made sovereign to

1008
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,920
them

1009
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
let me

1010
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,839
bring this sort of on let me let me sort

1011
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
of bring around and make it a little

1012
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,200
more tangible

1013
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,680
you can see that chinese researchers

1014
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,520
have started to talk about cyber

1015
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,640
territory and defending cyber

1016
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
sovereignty

1017
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,160
you're seeing china's approach described

1018
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,560
as quote a state-centric model of

1019
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,119
internet governance it favors the

1020
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,599
authority of the nation-state over its

1021
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,680
netizen

1022
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,560
so

1023
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
there are other ways of looking at this

1024
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
my friend joe nye staff i think you

1025
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,200
probably know joe very well

1026
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,359
upper columbia says that

1027
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,920
the evolution of cyberspace also ought

1028
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,560
to be viewed in different levels there's

1029
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,320
the level at which the united states is

1030
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,560
still probably the most powerful country

1031
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
and probably will remain that way the

1032
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
use of information technology for

1033
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,040
command for control for intelligence for

1034
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,480
war making

1035
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
but at the second level on mr spock's

1036
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
three levels chessboard for those who

1037
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
remember it information technology isn't

1038
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,440
just used for

1039
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,000
military power it's used in a

1040
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
multi-polar world of commerce and the

1041
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
barriers to entry

1042
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
for using advanced information

1043
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,640
technology are easily surmounted by

1044
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
middle range powers and therefore it's

1045
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,040
not just the united states it's the u.s

1046
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,640
it's china

1047
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,000
japan the european union india

1048
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
russia although the situation in russia

1049
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,599
is clearly

1050
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,280
very unsettled

1051
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,040
the third level

1052
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,359
is where i t connects everybody because

1053
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,680
it's cheap and ubiquitous no one's

1054
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,760
dominant there are very few barriers to

1055
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,480
entry we now have close to 60 percent of

1056
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,400
the world's people are online it

1057
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,880
connects parties and churches religious

1058
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,359
affiliations social groups ideologies

1059
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,880
constituencies

1060
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
hobbyists

1061
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
and to be successful there

1062
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,400
it's not having the most powerful

1063
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,839
information technology it's what it's

1064
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,560
who has the best story and you're seeing

1065
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,720
this played out you're seeing in

1066
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,119
attempts to govern cyberspace which is

1067
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,920
another definition of cyber security now

1068
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,400
it's not just based on the technology

1069
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,640
it's the use of social media and other

1070
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,000
tools to create a story that sells and

1071
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
what joe nye has said is that the united

1072
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
states was slow to recognize that the

1073
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
second and third levels even existed and

1074
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
that what happened at the third level

1075
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,240
could actually be important if not

1076
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,720
decisive and we were slow to realize

1077
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,040
that i think nye is correct

1078
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,200
so

1079
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,079
in my turn in my view you know it's the

1080
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
term cyber security which we used to

1081
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,640
call computer network exploitation

1082
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
defense computer network exploitation

1083
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
and computer network attack

1084
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,359
is really now i would call it computer

1085
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,839
network control i would say it's not

1086
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,000
just doing it's not just

1087
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
defending or attacking it's constantly

1088
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
defending constantly exploiting

1089
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,839
constantly attacking it's essentially

1090
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,839
gaining as much influence as you can in

1091
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,280
cyberspace so that you are protecting

1092
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
your interests it's not just i kept you

1093
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
out of my firewall or i got into yours

1094
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,640
it's

1095
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
it's a constant ebb and flow of

1096
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,520
influence so in my view the next term

1097
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,400
for cyber security might well be called

1098
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
computer network

1099
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,839
control

1100
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,599
i'm going to wrap this up

1101
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,200
with a picture

1102
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,680
too and open it up for for q a assuming

1103
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,520
any of you are still awake and have

1104
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
found any of this interesting

1105
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
we experienced cyberspace in the west

1106
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,200
essentially as an electromagnetic domain

1107
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,359
and even today if you take a look at the

1108
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,079
controversy over the irnit bill that's

1109
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,119
in congress that has bipartisan support

1110
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
there are civil libertarians who say

1111
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
that it would allow too much government

1112
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,680
government intrusion and

1113
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
and and governance

1114
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
in cyber space and there's a very

1115
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,240
healthy in my view debate underway about

1116
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
that bill and about the level of

1117
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
governance government would provide

1118
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,800
for china and other countries cyberspace

1119
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,119
is where you govern human behavior you

1120
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,760
watch people there you you engage in

1121
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,359
persistent surveillance you use

1122
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,520
artificial intelligence to make

1123
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
decisions about the value of their

1124
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
behavior and you give them a good or a

1125
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,359
not so good ticket on the next plane

1126
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,960
that they want to fly or whether or not

1127
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,920
they get to travel um and they look at

1128
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,720
this as they look at at cyber security

1129
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,480
as an ideology now how is this being

1130
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,839
expressed

1131
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,240
china is trying to build as much as

1132
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,160
possible the next generation of the

1133
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,079
world's information technology

1134
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,359
infrastructure

1135
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,839
that is the next generation of all of

1136
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,319
the all of the integrated computer

1137
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,440
networks that will comprise the internet

1138
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
of the future and their company huawei

1139
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
is the largest and fairly and frankly

1140
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,880
cheapest provider of this technology

1141
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,720
they are building out a global

1142
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,880
infrastructure scheme called one belt

1143
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,680
one road or the belton road initiative

1144
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
and along that they want to build out a

1145
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,280
digital silk road

1146
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,200
equipped with their information

1147
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,599
technology and the question is this

1148
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,920
if they build it and these countries

1149
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,640
adopt not only china's information

1150
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,119
technology but their ideology what

1151
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,880
happens to the cyberspace in these

1152
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,560
countries or

1153
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
if they outsource to china the

1154
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,200
management of these infrastructures who

1155
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
then becomes the sovereign in these

1156
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,040
countries what would happen if this

1157
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,960
model were extended to our doorstep

1158
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,040
that's an interesting question

1159
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,960
this is a somewhat dated picture from

1160
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,880
the magazine the economist as to where

1161
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
they're building one belt one road

1162
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,119
you'll notice by the way it what it

1163
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,720
doesn't show is that there are aspects

1164
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,200
of this now in latin america

1165
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,160
and

1166
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,800
as you can see there they have nodes all

1167
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
over include all over

1168
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
all over europe and all over africa and

1169
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,520
all over asia going into going into

1170
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,839
western europe

1171
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,800
and what goes on this digital silk road

1172
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,720
well let me give you a picture of it

1173
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,680
this is a smart city

1174
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,640
architecture developed by alibaba

1175
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,599
again

1176
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,280
i think they may have updated this but

1177
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
let me without

1178
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
making you all take a an unwelcome

1179
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,319
and unexpected eye exam let me guide you

1180
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,400
through the top line of this thing

1181
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
on the left are all the places where the

1182
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000
data comes from

1183
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
imaging devices sensor devices network

1184
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,760
data

1185
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,440
devices on the road looking at the

1186
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,839
number of cars devices on trams and

1187
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,760
subways looking at speed

1188
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,720
and congestion uh devices in the in the

1189
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,240
pipes so that you know what the water

1190
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,319
flow is devices that tell you how many

1191
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,000
police are deployed

1192
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that data goes to the middle where it's

1193
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,720
converged in the applications below

1194
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,040
using machine learning to habituate it

1195
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
to the system to that and spot patterns

1196
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,839
in in that data and artificial

1197
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,480
intelligence to actually make decisions

1198
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,839
on that data

1199
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,920
that those decisions are expressed in

1200
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,000
the infrastructure on the right medical

1201
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,480
resources administrative resources power

1202
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,680
resources

1203
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
policing resources how many people how

1204
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,359
many police to deploy to this part of

1205
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,440
the region or that part of the region

1206
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
road resources and rail resources

1207
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,200
let me ask you a question if all that

1208
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,160
data is being accrued and decisions are

1209
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,839
being made about the deployment of

1210
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,760
everything from electricity to police

1211
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,920
neighborhood by neighborhood who runs

1212
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,960
this city who's sovereign and if this

1213
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,200
kind of infrastructure is being placed

1214
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,880
on this kind of a map

1215
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,359
this is a different kind of cyberspace

1216
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,280
that's emerging and a different kind of

1217
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
cyber security this i think is

1218
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,119
interesting

1219
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,079
so

1220
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,680
where are we now and i'm going to wrap

1221
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,920
up and leave us with some questions

1222
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,960
we you know we're we were initially

1223
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,359
connected in cyberspace

1224
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,160
that's how we were we connected

1225
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,079
you know we and still a lot of people

1226
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,079
look at cyberspace as a connection

1227
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,800
increasingly we depend on it now we

1228
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,960
depend on it for banking for paying our

1229
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,119
bills for social networks and social

1230
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,880
media and making restaurant

1231
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,319
recommendations

1232
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,440
reservations and ordering from grubhub

1233
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,319
but interest in increasingly as we move

1234
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,640
to a world like this and we're building

1235
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,400
smart cities in the united states and

1236
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
europe too by the way we are not just

1237
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,359
going to depend on cyberspace we and our

1238
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,000
infrastructures will reside there and

1239
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,839
that means that inevitably cyber

1240
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,359
security won't just be about the

1241
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,760
protection of information it won't just

1242
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,040
be about the protection of the

1243
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,520
infrastructure it'll be about what model

1244
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,920
of governance that we choose

1245
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,319
cyber security and these dueling models

1246
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,079
have become an aspect of great power

1247
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,240
competition particularly between the

1248
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,480
united states and china

1249
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,720
great powers are using this to gain

1250
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,240
sovereignty and control over

1251
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,440
infrastructures as well as to use joseph

1252
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,240
nye's third level on the chessboard to

1253
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,720
influence and undermine competitors and

1254
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,480
tell the best story

1255
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,960
that's happening today

1256
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,280
so for the united states we continue to

1257
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,119
see it as this domain

1258
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,520
for authoritarian countries really is

1259
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,480
about the governance of human behavior

1260
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,880
i think we've got a little bit of time

1261
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
for q a so i'm going to stop at this

1262
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,440
point i can elaborate on some of these

1263
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,119
points of view but at this point i think

1264
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,440
i'd like to move over to q a

1265
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,760
so staff if you agree i'm going to stop

1266
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,480
presenting and open this up i see that

1267
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,880
we're already getting the first question

1268
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,680
staff are we in good shape for this we

1269
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,359
are so

1270
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,440
um do you want to just uh

1271
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,119
answer the questions that are in q a

1272
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,000
there all right i will see

1273
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
so anonymous

1274
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,160
ah

1275
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
i read that anonymous all right well you

1276
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,760
can be anonymous although i don't know

1277
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,520
why you want to be i read that

1278
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,599
innovators need to consider cyber

1279
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,040
security at the heart of their

1280
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,400
innovations

1281
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
most of the innovations created end up

1282
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,480
being introduced in other countries

1283
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,599
however

1284
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
however how people choose to use

1285
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,119
technologies differs from person to

1286
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,079
person

1287
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,680
what direction do you think we should be

1288
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,440
looking at to ensure that the negatives

1289
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
of technological advancements don't

1290
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,240
outweigh the good

1291
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,079
well let me answer

1292
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,119
assuming you can hear me um

1293
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,000
there is no perfect assurance that a

1294
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,400
technology will be used for good and not

1295
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,040
for for for ill

1296
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,079
i go back in my mind to the years 2010

1297
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,280
2011 when we had the arab spring

1298
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,160
and many said aha look at the egyptians

1299
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,319
they're using information technology to

1300
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,760
coordinate the crowds to

1301
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,400
rise up in in opposition to the

1302
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,720
government to get the crowds into tahrir

1303
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,599
square

1304
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,319
the government of egypt was at the time

1305
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,240
not very agile they barely knew that

1306
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,559
cyberspace existed if a government

1307
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,040
minister wanted a restaurant reservation

1308
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,960
they sent some flunky in the office over

1309
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,240
to the restaurant to make that

1310
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,920
reservation and let him know that he and

1311
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
his family would be there for for

1312
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,280
however long they were going to be there

1313
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,880
that's what happened they didn't use

1314
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
cyberspace

1315
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,480
but people in egypt were using it to

1316
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,240
manage their families and their small

1317
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,880
businesses and remittances and cyber

1318
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
security cyberspace was being used in

1319
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,240
electronic

1320
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,559
essentially to coordinate the mobs that

1321
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,800
overthrew the government and people said

1322
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,040
well this means that cyberspace and this

1323
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,440
technology is going to be used as a

1324
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,680
great democratizing influence

1325
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,119
it's 2022 now authoritarian governments

1326
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,520
with the largest population in the world

1327
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,000
are using this same technology not to

1328
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,079
allow for a liberal democracy but to

1329
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,640
monitor and govern the behavior of human

1330
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,880
peep of human beings

1331
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,559
what i think this really means is that

1332
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,960
people need to make themselves literate

1333
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,599
we buy and adopt this technology but do

1334
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,200
we always ask ourselves what are our

1335
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,200
responsibilities for its use everybody

1336
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,760
wants broadband connectivity i do too

1337
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,359
and i want it to be cheap i want it to

1338
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,920
be ubiquitous absolutely but on the

1339
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,599
other hand one of the things we've

1340
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,720
learned is we need to take

1341
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
responsibility for its use there's an

1342
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,440
awful lot of really bad dangerous

1343
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,640
disinformation and mal information today

1344
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,800
doing everything from telling us that

1345
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,960
that our election system can't be

1346
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,240
trusted to taking crazy and unproven uh

1347
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,960
you know using ivermectin to treat

1348
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
you know an anti-parasitic to treat a

1349
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,119
virus um you know an anti-parasitic for

1350
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,359
cattle to try to treat a virus in human

1351
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,319
beings

1352
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,920
so i think one of the things that we

1353
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,160
need to do is to become an educated and

1354
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,040
responsible populous that i think is a

1355
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
very very big deal

1356
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,520
another attendee is asked how can we

1357
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,680
compromise between gathering information

1358
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,240
for national security reasons and giving

1359
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,520
our citizens china privacy in a country

1360
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
like china if a country like china does

1361
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,880
not care about the privacy of their

1362
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,000
citizens

1363
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,319
is it impossible for the u.s ever to

1364
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,400
gain advantage over these autocratic

1365
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,880
countries

1366
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,680
i remain fundamentally optimistic on

1367
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,119
this point

1368
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,880
i think the united states has had a

1369
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,160
vigorous and sometimes painful

1370
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,800
discussion about gathering information

1371
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,200
for national security and privacy the

1372
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,760
revelations from edward snowden were

1373
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,800
painful

1374
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,280
um and and for people like me coming out

1375
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,640
of the coming out of the national

1376
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,599
security environment you know i was you

1377
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,599
know not happy to see this you know i

1378
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,839
was not pleased with him but on the

1379
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,559
other hand um it is important for our

1380
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,559
country that we recognize that we really

1381
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,480
do have a fourth amendment in the in our

1382
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,079
constitution

1383
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,800
i think the level of debate about this

1384
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,040
is evidence that we probably will

1385
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,839
continue

1386
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,920
to work hard at that balance and that

1387
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,000
balance will shift and it should shift

1388
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,599
from time to time right

1389
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,000
you know some days it's the day after 9

1390
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,319
11. some days it's not

1391
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
and that balance is going to shift and

1392
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,760
that's going to be a moving target and

1393
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,520
the fact that we have three branches of

1394
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,960
government and a couple of major

1395
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,440
political parties and lots of competing

1396
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,119
interests in this country means that it

1397
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,599
will always move that needle is always

1398
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,319
going to move and that's not a bad thing

1399
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,800
and that level of debate i think remains

1400
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,880
active the other reason i'm i am frankly

1401
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,200
um optimistic is that you know i teach

1402
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,440
as an adjunct at georgetown

1403
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,599
and i'm in i have the privilege of

1404
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,079
engaging in a lot of conversation

1405
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,319
um with my students and they're

1406
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,280
thoughtful about this you know they

1407
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,400
they

1408
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,000
are confident in the future and they

1409
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,680
don't necessarily believe that just

1410
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,359
because a country is trying to be a

1411
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,480
monolith

1412
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,680
that that monolith is is is invulnerable

1413
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,079
we looked in the cold war at the soviet

1414
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,000
union in china as this communist

1415
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,319
monolith that we could never get through

1416
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,040
it but yet you know our our point of

1417
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,800
view is actually

1418
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,480
really quite successful

1419
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,640
and at least one authoritarian country

1420
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,920
right now

1421
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,359
which believed that it could do pretty

1422
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,200
much anything it wants

1423
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,599
and thought that the variety of opinions

1424
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,119
and interests that existed among the

1425
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,280
liberal democracies would not allow them

1426
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,359
to come together has actually gotten

1427
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,280
rather a nasty shock

1428
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,000
so

1429
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,960
you know i think that that you know that

1430
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,040
if someone is looking for a compromise i

1431
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,839
would say it's a dynamic compromise and

1432
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,559
one that that that will always be moving

1433
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,319
and always should moving

1434
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,359
i see there is another question

1435
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,440
am writing a paper right now about how i

1436
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,520
feel data laws are lagging while smart

1437
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,960
tech is sprinting

1438
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,559
do i have good sources where i can

1439
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,319
research this claim and look into the

1440
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,920
current advancements being made in

1441
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,280
legislation and regulation

1442
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,960
there are several places in which i'd

1443
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,800
look first you ought to take a look at

1444
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,680
the earn it legislation which is pending

1445
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,800
on the hill

1446
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,880
it has bipartisan support i think it

1447
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,599
also has bipartisan opposition that's a

1448
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,440
good place to look there's an

1449
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
organization that's looking at security

1450
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,119
and freedom in cyberspace called

1451
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,760
xrsi

1452
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
i think some of their publications are

1453
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,160
are are interesting in fact i co-wrote a

1454
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,079
paper with them on securing the

1455
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,640
metaverse which is a term i barely

1456
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
understand so why was it what what what

1457
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,960
business did i have in writing a paper

1458
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,280
and if you want i'll put my my email

1459
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,040
address here uh in in in the chat and

1460
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,599
i'd be happy to to take your questions

1461
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,800
offline

1462
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,119
douglas rap says it is unlikely that in

1463
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,720
the current political environment the

1464
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,160
governments and the profit-driven

1465
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,720
industries that support them will be

1466
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
willing to educate the populace on

1467
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
digital ethics the humane use of

1468
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,079
technology

1469
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,079
do you think the concept of universal

1470
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,240
ethics can be propagated via social

1471
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,359
media

1472
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,640
well

1473
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,079
i think almost anything can be

1474
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,920
propagated by social media there's

1475
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,359
evidence of that

1476
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,559
um and and including some pretty you

1477
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,599
know

1478
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,319
some some pretty uh highly refined ideas

1479
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,319
and stuff that absolutely

1480
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,599
is

1481
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,359
you know is is the stuff at the bottom

1482
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,240
of the pond um i don't think it is the

1483
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,119
job of government and industry to

1484
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,920
educate people on digital ethics

1485
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,160
i think it is the job of universities to

1486
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,160
do so i think it is the job of

1487
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,400
non-profits to do so and i think it is

1488
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,119
the job of human beings to do so to stop

1489
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,480
being lazy

1490
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,160
to stop saying well i read it on

1491
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,800
facebook or i saw it on twitter or i saw

1492
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,760
a video on tick tock so it must be true

1493
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,839
we have an educational system that needs

1494
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,760
to double down on teaching people the

1495
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,640
scientific method and critical thinking

1496
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,119
if you want to educate be educated on

1497
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,040
digital ethics or the humane use of

1498
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,440
technology i think it's important that

1499
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,680
you redouble your own personal

1500
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,799
commitment

1501
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,680
to critical thinking to asking where

1502
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,760
does this information come from what's

1503
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,400
its provenance why would i believe it's

1504
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,359
true

1505
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,040
just the fact that everybody says it

1506
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,920
doesn't necessarily make it make it true

1507
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,720
what is the source how do i how do i

1508
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,839
what tools do i have to evaluate the

1509
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,720
validity of the information its veracity

1510
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,480
and even the authenticity of its

1511
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,640
provenance i think this is a human

1512
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,640
responsibility not necessarily a

1513
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,559
government's responsibility

1514
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,400
china by the way i think believes that

1515
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,640
it is their responsibility to teach

1516
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
digital ethics their way and i think

1517
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,000
that's what they're doing

1518
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,079
has our society managed to adapt

1519
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,880
positively to the advent of cyberspace

1520
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,400
newspapers make a moderately

1521
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,240
professional source of news accessible

1522
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,799
to everyone it seems like in our country

1523
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,720
the ability of including every of

1524
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,240
including the uninformed to have their

1525
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,000
voice heard is tearing us apart

1526
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,520
that may be true

1527
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,000
i guess i would go back to my prior my

1528
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,760
my my prior uh my prior answer and that

1529
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,319
is i think it is time not to teach

1530
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,799
people what's true but to teach people

1531
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,119
to use the tools by which they can make

1532
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,119
these determinations

1533
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,240
otherwise

1534
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
we will be subject to information that

1535
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,280
is untrue and in some cases deliberately

1536
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,839
untrue where cyber security will

1537
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,599
represent the malicious use of

1538
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,839
information at that third level where

1539
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,000
the best story won't be the truest story

1540
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,680
but it will be the one that is the most

1541
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,599
compelling

1542
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,839
um i'm going to take these last two to

1543
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,799
what extent should access to cyberspace

1544
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,920
and technology be used in foreign policy

1545
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,839
the u.s is fortunate to dominate the

1546
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,920
technology that invented cyberspace

1547
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,680
should we use it to advance our foreign

1548
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,160
policy objectives such as freedom and

1549
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,400
democracy as well as potentially lesser

1550
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,359
things

1551
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,040
i think broadly speaking the answer to

1552
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,400
that is yes i don't know that we

1553
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,160
dominate it because

1554
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,680
you know we there are more people in

1555
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,280
china online than there are people in

1556
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,720
the united states and there are a lot of

1557
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,599
people

1558
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,240
look there are you know 7.6 billion

1559
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,119
people

1560
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,960
in in the world

1561
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,280
over half of them are online you know

1562
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
the united states we have a commanding

1563
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
role in the technology but we're not the

1564
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,359
only ones

1565
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,200
what i would say is that we should be

1566
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,440
vigorous in working with our allies and

1567
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,119
partners working with other liberal

1568
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,559
democracies

1569
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,280
working with japan working with with

1570
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,359
with uh with with

1571
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,839
the republic of korea working with with

1572
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,000
the countries in the eu working

1573
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,680
throughout africa working in latin

1574
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,240
america with other countries in asia

1575
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,960
to the extent that we can

1576
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,520
to share our point of view and to make

1577
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,359
clear that one can have a stable

1578
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,280
democracy and a stable and healthy

1579
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,480
society without persistent surveillance

1580
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,119
and persistent governance in cyberspace

1581
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,160
i think that's absolutely a possibility

1582
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,599
should we cut off our foreign

1583
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,280
adversaries like russia and china with

1584
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,359
their access to cyberspace to let only

1585
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,079
liberal democracies have these tools

1586
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,319
what would be the the consequences of

1587
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,119
having two incompatible cyberspaces

1588
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,440
i don't know that one can cut them off

1589
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,760
what i would say is the state-centric

1590
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,520
view that these countries are taking to

1591
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,359
cyberspace where they say it's not a

1592
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,119
global commons

1593
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,880
means that they intend to be able to

1594
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,440
isolate themselves as much as they need

1595
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,319
to

1596
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,960
impose their own rules their own kind of

1597
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,319
governance their own kind of

1598
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,760
surveillance

1599
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
so i think the real question is what do

1600
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,480
we do to encourage countries not to

1601
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,839
adopt a state-centric view of cyberspace

1602
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,240
and exercise cybersecurity from a

1603
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,839
state-centric view where they cut

1604
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,440
themselves off that's my larger concern

1605
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,200
i'm going to stop at this point because

1606
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,000
it's 5 30. i will put in chat my contact

1607
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
information

1608
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,160
if there is a last question spaff i

1609
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,960
would like to turn it over to you

1610
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,359
uh well thank you so much sam i think

1611
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,680
this is a topic we could certainly go on

1612
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,359
for quite a bit longer

1613
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,400
uh and perhaps we will touch on this at

1614
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,599
another point

1615
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,760
some of this may come up at the serious

1616
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,760
symposium at the end of the month and i

1617
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,599
would encourage people to consider

1618
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,240
registering for that

1619
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,119
but

1620
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,559
thank you for

1621
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,880
speaking with us today thank you for

1622
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,280
being willing to answer follow-ups uh

1623
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,400
people

1624
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,920
we'll we'll wait for a few moments here

1625
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,640
for people to copy that down from the uh

1626
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,799
the chat session if they wish

1627
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,040
and uh perhaps we'll get to see you in

1628
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,799
person sometime

1629
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,319
in the near future

1630
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,400
i would i would very much enjoy that

1631
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,000
stuff and

1632
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,520
enjoy meeting with your students and of

1633
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,760
course it's always a pleasure to see you

1634
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,720
yes and and and likewise um i i think uh

1635
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
for everybody who's listening in some of

1636
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,079
the issues that have been brought up

1637
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:44,880
here

1638
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,400
and um were were brought up earlier uh

1639
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,839
by

1640
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,480
uh professor demcheck and her talk

1641
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
uh we should

1642
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,920
pay attention to what's going on in the

1643
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,160
news right now with the ukraine and

1644
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,359
russia

1645
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,480
and what various sanctions are bringing

1646
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,559
the calls for instance to

1647
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,200
to uh cut off russia from the internet

1648
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,400
um are a bad idea actually for some of

1649
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,520
the reasons you had right for

1650
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,960
communications for personal

1651
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,440
communications and the un has recognized

1652
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,839
internet access as a human right

1653
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,559
so we have some very interesting uh

1654
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,960
evolution to go on in this and look at

1655
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,880
some of the side effects

1656
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,720
so with that people by now should have

1657
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,520
copied down your address uh

1658
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,920
you have other things to do as do all of

1659
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,160

1661
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,839
next seminar

01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,440
bef it's been a pleasure and thank you
