1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,120
uh our next presenter is uh a serious

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
post-doc uh washington medal is a

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,359
postdoc

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,240
student in a dual in industrial

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
engineering and civil engineering yet

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,160
again

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,760
the example that sirius is truly an

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,279
interdisciplinary education and research

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,400
institute

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
uh and his uh

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
his uh academic advisor or faculty

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,439
advisor he is embedded in the lab

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
i recently got to know

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
and uh satisha told me he said well i've

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
been meaning to reach out to you for a

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
couple of years now because i'm

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
venturing more and more into security

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
especially in critical infrastructure

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
and it looks like we're going to be

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
writing a proposal together this uh this

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
spring and summer uh on

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
um

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
autonomous and connected vehicles so

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
djinn this might be something that we'll

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
want to talk to you about as well

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
uh but uh yeah so it's exciting to see

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
this and civil engineering was one of

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,760
those departments that we didn't have

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
anybody embedded in us uh but we do now

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
so washing welcome we're excited to hear

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
about your research

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
thanks

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
uh is it valuable to

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
everyone great okay

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,920
oh thanks for the continued accent so i

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
am uh as you have heard i'm washing

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
within mandal so i'm a postdoctoral

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
researcher at uh civil engineering and

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
i'm also affiliated with the industrial

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
engineering as well so i'm working with

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
professor shati sukhasri for last one

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
year

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
and as a postdoctoral researcher so this

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,360
presentation was supposed to be

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
delivered by him but unfortunately he is

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,079
not present so i'm kind of presenting on

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,000
behalf of him so let's get started

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
because we are kind of already delayed

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
okay

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
so the topic of my presentation is ah

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,680
cyber physical security in intelligent

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
transportation network

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,199
oh

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
is it being distorted here

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
ok

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
so let us say you are moving ah

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,920
you are moving you are travelling on a

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,719
highway right and let us say

59
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
your current position is depicted by in

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
one of this

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
vehicles and let's say uh from your

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
current position five kilometers down

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
the line there has been a minor accident

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,959
which is creating some kind of

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
congestion down the lane or down the

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,879
road now you are not aware of this

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,879
particular uh situation that is

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
happening five kilometers down the road

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
but you are seeing that some of the

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
vehicles are kind of slowing down you

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
are seeing the effect but you do not

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
know the cause of this thing

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
and also assume that from your current

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
position one kilometer down the line

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
there is a escape route so if you take

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
that escape route you might be able you

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
might be able to avoid that kind of

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,879
congestion that is being created five

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
kilometers down the line but if you take

80
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
the escape route you have to travel a

81
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,440
longer distance to reach your

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
destination now at this current position

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
you have two options either you can take

84
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,200
the original route you do not change

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
your route or you can take the escape

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
route and you reached your destination

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
but the trade-off is that if you take

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
that escape route then you have to

89
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
travel a larger distance now what should

90
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,000
you do

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
so if your vehicle is not a connected

92
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
vehicle if it is just simple vehicle

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,879
which is not connected it is not

94
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
gathering information from

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
neighbors then you you cannot decide

96
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,239
actually because you do not have the

97
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
full information but suppose if you are

98
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
in this particular situation when

99
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
different vehicles are connected to each

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,920
other via a short range communication

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
then the situation could be dramatically

102
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,480
different

103
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
for example the vehicle which is present

104
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,519
five kilometers down the line at the

105
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
expedited stop at the accident spot uh

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
that can relay the information to its

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,280
neighbors and those neighbors can relay

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
the information to their neighbors and

109
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,159
in this way the information might

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,920
propagate through this whole network and

111
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
within a millisecond or few seconds you

112
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
might be updated about the situation

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
that is happening down the road now this

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,519
is one of the situations ah where then

115
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
intelligence is emerging out of this

116
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,440
network connectivity ah this is one of

117
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
the examples which we define as a

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
intelligent transportation network

119
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
so this kind of network where different

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
vehicles are connected to each other via

121
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
this short range communication

122
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
this kind of network is generally

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
defined as the internet of vehicles

124
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,519
so you might have heard about the

125
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
internet of things right so for example

126
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,680
if you if in your home different

127
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
electronic gadgets are different

128
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
connected to each other

129
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
by the short range communication

130
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,519
protocol

131
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
then we call this kind of a network a

132
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
and intel an internet of things or iot

133
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,759
network right so this is similar to an

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
iot network for the vehicular networks

135
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
so in the e-waste currently almost 50

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
million or more than uh 20 percent of

137
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
these current vehicles are ah

138
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
equipped with different kind of

139
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
connectivity so this connectivity of can

140
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
be of three types it could be a

141
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
connectivity to the cloud to the cloud

142
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
servers so this can be connected via

143
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
this traditional 4g or 5g communication

144
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
via the cellular network and it could be

145
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
a connection to the nearby different

146
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
kind of infrastructures for example the

147
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
vehicles could be reeling some kind of

148
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
information to the nearby traffic

149
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
controller they could be

150
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
relaying some kind of information to the

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,160
nearby

152
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
rsu or roadside units right which we

153
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
also call the aid servers and they can

154
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
be also be connected or they can be

155
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
delaying information to the nearby

156
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
vehicles as well so these three type of

157
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
communication that might have rise one

158
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
is vehicle to vehicle one is the vehicle

159
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
to information vehicle to infrastructure

160
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
and third is the vehicle to the cloud

161
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
so why this kind of connectivity is

162
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
required so there could be several

163
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
applications so i will be just listing

164
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
few of them one could be this cloud

165
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
assisted fault diagnosis suppose that

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
something has broken down in your

167
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
vehicle it is not that serious that you

168
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
have to stop but it is certainly a major

169
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
issue now ah so if your vehicle is kind

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
of equipped of that kind of

171
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
communication so that can ah generate

172
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
the logs of these vehicles and that can

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
be transmitted via different kind of

174
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
connectivity channels to the cloud

175
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
servers right and the cloud servers can

176
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
read this log and that can diagnose what

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
is the fault of this vehicle and then

178
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
suggest some kind of remedy for that

179
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
that can be done on the fly you do not

180
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,479
have to store anywhere it did not have

181
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,840
to stop anywhere

182
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
and it could also be

183
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
very useful for the autonomous driving

184
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
as well right for example in the

185
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
autonomous driving what you do you have

186
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,759
different kind of cameras with different

187
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
kind of sensors equipped in your vehicle

188
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
and those kind of informations are

189
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
perceived by this uh

190
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
this autonomous vehicle and they are

191
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
processed by different kind of deep

192
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
learning networks right but your vehicle

193
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
there might not be equipped with that

194
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
kind of computation power so what you

195
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,600
have to do you have to partially offload

196
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
some of this inputs or some of this data

197
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
to the cloud servers the the cloud

198
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
server they are equipped with that kind

199
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
of computation they can do different

200
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,600
kind of computation and suggest

201
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
different kind of action strategy for

202
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,840
your vehicle so for autonomously vegas

203
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
so this kind of communication with the

204
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,800
server that might be very necessary

205
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
thing

206
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
so there are other applications as well

207
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,039
that i am not going through

208
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,880
so this particular picture that

209
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
summarizes the kind of communication

210
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
that you're talking about so in the

211
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
left

212
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
in the right up

213
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
you can see there is a picture of the

214
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
cav and that is being connected to

215
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
different other cbs which is shown in

216
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
the yellow box below that and that can

217
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
be also be connected to different kind

218
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
of uh this uh traffic controllers which

219
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
are the common uh traffic lights that

220
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,599
could be equipped with different kind of

221
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
competition power and those vehicles

222
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
they might also be connected to

223
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
different kind of roadside units as well

224
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
so that might act as a different kind of

225
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,199
edge servers

226
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
and those uh traffic controllers and

227
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
those a servers they themselves might be

228
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,479
connected to different kind of cloud

229
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,800
servers as well so you might be able to

230
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
directly connect to the servers via this

231
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
4g or 5g communication and you can also

232
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
connect to the servers via this roadside

233
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,639
infrastructures as well

234
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,639
so this is the summarization and this

235
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,800
particular picture shows that uh

236
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
what kind of ah

237
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
instruments are generally being ah this

238
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
different connected vehicles are

239
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
generally being equipped with so in

240
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,479
addition to this communication uh units

241
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
right so those are required for uh

242
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
dedicated short range communication so

243
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,000
this connected fakers they are generally

244
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
be generally equipped with different

245
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
kind of uh cameras for perception of the

246
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,199
nearby roads and they could be uh

247
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
equipped with different kind of gliders

248
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,479
or different kind of radars you need so

249
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,000
lighters and the radars they will be

250
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,039
required

251
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
ah so though what they do is they

252
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,840
basically transmit different kind of

253
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
radio signals and if those radio signals

254
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,599
are getting reflected back by different

255
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
kind of obstacle then by analyzing the

256
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,120
reflected waves you can basically say

257
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
that if there is a certain kind of

258
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
obstacle nearby and if there is any is

259
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
an obstacle then how much uh what is the

260
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
distance between your vehicle and that

261
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,840
particular obstacle so this basically is

262
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
a summarization of

263
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
ah different kind of instruments that

264
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
the cvs are equipped with

265
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,639
so

266
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
until now so we have been talking about

267
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
different modes of communication now we

268
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
can talk about what are the contents of

269
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
different kinds of communication that is

270
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
happening in this vehicular network so

271
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
for example if you look at this v2v or

272
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
v2i type of communication uh then so one

273
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
of the basic

274
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
kind of communication is of the

275
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
communication of basic safety messages

276
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,479
right so for example that can include

277
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
different kind of locations the location

278
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
speed and the heading information the

279
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
trajectory information of that vehicle

280
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
and that might be broadcasted to nearby

281
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,279
vehicles or to the roadside

282
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,959
infrastructure units for further

283
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
processing or coming up with a traffic

284
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
signal plan and for these are generally

285
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
transmitted 10 frames per second now if

286
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
you look at the vehicle to cloud type of

287
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
communication there can be two type two

288
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
types of communication one could be

289
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
transportation related communication one

290
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
could be non transportation related

291
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
communication so for example in the

292
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
non-transfer an example of

293
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
non-transportation

294
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
uh type of communication is if you want

295
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
to fetch the weather report data so that

296
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
is non-transportation type of

297
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
communication and if you talk about the

298
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
transportation related communication

299
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
that could be

300
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
the road congestion network right so if

301
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
you want to visualize the whole what is

302
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,480
the situation of the congestion in the

303
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,680
whole network then you have to fetch

304
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
that data from the cloud and for example

305
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
uh there could be

306
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
if you want to plan your route

307
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
accordingly then you have to do that

308
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
kind of calculation in the cloud because

309
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the vehicles are they are generally not

310
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,360
equipped with that kind of computation

311
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,320
power

312
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
so

313
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:42,800
and that's

314
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
this uh we talked about vehicle to cloud

315
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
and now let's talk about infrastructure

316
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
to cloud this infrastructure to cloud as

317
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
you've already mentioned it could be

318
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
transmitting different sorts of

319
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
information for example what is the

320
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
current uh situation of congestion

321
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
situation in that particular network or

322
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
that particular intersection how many

323
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
number of connected vehicles are there

324
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
how many number of non connected

325
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
vehicles are there or what is the

326
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
current uh this signal phase at that

327
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
particular intersection all these kinds

328
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
of information that might be transmitted

329
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
from infrastructure to the cloud

330
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
so this is again a summarization of

331
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
different kind of services or different

332
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
kind of ah activities that we are

333
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
talking about so ah you can see that

334
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,160
this cloud infrastructure that is

335
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
connected to different uh

336
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
vehicles via this vehicle to cloud

337
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
communication and this cloud

338
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
infrastructure that could be connected

339
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,079
to different uh nearby roads units

340
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
different uh traffic controllers as well

341
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,720
so this this clouds they basically serve

342
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
three different kinds of services one

343
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
could be the uh there's your

344
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
infrastructure as a service

345
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,800
another could be your platform as a

346
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
service another could be the software as

347
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
a service so what does it mean so so for

348
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
example if you want to just store some

349
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
some amount of data in the cloud right

350
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,959
you do not want to do anything else with

351
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
that so that could be an example of

352
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,399
infrastructure as a service so you are

353
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,519
just using the cloud as an

354
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,120
infrastructure and if you want to

355
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
perform some kind of manipulation on the

356
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
data on top of that then that could be

357
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
an example of a platform as a service

358
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,920
right

359
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
and

360
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
so for and another kind of uh service

361
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,959
that is provided software as a service

362
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
so for example if you want to fetch your

363
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
route planning so that kind of

364
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
competition has to happen in the cloud

365
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
and then that output is downloaded into

366
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,160
vehicle right so those kind of

367
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
services that is provided by different

368
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
kind of softwares so

369
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,279
that is another type of services that

370
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
that is provided by the cloud

371
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
so this is an summarization of again the

372
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,079
scenario that you are talking about

373
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,360
different vehicles are connected to each

374
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
other vegas are connected to

375
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,560
infrastructure for example this your

376
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
traffic controller and the traffic

377
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,880
controllers could be connected to

378
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
different kind of

379
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,360
cloud servers

380
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
now of course this kind of situation is

381
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
desirable because this has many

382
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,320
application that we are now talking

383
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
about right so it has it is required for

384
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,519
route planning it is required for

385
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,279
autonomous driving it is required for so

386
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,519
many other things but it also raises the

387
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,279
questions right so if someone gains

388
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,320
access

389
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
to in one of these components and they

390
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
can control this output of that

391
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
component and what will happen so there

392
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
is an increasing vulnerability in this

393
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
ah vehicular connected networks and now

394
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,519
the question becomes how do we address

395
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,680
this kind of situations

396
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,519
now before going into the preventive

397
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
measures that you can take

398
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,839
so we first have to discuss that what we

399
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,160
want this kind of server physical

400
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
security system

401
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,560
from

402
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,000
so what are what are the key features

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,839
that we should be looking for in this

404
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,320
cloud in this cyber physical vehicular

405
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
security system so we mainly will be

406
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
looking for three uh key features there

407
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
could be other features as well but i am

408
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
just listing only three key features the

409
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,320
first we said is the confidentiality of

410
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
the privacy so what does it mean so for

411
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
example when you are connected to the

412
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,399
cloud right so you might want to save

413
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,720
several kind of information for example

414
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
your vehicle id related authentication

415
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
code right so in your vehicle and you

416
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
might be willing to uh so you have to

417
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
probably also store different kind of

418
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
information regarding your vehicles

419
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
right the engine number or probably the

420
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,160
owners name and address all these kinds

421
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
of information might be stored in the

422
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
cloud now all these kind of informations

423
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
are kind of sensitive data and you do

424
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
not want to

425
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
give access to this data to a third a

426
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
malicious party

427
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
right so this is so when you can ensure

428
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,200
that no third party although no

429
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,279
malicious season can get access to those

430
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,760
kind of data then we

431
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
we call that a confidential proof or

432
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
privacy proof system

433
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,800
and the second aspect is the integrity

434
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
so if you are generating some data then

435
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
the system should ensure that that data

436
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
is not changed

437
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,720
right for example if you are let say

438
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
if you generating a route plan right so

439
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
if you if you're giving input some input

440
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
you are saying that i want to go from

441
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
point a to point b and you are

442
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
transmitting that kind of information to

443
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
the cloud and the in the mean

444
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
in the mean time during when that

445
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
communication happens so someone or some

446
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
third analysis party that they are

447
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,279
getting access to that kind of

448
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
information and they're changing the

449
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
data on the fly then what will happen so

450
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
the cloud will be seeing something

451
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,079
different right the cloud might be

452
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
saying that okay you want to go from

453
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
point a to point c not from point a to

454
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,279
point b

455
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
so if this kind of changes

456
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
are happening so different kind of

457
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
problems might be arising so for example

458
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
one of the ah

459
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
effect could be the congestion in the

460
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
road network so people are trying to go

461
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,560
somewhere and you are just redirecting

462
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,639
them to somewhere else so this is one

463
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,079
problem that might arise so you want to

464
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,839
ensure that the integrity of the data

465
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
that is ensured and the third is the

466
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
availability of the service so for

467
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
example we are talked about this

468
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
autonomous vehicle right so the vehicle

469
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,399
the data those vehicles are constantly

470
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,440
in communication with the cloud

471
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
infrastructure and they want to get

472
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
different kind of informations all the

473
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,079
time

474
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,839
because not all the competition can be

475
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,440
done in the vehicle itself they do not

476
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
they are not equipped with that kind of

477
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
competition capability so if those kind

478
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,680
of communication is broken down by some

479
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
members for example you are creating a

480
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,639
jamming signal right you are

481
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
transmitting a high power signal ah

482
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
centered at a certain frequency and in

483
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,399
those cases your vehicle cannot

484
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,839
communicate with the nearby roadside

485
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
unit so what will happen that you cannot

486
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
get any information from that roadside

487
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
unit or from the cloud infrastructure so

488
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
in this cases your whole system might

489
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
collapse

490
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
so

491
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,279
these three things so when you we are

492
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,040
talking about when you want to design

493
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
some kind of cyber physical system we

494
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,639
want to ensure that these three key

495
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,600
features are ensured

496
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
sorry

497
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,839
now let us talk about different types of

498
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,760
cyber attacks that can happen in the

499
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
transportation system so uh based on the

500
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
attack

501
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
we can uh segregate the attack in two

502
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
types so one could be your uh attack on

503
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
the individual vehicle so vehicle is

504
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
vehicles are compromised and another

505
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
could be an attack on the whole system

506
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,600
level the whole system is compromised

507
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
and based on the consequence of the

508
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
attack it could be we can segregate the

509
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,399
attack in two types one could be the

510
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,360
active attack for whose uh the

511
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
the aftermath of that

512
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
of that attack is immediate and that

513
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
could be a passive attack for which the

514
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
aftermath could be delayed for several

515
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
days or the malicious agent that could

516
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
have some other intention to use with

517
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
the data so let us take some examples

518
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
let's talk about this vehicle level

519
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
attacks so one of the attack could be

520
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,519
gaining access to the ecu's esu is

521
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,120
basically electrically electrical

522
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,639
control units right so for example there

523
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
could be some automated units which

524
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,360
controlling the

525
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,759
rpm of this your engine it that could be

526
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,120
controlling your steering in the

527
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
autonomous vehicle right if someone is

528
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
getting access to those kind of control

529
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
units that can create a havoc

530
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
right and there could be

531
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,279
other kinds of attack for example

532
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
someone getting access to the sensors

533
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
data right so they can actually

534
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
deactivate the sensors or can feed a

535
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,839
false information to the sensors that

536
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
could be very dangerous and so for

537
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
example if there is a bend and somehow

538
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,519
someone getting access to the sensors

539
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,199
and saying that there is no bend then

540
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
you go and hit

541
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
the fence there right so those different

542
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,199
kind of

543
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
consequences might arise another thing

544
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,800
would be broadcasting certain messages

545
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,279
to create elicited illicit reaction of

546
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
the vehicles for example if someone just

547
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
if there is a broadcasting message that

548
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
says that ok there has been accident

549
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
just few meters down the road then you

550
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
will be just creating a very ah high

551
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,439
intensity break and that might

552
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,880
that might have some consequences as

553
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
well

554
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,679
and we also talked about this man in the

555
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,199
middle attack so manly the meeting is

556
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,799
basically you have one agent which is

557
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,160
transmitting some information and there

558
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
is another agent which is receiving some

559
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
information and the middle there is a

560
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
third agent which is basically receiving

561
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,880
those transmitted information and

562
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,319
changing something and then again

563
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,799
retransmitting to the ah your receiver

564
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
so this is basically called the man in

565
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
the middle attack and that can happen in

566
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
a vehicle to infrastructure type of

567
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
communication or vehicle to cloud type

568
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
of communication all those things

569
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
so and another is just is dropping which

570
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
is basically a passive attack you your

571
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
immediate consequences kind of delayed

572
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
so there is no immediate consequence but

573
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
uh the malicious season they could be

574
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
collecting different kinds of

575
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
information like an information about

576
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,280
your routes

577
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
information about your uh your the the

578
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
name of the owners address of the owners

579
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
all those kinds of sensitive information

580
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,200
that we collected

581
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
now let's talk about the system level

582
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
attacks so one of this could be the

583
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
denial of the service attacks so we are

584
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
talking about this attack a few few

585
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
minutes before so in this case uh what

586
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,840
happens is that uh so certain amount of

587
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
a bandit bandwidth is allocated right

588
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
for this vehicle to infrastructure

589
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,880
communication

590
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,840
now uh if you by some means can flood

591
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
that bandwidth right

592
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,880
ah then

593
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
ah if you flood that bandwidth then uh

594
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
the receiver they cannot actually decode

595
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,320
that what is being actually uh the

596
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,440
internet and message are what is

597
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,480
actually being transmitted from the

598
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
vehicle to the infrastructure or from

599
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
the infrastructure to the vehicle so all

600
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,799
these different kinds of sorts of

601
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,640
scenarios might happen another thing

602
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,919
could be the generating incorrect

603
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
commands like so

604
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
uh so the example that you have also

605
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
talked about so let us say someone is

606
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,039
getting access to the traffic controller

607
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
it is generating the signal plan in a

608
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,280
way that is not an optimal solution or

609
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
it is not trying to minimize the queue

610
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
length or it is not trying to minimize

611
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
the delay of that vehicles or waiting

612
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,679
time of the vehicles so in this cases

613
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
what might happen is that there might be

614
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
large congestion in the vehicular

615
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,919
network so this in generating incorrect

616
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,200
commands from the controller that could

617
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
be a problematic scenario

618
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,000
so

619
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
and passive attack is

620
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,919
of course this collected different kind

621
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,280
of operational information from the

622
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
infrastructure right so for example it

623
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
could collect that what are the

624
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
statistics of the vehicle available at a

625
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,120
certain infrastructure for ah maybe some

626
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
future uses that can be exploited to

627
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,919
attack different kind of vulnerabilities

628
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,760
of this different infrastructure

629
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
and their another is this cyber cybel

630
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
attack so basically they create multiple

631
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,480
identities fake identities to

632
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
create

633
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
for example a

634
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
what do you call that a false queue

635
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
right so there is no queue and they are

636
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
basically controllers is perceiving that

637
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,039
there is some queue so in this case they

638
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,760
are

639
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,240
you are kind of indirectly forcing that

640
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
kind of infrastructure to take different

641
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,679
actions that are not intended

642
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,559
now

643
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,840
those are the different kind of attacks

644
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
that might happen in the vehicular

645
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
network right and what are the

646
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,679
consequences of that so we want to come

647
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,400
up with a system or an infrastructure or

648
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
a vehicular network in which those kind

649
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,039
of attacks have minimal consequences

650
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,440
so you want to design something in which

651
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,919
even if there is some kind of an attack

652
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
then the aftermath of the data key is

653
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,760
not that much consequential that is your

654
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
target and that's how you want to design

655
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
your whole system but the con the

656
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
question now is how do you design those

657
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
kind of situation and what kind of

658
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
measures that you should target

659
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
so one of the uh idea is that you want

660
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
to make the network as resilient as

661
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
possible now that now the question now

662
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
immediately becomes like what is network

663
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,919
resilience

664
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,640
so the network resilience is the ability

665
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
to resume functionality

666
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
even in the face of catastrophic failure

667
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
of some of its nodes

668
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
right so you have a network which

669
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
consists of different kind of nodes and

670
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
those nodes are connected to each other

671
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
by different edges right

672
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,559
and suppose an attack happens then some

673
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,960
of the nodes will be malfunctioning

674
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
for example if you take an access to the

675
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,720
vehicle then those vehicle might be

676
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,480
malfunctioning or if you take an access

677
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
of certain uh traffic controller those

678
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,039
traffic controller might be

679
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
malfunctioning and there could be attack

680
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
on the edges as well so for example your

681
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
vehicle is trying to communicate to the

682
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
infrastructure so you can gain access to

683
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
this communication channel and you can

684
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
actually either by jamming you can just

685
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
completely disrupt that communication

686
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
channel or via this man in the middle

687
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,960
attack you can change the content of

688
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
this communication channel right so all

689
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
sorts of things might happen and your

690
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
network might change as a result of this

691
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
attack

692
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
now the question therefore becomes that

693
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
how do you make sure that even or even

694
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
if all these things happens

695
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,280
so even if all these things happens and

696
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
uh and in the aftermath of those events

697
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
if your network

698
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,880
can perform the duty that it was

699
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
supposed to do

700
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,919
then you can say that your network is

701
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,360
kind of a resilient network that means

702
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,120
that attack does not change the nato

703
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
functionality as much so for example

704
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,360
let's take this example right so it's a

705
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
very simplistic description of a network

706
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
so in this case we have five outer edges

707
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
ah five outer nodes and one central node

708
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
right and all of this ah outer nodes

709
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
that are connected to only through this

710
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
central node so for example you can take

711
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,559
it to be a very simplistic computer

712
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,640
network so your internet is basically a

713
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
computer network so millions and

714
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
billions of devices are connected to

715
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,039
each other and you can just take it as a

716
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,320
very simplistic description of an

717
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,280
internet so which may be uh you are just

718
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
creating in your own university or in

719
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
your own department let's say so in this

720
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,600
case all of these nodes they can connect

721
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,360
to each other but they have to go

722
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,039
through the central node

723
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,799
right so this kind of situation that

724
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,919
exists

725
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,520
so now let us say what happens let us

726
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
say some there is a third party or

727
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
malicious party he gains access to the

728
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,240
central node right so he might say that

729
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,559
i want to give you any access ah through

730
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,159
this particular node so this is kind of

731
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
a denial of service attack then what

732
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,679
will happens in all these outer edges

733
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
they cannot connect to each other it is

734
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
not possible because all of them are

735
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
just going through only single node

736
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,919
now let us take another example right so

737
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
in this case what happens this is the

738
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,360
same kind of architecture that you are

739
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
talking about but with some additional

740
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,000
details or some additional changes so

741
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
in this case all of these outer edges

742
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
they are also connected to the central

743
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
node but additionally there is some ah

744
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
outer edges as well so this outer so

745
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
even if so let us say if there is a

746
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,799
third malicious party which is getting

747
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
access to the central node and is

748
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
basically creating a dos type of attack

749
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
then uh this central node that cannot be

750
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
accessed but still the outer edges they

751
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
can actually

752
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,679
connect to each other via this

753
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
additional edges that i have created so

754
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
what are the lessons from this kind of

755
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,880
example so one of the lessons is that

756
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,640
your resilience that is a function of

757
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
where that happens

758
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,159
the particular area where the attack

759
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,720
happens that matters and another uh

760
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,520
lesson is that your network structure

761
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,919
that heavily influences the resilience

762
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,000
of the network so in the previous case

763
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the network structure was this thing and

764
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
in this case our network structure is

765
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
this thing right so we can see that just

766
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,000
by changing the network structure we can

767
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
make some network to be heavily

768
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
resilient or we can make it

769
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,880
less resilient

770
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,760
so

771
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,279
it is generally the principle that if

772
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
you add some redundancy in the network

773
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
that is not going to hurt your

774
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,279
resilience

775
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,600
because

776
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
now this is the so the example that we

777
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
gave so that is a kind of a

778
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
network where only the structure of the

779
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,520
network matters not the functionality

780
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
for example so ah but in the

781
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,840
vehicular network the scenario is kind

782
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
of slightly different so why is that

783
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,640
case

784
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
so

785
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
in the previous example only the network

786
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,559
connections that were the only thing

787
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,480
that mattered to us but when you talk

788
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
about let us say a vehicular network

789
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,840
then

790
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
only talking about different roads and

791
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
those connectivity

792
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,440
that is not going to be the end of the

793
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
story so we have to in addition to the

794
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
physical state of the network that means

795
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
how different nodes of this ah network

796
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
are connected to each other for example

797
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
those connection could be connection

798
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
five different roads different bridges

799
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
and all those things right in addition

800
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,159
to those things we have to also talk

801
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
about the functional state of the whole

802
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,000
network what is the

803
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,960
traffic

804
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,279
density at a particular ah let us say

805
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,120
particular road and how it is going to

806
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
change what is the pattern and which

807
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
pattern does this traffic evolution

808
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
follow how does it evolve with time and

809
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
all those question that you should take

810
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,919
into account right so for example if you

811
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,440
just look at

812
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,520
only one snapshot of a

813
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,120
traffic network then you might see that

814
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
there is only very limited amount of

815
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
traffic connectivity at a certain road

816
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
but that might change drastically after

817
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
a few hours so all these things all this

818
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
time revolution and everything that you

819
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
have to take into account while

820
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,440
considering the resilience of the

821
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
vehicular network so that is a very

822
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
complicated problem so we haven't of

823
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,159
course we have a physical infrastructure

824
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,400
the the connection via different roads

825
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
those are connecting different let's say

826
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
intersections that that we have but in

827
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,240
on top of that we also have to take into

828
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
account the functional states and their

829
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,320
evolution with time while considering

830
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
the resilience of the network

831
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,760
right

832
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
so

833
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
ah

834
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
so now the question therefore becomes

835
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
right so how do we quantitatively

836
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,679
describe quantitatively describe the

837
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,120
traffic flow evolution within a given

838
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,799
network so let us say we have a

839
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,799
connection network that has given and

840
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
how the traffic levels happen at

841
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,159
different external loads that is given

842
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
now can you say that how will it evolve

843
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,480
with time and all those things so that

844
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
is the first question that should that

845
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,679
we should answer because if you cannot

846
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
answer this question then we do not know

847
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
how the traffic throughout this network

848
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
is going to evolve with time

849
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
the second is that

850
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
if certain ah

851
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
links are let us say disrupted right

852
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
some of the

853
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
ah roads are being congested or

854
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
something is happening someone is taking

855
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
some kind of a malicious ah doing some

856
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
kind of malicious attack on some kind of

857
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
in some of the vacants or some of the

858
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
infrastructures then how this traffic

859
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
flow will be changing with time will it

860
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,279
be drastically different will be very

861
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,880
similar how it will depend on the

862
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
network structure so those are the

863
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
question that we have to answer again

864
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
and

865
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
sorry

866
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,840
ok

867
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,400
sorry

868
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,320
so

869
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
and the second thing is how failure in

870
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,039
one link impacts the neighbor so suppose

871
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,760
ah

872
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
this is a connected network right so one

873
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
road is connected to others a vehicle

874
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
vehicle which is following through one

875
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,559
node that is going to impact what is

876
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,919
happening in the neighbor nodes right so

877
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
if a failure happens a certain network

878
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
or a certain part of the network then

879
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
how it is going to ah evolve throughout

880
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,960
this how it is going to spread

881
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
throughout this whole network that is

882
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
the question that you also have to

883
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,080
answer

884
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,880
so

885
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
now once we understand this whole

886
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,559
process right so first thing is that how

887
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
the network evolves in a natural network

888
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
second thing is if certain kind of

889
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,679
attack happens so some kind of failure

890
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,120
happens at the network then how this

891
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,279
traffic flow is going to change and once

892
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,039
you understand all of these things then

893
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,399
the next question is

894
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,559
now what so we we can take certain kind

895
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,159
of measures right to prevent this kind

896
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,640
of attacks now those kind of preventive

897
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,559
measures are kind of not uh they are

898
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
kind of costly costly measures

899
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,840
so if you have a certain budget

900
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
constraint then you have to judiciously

901
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
choose the why do you want to put those

902
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
kind of preventive measures in the whole

903
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
network you do not want to uniformly put

904
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
everywhere right because not every node

905
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
and not every road network is equally

906
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,480
important

907
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
so that is the last question that you

908
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,360
should answer

909
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,240
so ah in this regard so i would like to

910
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
ah go through one particular paper by

911
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
professor ukusuri and which was done in

912
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,919
2017

913
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,480
and so that paper kind of tries to

914
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
address this question

915
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,679
so in this paper

916
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
ah so they have taken data from the

917
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,080
beijing and the shanghai ah this road

918
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
traffic network and they have ah

919
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,320
so they

920
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,799
model this whole network uh via

921
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,320
something which is called the

922
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
dual graph model so in the general graph

923
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
model what in the normal graph model

924
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,159
what happens is that you model each of

925
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
the intersection as a node and each of

926
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
the road has an edge that connects with

927
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
ah that kind of different nodes but in

928
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
this dual graph model they model each of

929
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,320
this road as a node or a dual node

930
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,000
and ah

931
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
and different kind of intersections

932
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,799
ah as an dual edge so it is kind of a

933
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
dual representation so what was note in

934
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
the normal graph that has been

935
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,559
transformed in as a

936
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,480
edge and what was ah edge that is being

937
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,600
transformed as a node so there are

938
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
so if for example in this particular

939
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,480
figure you can see that this figure a is

940
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,320
a represents representation in the

941
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
normal graph or the ordinary graph and

942
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
the representation is the b is dual

943
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,279
transform now if something happens in

944
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,840
this particular edge or row row section

945
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,159
h e then in the normal graph you will be

946
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,360
just showing as a removed edge right and

947
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
nothing changes ah but in the dual

948
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,799
representation

949
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,000
this

950
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,799
road that is denoted by two this row two

951
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,080
so that will be kind of split by two ah

952
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,799
two what you call that two sections

953
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,159
or two

954
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
sub sub roots so

955
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,919
in the dual in the dual representation

956
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,159
that road was represented by node now

957
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,080
when that particular link breaks eight

958
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
heating brings then you can you

959
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
basically say that that note that was

960
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
representing the road to that is being

961
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
split so that is the idea behind this

962
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
vertex plate now what do we do and why

963
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
do not just use the normal graph

964
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,919
representation so it turns out that if

965
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,399
you just ah transform this whole network

966
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,840
into this dual

967
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,960
representation then several kinds of ah

968
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
advantages might be achieved so for

969
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
example the different kind of behaviors

970
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
that we see in the complex network so

971
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,159
that ah that that basically arises so

972
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,720
for example in the complex network we

973
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,200
see that uh this degree distribution of

974
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,640
different nodes in the network so that

975
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,720
follows ah power law distribution so

976
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
same kind of thing also we observe when

977
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,399
you transform the whole network into a

978
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,279
dual representation and ah so and if you

979
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,279
also observe the vertex plate right so

980
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,159
how the ah different vertexes are split

981
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,080
and so for example if you have this

982
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,240
nodes with certain degree k and after

983
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,080
the split it has been split

984
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
with nodes of degree i and nodes of

985
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
degree minus i then that

986
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,200
division that can be

987
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
adequately represented by a beta

988
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
distribution so these are certain

989
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
different kinds of features that arises

990
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,399
if you just transform the whole network

991
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,480
into the dual representation

992
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,360
and

993
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,399
the

994
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,360
recovery time right so let us say one ah

995
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,519
particular road has been

996
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,159
ah removed and after some time it is

997
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,000
getting it is getting uh it is it is

998
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
being recovered right because the

999
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,880
traffic is

1000
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
the congestion is being removed so what

1001
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
is the time from when the congestion

1002
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,519
start to when the congestion actually

1003
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
removed that time distribution is

1004
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
adequately represented by exponential

1005
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
distribution so all these kind of

1006
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,320
different kinds of

1007
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,679
advantages

1008
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,000
that we might see here

1009
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,799
so

1010
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,399
based on this different of empirical

1011
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,600
observation right the different kind of

1012
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
fitter distribution that we observe so

1013
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,279
the professor rokusari and his student

1014
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,279
they came up with a very nice numerical

1015
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,840
model that can actually predict that how

1016
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,480
the traffic flow is going to evolve with

1017
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,159
time so they are not exactly predicting

1018
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
the traffic flow but rather how the dis

1019
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,679
degree distribution of different nodes

1020
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,000
that is going to evolve with time so

1021
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,640
they came up with a model and that model

1022
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
that basically predicts how the those

1023
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,159
things are going to change with time as

1024
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
a function of the traffic load

1025
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,480
in the whole network so this is a one

1026
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
result that i have taken from that paper

1027
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
so it basically shows the traffic

1028
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
distribution and certain time instance

1029
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
in the city of beijing

1030
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,919
and you know this red

1031
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,360
edges they are basically showing the

1032
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
edges where the traffic is very slow

1033
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
this you can kind of dis describe them

1034
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
as a age which is not connected not

1035
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,720
connected edges and correspondingly you

1036
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,799
can see that how the degree distribution

1037
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,640
uh is obtained and this degree

1038
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
distribution is a kind of a time average

1039
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,840
degree distribution for the whole

1040
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
network

1041
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,640
right

1042
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,519
so they have obtained some ah

1043
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,480
so

1044
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
so this is

1045
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
this red line that you can see here this

1046
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,720
is the

1047
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
uh time evolution of the number of

1048
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,960
uh the number of dual vertices right so

1049
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
the number of vertices that is present

1050
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,399
in this whole network so if a vertical

1051
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,000
split so you are creating one additional

1052
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,919
vertices so if you count the number of

1053
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,600
vertices in this road network as a

1054
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
function of time the red is the observed

1055
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
one and this blue and the sky is ah

1056
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,919
these are the predicted one from that

1057
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,919
model so you can see that is very

1058
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,320
closely represented

1059
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,559
so further model so what what you can do

1060
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,000
so this particular model that you talked

1061
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
about they basically ah deal with the

1062
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,399
time evolution ah of a particular

1063
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,200
network as a function of time but uh

1064
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
when so these are not like disruptive

1065
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
changes right so it is not like someone

1066
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
has attack so basically they are in this

1067
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,960
model they are trying to predict if

1068
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,799
certain heavy congestion appears then

1069
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,240
what might be the corresponding

1070
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,480
scenarios but they are not uh treating

1071
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,840
uh

1072
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,279
where there could be a malicious attack

1073
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,880
from the third party now the question

1074
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,159
becomes how do you model those kind of

1075
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,760
situation will it be

1076
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
will this model be educated to represent

1077
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,799
those kind of scenarios or some we have

1078
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,799
to come up with something else to

1079
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,159
represent that

1080
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,480
so and finally once you understand so

1081
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
this is the part where you are trying to

1082
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
understand how the whole traffic thing

1083
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,639
ah is evolving with time how the network

1084
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,918
is changing with time and all those

1085
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,639
stuff right and finally uh we have to

1086
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
once you understand that adequately

1087
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,079
accurately then we have to come up with

1088
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,520
different kind of interdiction methods

1089
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
so

1090
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,159
for example this conventional

1091
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,399
cryptographic or security methods uh

1092
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,480
that might be challenging here because

1093
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
uh one thing is that we have limited

1094
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
computational capability in the vehicles

1095
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,159
and some kind of completion capability

1096
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,599
might be required to perform this kind

1097
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,399
of cryptographic applications and second

1098
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
thing is that there is a limited

1099
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,280
bandwidth so you do not have unlimited

1100
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
bandwidth to communicate from the

1101
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
vehicle to the infrastructure or from

1102
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
the infrastructure of the vehicle and

1103
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,839
third is that this is a highly mobile

1104
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,480
environment so let's say you are moving

1105
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,399
with some speed like say 100 miles per

1106
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,918
hour something like that

1107
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,079
and so there is a certain rsu that is

1108
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
present at the side of the node so once

1109
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
you get into that the coverage area of

1110
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,760
that rdu you have to connect to that rsu

1111
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,200
you have to authenticate and all the

1112
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,599
stuff will happen and

1113
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,040
by the time

1114
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,040
uh so you are moving at a very fast bit

1115
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,400
right so this coverage cannot be very

1116
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,880
large so uh you you'll be getting a very

1117
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
short amount of time to communicate with

1118
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
that particular rsu so all of these

1119
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
things your communication authentication

1120
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
cryptography everything has to happen

1121
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,000
within short span of time now this is a

1122
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
very challenging situation and it could

1123
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
be challenging as well because

1124
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
in the physical layers scenario right so

1125
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
wireless communication has different

1126
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,240
layers of communication you start with

1127
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,599
the physical layer in the physical layer

1128
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,440
you have to first estimate what is the

1129
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,320
channel

1130
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
gain of this particular communication

1131
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
channel from the vehicle to

1132
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
infrastructure now that will take some

1133
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,040
time and if your environment is very

1134
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,720
highly mobile then what you have

1135
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,480
estimated at certain point of time that

1136
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,560
might not be valid uh if certain time

1137
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,839
will happen so all these kind of

1138
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,599
scenarios might happen and then of

1139
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
course there is a low latency for

1140
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
critical messages right

1141
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,359
so this crea makes the conventional

1142
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,680
cryptography a very challenging ah tool

1143
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,440
to address these situations

1144
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,079
and so and another approach is that we

1145
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,839
can use different kind of ai or machine

1146
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,920
learning type of techniques to identify

1147
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,480
unusual activity in the vehicle level so

1148
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
we can

1149
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
use the machine learning algorithm to

1150
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
detect if something is out of ordinary

1151
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
it is supposed to happen but it is not

1152
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,640
happening or that person drives to that

1153
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
particular point but he is not driving

1154
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
at that particular to that particular

1155
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
point or maybe something unusual is

1156
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,079
happening he is accelerating too much or

1157
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,400
doing something very peculiar so all

1158
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,000
those kind of uh

1159
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,839
animal is that might be detected by the

1160
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
ai machine learning type of techniques

1161
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,119
so several kind of algorithms have

1162
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
already been deployed and several

1163
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,720
critical and non-critical components

1164
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,160
that might be detached so that might

1165
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,440
give us some resilience and also uh by

1166
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,760
creating by imposing some certain law

1167
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,119
and resolution

1168
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,480
we might enforce certain security

1169
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,880
measures and finally as we have already

1170
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
discussed adding redundancy in the

1171
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,160
network that might also enhance our

1172
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
resilience

1173
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
so another thing is that so let us say

1174
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,400
we know that how to go about increasing

1175
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
the resilience of the network but the

1176
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
attacker he might also know the

1177
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
situations so if you impose certain kind

1178
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,839
of preventive measures at certain point

1179
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,000
in this network then attacker might also

1180
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,480
see that okay so they have

1181
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
imposed this kind of resources or they

1182
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,680
have deployed this kind of resources at

1183
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
this point then i will just target and

1184
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,280
some other point right so that might

1185
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
also happen so

1186
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
if you decide something to do the

1187
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,040
attacker might do decide to do something

1188
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
else right so this is the kind of a

1189
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
scenario which is generally described by

1190
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,560
this game theory so there are certain

1191
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
papers who who are trying to address

1192
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
this kind of problem where the attacker

1193
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,200
is kind of dynamically targeting based

1194
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,880
on the available information and why to

1195
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,720
attack but this is also very hard

1196
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
problem to solve so partially because

1197
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,960
the all the models that are available in

1198
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
the current literature they do not

1199
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,960
address the uh the lack of information

1200
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
right so they just assume that everybody

1201
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
has the full information and

1202
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,480
only those cases they are kind of

1203
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,839
solving this problem but they are not

1204
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,680
trying to address the real problem that

1205
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,760
might arise in the real network

1206
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,839
so uh with this just i would like to

1207
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,920
conclude with the goals then what we

1208
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,680
should do and what basically professor

1209
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,400
ukusuri is trying to achieve

1210
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
in this particular regime so how first

1211
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,760
of all understanding how the cascading

1212
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,920
occurs in response of different attacks

1213
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,200
so you have a traffic evolution equation

1214
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
in the normal network now if something

1215
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,520
ah if someone is trying to attack in

1216
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
different parts of this network then how

1217
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,119
this evolution is changing so that is

1218
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,359
the first part of this equation second

1219
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,280
is how to distribute so once you

1220
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,720
understand that how this whole thing is

1221
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,400
happening then you have to judiciously

1222
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,040
decide where to put your resources so

1223
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,119
and while you will be doing that you

1224
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,200
also have to consider the different

1225
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,640
strategic profile that the attacker

1226
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,040
might take so with this i would like to

1227
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,440
summarize i would like to conclude and

1228
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,160
thank you for listening

1229
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,440
thank you ashim

1230
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,839
you
