1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,919
uh many of you in the audience uh know

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,399
or at least have have heard that uh

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,679
sirius is uh a lead technical university

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,559
for the simani effort which is a

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,400
department of energy initiative to

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
establish cyber security for energy

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,480
efficient uh advanced manufacturing

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,880
so uh we've completed the first year

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
research and there was an annual meeting

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
down in san antonio three weeks ago

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
yesterday uh actually it was two days

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
three weeks ago today as well um and i'm

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,320
sitting in the audience at that annual

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
meeting

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,719
and uh

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,200
tommy gardner was on the agenda to speak

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,640
and uh

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
i enjoyed the talk so much and and he

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
started talking on uh software security

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
and the supply chain and software bill

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
of materials and i went

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,600
well we're talking about that in three

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
weeks uh up at the symposium

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
uh and so after uh dr gardner's talk i

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,359
went up to him and said i know this is

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
very short notice and i'm not even sure

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,320
i can squeeze it into the agenda but

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
you're on target with what we're trying

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,600
to talk about and obviously your talk at

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
the simani conference aligns with our

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
simoni worked here

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
um so i uh uh i i darn your twisted his

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,360
arm to at least take a look at his

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,479
calendar

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,040
and he said if i can work it in

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
i'll do it so we came back we shuffled

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
the schedule around he shuffled his

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
schedule around

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
and it's our honor to be able to have

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
him today so

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
so tommy is currently serving as this uh

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
the cto the chief technology officer at

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
hp

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,880
federal

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,920
but previously to hp he held

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
similar roles with jacobs engineering

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
saitor and mantec

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
but i love going even further back into

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
his uh history where he served as a

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
senior technical executive at raytheon

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
and then also served as the deputy of

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
science and technology for the chief

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
naval research officer

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,920
tommy was part of the the program

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
yesterday

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
in the uh in the fireside chat uh again

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,440
was not was not surprised but was amazed

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
at his insight into cyber security from

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
a different perspective so it's my great

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,480
honor to be able to introduce dr tommy

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,920
gardner as our next speaker tommy

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,019
[Applause]

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
it was way too long introduction

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
could have been halfway through the

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
speech

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
no i really enjoy coming here i love

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
technical conferences i learn something

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
at everyone and anybody that tells you

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
they're a cyber expert they don't know

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
what cyber is there are no cyber experts

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
there are people who have deep in-depth

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,560
knowledge in certain areas of cyber

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
a few people that do that have an inch

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,319
or two deep in other areas of cyber but

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
there's no total

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
who knows it all that's just

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
there's too much to know and there's too

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
much to research

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
and i love an organization like this

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
because it allows you

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
uh to go in depth in areas it allows you

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
to stay up to speed to stay up to date

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
and uh that's probably the hardest thing

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
i have in this field

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
is trying to stay up to date in in the

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
cyber security world

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
i ask

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
the head of carnegie mellon's sei

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
who's an old friend from the air force

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
and uh how do you stay up to date at

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
carnegie mellon which is another

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,799
institute that has great cyber instincts

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
uh great software capabilities

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,760
and uh and they better watch out for

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
purdue or they're gonna fall down the

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
list of uh the u.s world report uh

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,519
listing if they're not careful you guys

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
are doing great here

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
uh and and the answer was you know it

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
takes everybody and it takes a community

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
sharing with each other

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
so you don't have to study it all in

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,879
in all areas you need to know your area

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,920
well and then be able to share and be

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
willing to share and that was great

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
advice uh paul nielsen is a

107
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
uh is a an

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
individual at carnegie mellon who uh and

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,279
he's gone out and hired some really good

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,320
people

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
and that's the key you can't do it alone

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
you've got to have support and have to

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
find the talent and use the talent and i

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
think you've done that here

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
and so 25 years

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
that's going to be a great celebration

117
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
next year and i i think uh 25 more after

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
that then then you'll have your feet on

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
the ground be

120
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,840
ready to be experts in cyber so we'll

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
see it'll change and it changes every

122
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
year that's the hard part

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
uh

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
brandon's boss

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
it says i've met her i've gotten to know

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
her

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
jen easterling very impressive lady

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
west point graduate and so you know any

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,320
time a west point graduate does go good

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,280
i'm i'm impressed but uh she she's

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
really been a leader in the the nice

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
thing about the federal government here

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,560
is jen easterling and chris inglis who

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
came out of nsa and now the cybers are

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
in the white house

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
they know each other they've worked with

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
each other for years

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
when jen was up at nsa working for chris

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
and uh and it's it's nice to see

140
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,199
chris who's an air force academy

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
graduate uh is doing really well

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
uh trying to build up an organization

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
trying to coordinate throughout

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
government uh what needs to be

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
coordinated in this field and uh

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,919
and

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
i i've gotten to know chris a bit uh

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
both when he was in nsa and and now in

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
his new position

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
and uh and

151
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
he he loves to talk to me not because i

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
know anything about cyber it's because i

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
was a submariner and his son went to the

154
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
naval academy and is now a submarine

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
officer and so i'm wanting to talk about

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
some nuance of cyber that i'm wrestling

157
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
with he wants to talk about the

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
submarine force because he wants to know

159
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
what his son's getting involved in what

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
his son's involved in i just and i just

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
love that about chris he's really

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
into his family and uh you know you have

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
to applaud that

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
uh as you go now i have never seen a

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
sister presentation

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
uh and i've seen quite a few of them

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
where he didn't tell you they need help

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
and they're have open wrecks ready to

169
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,759
offer jobs

170
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
and so i

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
you know you think by now they would

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
have had all their jobs filled but no

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
they're still looking for talent and and

174
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
i think you come back saying hey we're

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
here to help or it was a perfect

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
comeback because there are other

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
resources

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
uh government you don't have to have

179
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
everybody in government

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
working in a government position

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
you've got industry and academia ready

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
to support government at the drop of a

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,479
hat and it gets back to all it takes is

184
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
a little money you know that's what

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
makes it happen you got to have some

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
funding and the government has some

187
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
funding i've the congress ever gets a uh

188
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
budget approved this year which i think

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
you know it's on the way we'll get one

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
day there's an election this year

191
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
they're going to prove something

192
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
before they uh

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,680
people go to the polls so i'm kind of

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
optimistic on that

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
uh well hopefully too when uh when i was

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
at uh sign manny which really uh

197
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
as a mechanical engineer i love advanced

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
manufacturing issues

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
i i love

200
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,599
the work they're doing in this new doe

201
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
lab created at the university of texas

202
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
san antonio

203
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
that's looking at the

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
ability to secure

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
our industrial organizations

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
particularly manufacturing

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,840
and

208
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
3d print or advanced manufacturing you

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
know one of the goals and objectives is

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
bring the jobs back home now it's going

211
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,759
to be different jobs than the

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
manufacturing we did 30 40 50 years ago

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,440
but it's important jobs

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
more higher pay

215
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,639
for the jobs maybe fewer jobs

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
but the uh the transaction costs from

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
logistics in the transportation

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
is a savings

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
that will cover any capital investment

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,360
that you have to make at least

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
theoretically there's potential when you

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
can drive the economic order quantity

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
from

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,039
thousands to tens of thousands

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,279
down to an economic order quantity of

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,320
one

227
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
there's savings there's potential

228
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,919
for a cost of audience or actually true

229
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
cost savings in manufacturing

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
and it benefits the higher educated

231
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
american worker

232
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,399
uh from having jobs that are more uh

233
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,519
oriented in the high tech field

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,080
uh controlling numerical machines or

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
even a lights out factory you know it's

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
very very possible with the technology

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
we have that only hold up is economics

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,080
so

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,279
i'm really i'm really hopeful

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,440
that sign manny continues and the

241
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
success they've had in their first year

242
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
and appreciate the work that purdue and

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
serratus is uh

244
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
providing to support them

245
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
when i talk to that lecture the first

246
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
slide i have and i usually don't use

247
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
slides but they're insistent that i have

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
a slide

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
the first slide

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,839
it may have been the only one if

251
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,920
but uh was a picture

252
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
of a submarine periscope

253
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
it was unclassified which surprised me

254
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
but the crosshairs of the submarine

255
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
periscope

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
on a submarine somewhere

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
uh

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
in in the northern sections of the ocean

259
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
somewhere

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
and i i actually think it was a british

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
submarine just but the periscope

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
reticles they look the same hard to tell

263
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,800
i've been on british subs before

264
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
and i uh and i and i mentioned the crowd

265
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
you know here's

266
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,560
a uh submarine picture

267
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
of a victor

268
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
iii class submarine

269
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
and uh and being pretty confident that i

270
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
knew more about submarines than

271
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
everybody else in the audience

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
i was pretty confident that was a victor

273
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
three

274
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
uh

275
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
it turns out zach tudor who was on the

276
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
panel yesterday with me he actually knew

277
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
more about submarines than i did he did

278
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
the real work and he corrected me

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,560
he did it politely because he didn't do

280
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
it in front of the audience to embarrass

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,959
me

282
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,880
which would have been fine with me i

283
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,279
don't have any pride in that respects if

284
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
somebody knows more than you two you

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
ought to be embarrassed you know so i

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
hope if i say anything today somebody

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
will correct me and you know don't feel

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
like you're gonna embarrass me and zach

289
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
said hey tommy i you know that's an

290
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,279
alpha submarine that's not a victor

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,720
three and uh and he was in a position as

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
a data specialist

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
in the navy where one of his

294
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,079
responsibilities was training the

295
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,200
officers on the uh observing

296
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
through the periscope what the

297
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,200
classification of who is out there and

298
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
what is what are you looking at

299
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
and so his his expertise was much more

300
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,519
than mine and it's the same thing in

301
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
cyber you know you you think you know

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
something there is always somebody out

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
there that knows more than you do

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
and uh so be humble

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
and and just try to learn and

306
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,680
if if i go to bed every night thinking

307
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
what have i learned today and if i can

308
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,079
think of one thing that i learned that i

309
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
didn't know the day before it's been a

310
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
good day

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
you know you you should continuous

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,079
learning and that's what academia is all

313
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,240
about perdue does a really good job of

314
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
it congratulations on your number four

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,279
ranking

316
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,279
i see you're you're tied with carnegie

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
mellon so i think uh next year you might

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,959
head in security okay that's great

319
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
all right and uh i'm thrilled although i

320
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
think i've got to run to the airport

321
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,800
before he speaks

322
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
that richard clark is coming today i

323
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
have met him i've talked with him

324
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
you know he is a national treasure

325
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,519
and and uh joe i don't know how you got

326
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,279
him to agree to come

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
but uh you know it's

328
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
it's worth coming to a conference like

329
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
this just to hear him talk and so i

330
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
encourage you to stick around you know

331
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
and and and listen to what he has to say

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,399
he has insights far beyond uh what i'll

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
present and a lot of experience you know

334
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
in the decision-making at top levels of

335
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
government and i think he'll be

336
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
fascinating so

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,959
uh the the talk wasn't titled uh i don't

338
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,720
think it was titled simony either so

339
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
that that gives me the freedom and the

340
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
reign to talk about anything so i'm

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
going to talk about basketball

342
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
now i know basketball might be a sore

343
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
subject here with the final four going

344
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,360
on

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
but uh you know honest to goodness you

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
know being in the lead eight or being at

347
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,240
that top level like purdue was this year

348
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
that is a great accomplishment

349
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,360
not many teams get that far well only

350
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
about eight of them i guess so

351
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
uh you know the fact you didn't get to

352
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,440
the final four i was kind of pulling for

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
you hoping that you know this would be

354
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
kind of a celebration week and and all

355
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,839
but it's it's really a great a great

356
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
honor to uh have sporting events

357
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
i like that and cyber's much like a

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
sporting event and i'll see if i can

359
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,760
explain why

360
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
i couldn't play basketball to save my

361
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,320
life i love the game i love to play the

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
game but i can't shoot

363
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
got really bad eyesight if you can't see

364
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,720
the basket it's really hard to hit a

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,079
basket

366
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,839
i can't jump i've got about a two inch

367
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,200
vertical leap

368
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
you know i uh i think i'm michael jordan

369
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,160
out there but uh you know i just can't

370
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,760
rise the only thing i do well in

371
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,959
basketball

372
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,320
is set a pick

373
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
you know once my feet are planted i'm

374
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,320
not moving it doesn't matter who runs

375
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,760
into me you know i'm staying in place

376
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
and uh so it's a

377
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
you know it's a sport of specialization

378
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
some people pass well some people shoot

379
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
well uh some people are just tall and

380
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
rebound well

381
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
but they're people like me who can set a

382
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,839
pick

383
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
and we had a basketball team a bunch of

384
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
uh

385
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
civilians out of the government back

386
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,399
when i was still active duty

387
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,120
would play basketball and would

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
a bunch of 40 year old men at the time

389
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,880
and uh and we would uh

390
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
we would get out on the weekends and

391
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
we'd play a bunch of young 20 euros

392
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,800
and and you'd find that the 20 year olds

393
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,959
were really fast and they're really good

394
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,959
and speed matters

395
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
and they'd run up the court and score

396
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,920
two points

397
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,160
and we would walk down the court

398
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
i would set a pick and we had a guy he

399
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
was

400
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
assistant secretary of the navy

401
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
for uh

402
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,399
for ic for the communications in i.t

403
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,760
and uh uh

404
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
and he would come back and he could hit

405
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,839
nine out of ten three-point shots

406
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,440
any day of the week

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
and he would come behind my pick

408
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,120
shoot a three

409
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
and score

410
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
nine out of ten times

411
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
and uh and

412
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
we'd have to try to catch up with the

413
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
young kids get back there they'd score

414
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,399
two points

415
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
and and after the half

416
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,959
the kids would realize they're down by

417
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,600
10 points to these bunch of old men

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,279
well you know slow methodical

419
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,279
it it you know you know what you're

420
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,440
doing and you do it well

421
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
and you can beat a enemy or a competitor

422
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
that has talents that are much better

423
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,000
than you

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
but you got to be smart about it and

425
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
very similar to a cyber defense you got

426
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
to be smart about it you know they're

427
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
competitors out there there's advanced

428
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
persistent threats

429
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,279
uh that are going to come after you and

430
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
and there may be faster

431
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,320
and they may have you know good talent

432
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
but there is a way to beat them and just

433
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
like

434
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
when you're an old man trying to play

435
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,959
basketball it's uh you know you've got

436
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,800
to figure out what do you have that

437
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,920
works

438
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
uh one of the big issues in cyber today

439
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,680
is complexity

440
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
you know we have

441
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
one program on top of another program on

442
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
top a number of you just keep spending

443
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
money till you run out of money

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,040
and and you've got 60 different things

445
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
on your network

446
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,639
all trying to do something similar you

447
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,480
know how do you weed out

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
complexity to make the simplicity of

449
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,959
operations

450
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
where you can actually manage it and

451
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
control it that's a very difficult

452
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
subject

453
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
but you've got to know what your talents

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,199
are what you can do and where you can go

455
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,480
um

456
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
ransomware is a big problem

457
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
and and we've been fighting that one you

458
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
know for several years now that people

459
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
became alert wait a minute this can

460
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,040
happen to me

461
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
i want some of that protection

462
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
hp's made a big investment in micro

463
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
virtualization

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,120
and if you're into the nist 800 series

465
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
you can find a good description or a

466
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,399
good definition in 800 213

467
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,079
to talk about micro virtualization and

468
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
so what we've done is we ended up buying

469
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
a company out of cambridge uh england uh

470
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,199
professor at the university of canyon

471
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,520
bridge ian pratt who who

472
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,959
you know i look at ian and say you know

473
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
he's one that knows a lot more than i do

474
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
in this field and i would call him an

475
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,679
expert because he knows more than me

476
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,559
but even ian didn't know it all

477
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,280
but he created a company that we bought

478
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
that throws up uh

479
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
any time you click a link anytime you go

480
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
in a word document or excel document if

481
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
there's malware embedded it's going to

482
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,280
capture it in a micro virtual machine so

483
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
it protects the hardware protects the

484
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
endpoint

485
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
and there's protections for endpoints

486
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
there's protection for networks there's

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,039
protection for cloud there's a whole

488
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
bunch of fields that you have to worry

489
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
about

490
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
to make sure the system has protection

491
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
but ian's

492
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
product is just

493
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,120
it's the perfect recipe i think he told

494
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,799
me last week uh in in the test uh that

495
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,440
we have on machines out there

496
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,799
on the internet there's been eight

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
billion attempts to penetrate uh through

498
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,480
his micro virtualization routines zero

499
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,000
successes

500
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
and you go wow that's great that's

501
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
foolproof but it's not

502
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
somebody's gonna figure out a way around

503
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
it somebody's gonna figure out

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,760
how to beat it it's a time domain that

505
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
you've got to beat don't get satisfied

506
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
that you're doing well and start patting

507
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,200
yourself on the back

508
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
you know you made it to number four this

509
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
year you want to get to number one

510
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,799
but

511
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
you know if you just sit there and pat

512
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
yourself on the back you're going to be

513
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
number 10.

514
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,360
and and so you've got to keep working at

515
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
it and keep investing we uh

516
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
we invest about

517
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
eyes

518
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
several billion dollars a year in

519
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
research at hp

520
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
and of course we're a 60 billion dollar

521
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
company so that's about a five percent

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,919
investment

523
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,919
in research that's probably about

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,240
average if not below average for silicon

525
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,280
valley

526
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
a lot of the new startups are you know a

527
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
lot more than five percent

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
uh because they've got to get off the

529
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
ground and get going at least we've been

530
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
stable and around for 84 years

531
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,400
so we've you know so we've gotten at

532
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,679
least our feet on the ground and know

533
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,200
where we're going

534
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
and uh

535
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,799
if you're not investing if you're not

536
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
putting money into

537
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
the next generation

538
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
you're not going to be around for long

539
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
you certainly aren't going to make it 84

540
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
years you may have short-term gains

541
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,320
but

542
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
you've got to invest for the long haul

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
about half of our investment

544
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,200
is in cyber security uh

545
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
so we have labs all over the world

546
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
uh where we've gotten experts that

547
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,120
collaborate kind of on a 24 7 basis

548
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
uh we work very closely with nist why

549
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
because that's where some of the

550
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,039
smartest people are

551
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,919
uh if not in government in industry in

552
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
academia or working there and i'm glad

553
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,240
to hear uh you're very close and aligned

554
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,720
with what they're doing in this

555
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,880
so it's very good so

556
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
as i said basketball

557
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
a great analogy for the cyber risk

558
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
now i love watching baseball i can't

559
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
play baseball any better than play

560
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,559
basketball it gets better

561
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,159
it's all about being able to see the

562
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,120
ball

563
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
if you don't see the ball you can't hit

564
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,080
the ball

565
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
if you've got a fly ball i've got a

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,039
really bad extinctism

567
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,799
and it it really cuts down on the

568
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,480
three-dimensional vision

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
so i'm kind of seeing a

570
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,480
like you'd see on a flat screen or

571
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
two-dimensional tv

572
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,679
and uh

573
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
and in sports that's not good

574
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
because if you don't you know

575
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,400
if you see the ball was hit i can see

576
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,559
the ball i can hear the ball being hit

577
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
but where it's going i have no clue and

578
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
so you've got to kind of stand there and

579
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
look at the trajectory and then estimate

580
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,440
and go

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,240
i was a terrible baseball player

582
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
but it's just like in cyber

583
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
you've got to see attacks and see them

584
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
coming you've got to anticipate

585
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
you've got to predict where the next

586
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
one's coming

587
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
analyze

588
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
so i've got a background in data science

589
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,919
but back when i studied it you didn't

590
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,679
call it data science

591
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
uh it was in my economics

592
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
degree

593
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
i studied econometrics

594
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,720
not that i really wanted to but the only

595
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,159
thing that fit in my schedule because i

596
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,320
was still working in the pentagon

597
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,159
40 to 60 hours a week and trying to go

598
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,159
to school at nights

599
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,159
and the only classes i could take that

600
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
fit were econometrics and econometrics

601
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
has taken massive amount of big data

602
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
sets and trying to make sense out of

603
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
them and then make predictions on where

604
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
the economies are going

605
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,720
and today

606
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,000
people don't call themselves

607
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
econometricians they realize they'll

608
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,679
make a hundred thousand more a year if

609
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,240
they call themselves a data scientist

610
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,919
so uh so you don't find many

611
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,600
econometricians out there anymore you

612
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,679
find a lot of data scientists

613
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
and that's what i was trying to the math

614
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
the science i used a lot more math

615
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
in my economics degree than i ever did

616
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
in my engineering degree

617
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
because the math and statistics and the

618
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,919
game theory

619
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
uh very very interesting work

620
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,039
but very very applicable to cyber

621
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,159
security

622
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
i would almost say that you know if you

623
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
want to hire somebody with a new

624
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,799
approach to cyber security hire an

625
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
economist who understands game theory

626
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
because in the time domain in the cyber

627
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
war that we're in

628
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,159
game theory really applies

629
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
wouldn't be a bad course for your

630
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,600
students to take

631
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
microeconomics

632
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
not when i was in school but and today

633
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
most of micro courses about half the

634
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
course is about game theory it's about

635
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
how people make decisions

636
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,720
and a very interesting study a very

637
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,240
interesting field

638
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,039
and it applies to cyber security so just

639
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,960
a consideration

640
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
the one thing i could play in sports was

641
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,080
football

642
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,039
uh

643
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,600
i was uh

644
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,159
recruited by a young coach well i take

645
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
that back he was an old coach when i was

646
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
there i was young

647
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,559
to navy

648
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,919
uh my draft number in vietnam war end of

649
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
the war was very high it's number three

650
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,799
it's they

651
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
select your draft by your birth date and

652
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
my birth date was number three on the

653
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,600
list so i just figured

654
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,679
i'm headed to the rice paddies

655
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,480
uh

656
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,200
you know you kind of resign your fate to

657
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
a lottery picks out your birthday

658
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,799
and uh i was sure so i you know got the

659
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,960
call i went to get my physical

660
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
army needed a few good men you know i

661
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
guess that was the marines that need a

662
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
few good men i don't know what the army

663
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
needed but i got the call from army and

664
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
i showed up at the physical and i failed

665
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,559
the physical 4f

666
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
and i'm thinking is that good news is

667
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,960
that bad news you know means i'm not

668
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
going to go in the army

669
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
what am i going to do

670
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
and

671
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
i'd applied for the naval academy

672
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
but with a failed physical i couldn't

673
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,279
get in the naval academy they couldn't

674
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,200
make me an officer

675
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,360
and uh so i signed a scholarship at the

676
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,919
university of tennessee to play football

677
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,960
uh

678
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
and i don't think they knew i couldn't

679
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,360
see

680
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
but i wouldn't i didn't know i couldn't

681
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
see either you just you know as a young

682
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,559
kid you just you just get out on the

683
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
field and play

684
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,679
and in april my senior year uh

685
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,200
coach steve belichick who's a father of

686
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
a coach probably not well liked in this

687
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,080
area

688
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
but

689
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
steve called up and said hey we think

690
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
you can play at navy

691
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,960
i said coach i'd love to but i can't get

692
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,799
in he says what do you mean

693
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
i said well coach my eyesight's really

694
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,360
bad

695
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
he says son i can fix that

696
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
he calls back an hour later he said

697
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,520
you've got a waiver for your eyes then

698
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,799
you got an appointment to the naval

699
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
academy do you want to come

700
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,159
and so it was you know it was really a

701
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,159
an honor i probably shouldn't have gone

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
to the academy if it not been for coach

703
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
belichick so i've been a big patriots

704
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,159
fan for years uh bill was one of my

705
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
coaches there he wasn't a paid coach he

706
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
was just the only son

707
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
of the most experienced coach in navy

708
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,880
and he knew more than any other coaches

709
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
on the on the team

710
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,799
and so i just get yelled at by steve you

711
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
know gardner you can't catch the ball

712
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
you know you got bricks for hands what

713
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,240
are you doing out there uh but bill

714
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
would write you know five pages of every

715
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
play i screwed up and what i was doing

716
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,720
wrong and how to correct

717
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,400
uh kind of like cyber you know you got

718
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
to know what you're doing wrong and you

719
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
got to have a plan for how to correct it

720
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,159
or you're going to keep repeating the

721
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
same mistakes

722
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,120
and i was pretty good at repeating the

723
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,880
same mistakes i wasn't the greatest

724
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
football player but the reason i was on

725
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
the field is i could run i had speed

726
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,840
i had agility uh back in those days

727
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,520
which were the 70s

728
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,960
i could run a 4 5 40 yard dash

729
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
well that's not so great

730
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,320
today

731
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
uh there's guys four three and four four

732
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
out there but i was the fastest guy on

733
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
navy team

734
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
they should have been playing safety but

735
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
since i couldn't see where the football

736
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
was going they ended up putting me in

737
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,559
middle linebacker

738
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,559
much more appropriate

739
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,520
but the speed of action the speed

740
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,400
of reaction to the game

741
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
was the difference between high school

742
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,919
where if you know if you had some basic

743
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
talent size strength

744
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,840
you were able to play

745
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
versus college everybody had size and

746
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,919
strength

747
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,200
but they were fast and versus the pros

748
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
the pros everybody's fast and you know

749
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
the differentiation is very very small

750
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
between the great ones and the pros the

751
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
ones that are just on the team

752
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,360
uh my little brother was six foot eight

753
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,640
320 pound tackle but he could run a four

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
or eight forty

755
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,039
and so he uh was a four-year starter at

756
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,240
georgia tech

757
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,200
which uh is significantly below

758
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,279
purdue on the engineering list but it's

759
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,679
still a pretty good engineering school

760
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,600
and he had a 40 average in electrical

761
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
engineering so he wouldn't have dumped

762
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,840
me and in the pros

763
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,640
you've got to be fast you'll be strong

764
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,720
you've got to be quick but you got to be

765
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,159
smart

766
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,760
you know tom brady didn't get to where

767
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,320
he is in tampa bay now

768
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,520
i've been a dumb athlete he understood

769
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
the defenses are being thrown and he

770
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,279
understood the complexity and it was

771
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,760
able to do the analytics to get call the

772
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
right play and then execute an ability

773
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,039
to execute

774
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,360
so kind of summary

775
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
you know baseball basketball football

776
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
cyber is a sport

777
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
and you should think of it as that one

778
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,440
it is a competition and there are

779
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
adversaries out there that are trying to

780
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
beat you every day

781
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
and you've got to be methodical

782
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
you've got to be quick

783
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
you've got to have speed of reaction

784
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
and you've got to be able to see it

785
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,760
coming see that ball

786
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
see that attack as it's coming and

787
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,840
that's really where we got into xdr

788
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
about yesterday

789
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,919
so uh think about cyber as a competition

790
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,399
and think of it and it you know for the

791
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
student it becomes a lot more fun in the

792
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,240
cyber courses that i teach the

793
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
challenges that i give

794
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,640
uh really have to do with competition

795
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,240
and if you can

796
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,919
you know get those competitive juices

797
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,840
going and think of it in that matter

798
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,640
you're going to be much better off

799
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
all right

800
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,600
so let me talk

801
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
about a number of things and

802
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
i think we've got a

803
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
few minutes and i'll open up for

804
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
questions

805
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
i've got a number of subjects that i can

806
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,640
talk on

807
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
uh some more interesting than others

808
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,120
uh but uh

809
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
you know they all revolve around cyber

810
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
we talked a little about

811
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,080
zero trust and zero trust principles and

812
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,039
the 800 207 publication

813
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,240
uh

814
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,279
the term zero trust came out of forester

815
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,760
paper and i forget the guy's name i've

816
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,279
never met him

817
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,440
but he's still around and the forester

818
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,399
paper

819
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,120
of 2009 where they first used the term

820
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,799
but zero trust principles have been

821
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,440
going on uh much before that

822
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
uh

823
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,200
probably principally in the trusted

824
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,679
computing group tcg

825
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,919
uh which was trying to

826
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,600
go and enforce

827
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,640
a basis of trust for operation it's one

828
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
of the tenets

829
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
of cyber security

830
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,360
and um our first zero trust product

831
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,559
came out in 2004 so five year before the

832
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,760
the term was even used or coined

833
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,159
uh we were using a trusted compute

834
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,120
module

835
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
as a basis of trust

836
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,399
to inform uh what was uh under the

837
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
operating system the bios

838
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
efi

839
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
uh how that was going to operate and how

840
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,559
we could trust the operation

841
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,559
uh we've improved that every year and

842
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,480
that's part of that investment the

843
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
billions of dollars a year we're trying

844
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
to spend to improve

845
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
uh but that's uh

846
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
uh you know gotten a little bit better

847
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
every year

848
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
the products we have

849
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,399
uh are marketing people and i wanted to

850
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,559
point out in the very back of the room

851
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,720
uh ted nelson tad is one of our

852
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
marketing experts

853
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,559
and uh i think he's the one that uh

854
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,919
syria should be talking to about a

855
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
stronger relationship between hp and

856
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,600
this institution so i'm going to

857
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,159
publicly recommend it to you ted it's

858
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,159
they're doing well here

859
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,159
but uh the marketing people call it the

860
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,000
sure

861
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,399
family of products that we have

862
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,720
the sure click which is

863
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
uh what i explained about the micro

864
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,600
virtualization

865
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
the sure run

866
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,000
the sure recovery

867
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
uh and those more

868
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,399
have to do with uh cryptographic chip

869
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,720
that stores our bios that we write it's

870
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,559
not a commercial bios we write our own

871
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,919
bios we hold the the code of that bios

872
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,320
closer than coca-cola holds their secret

873
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,120
formula it is well protected i don't

874
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,080
know what it is i can make some educated

875
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,519
guesses

876
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,679
but you know it is i don't have the need

877
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,399
to know

878
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
it's well protected

879
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
uh but it's encrypted on a cryptographic

880
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
chip and then within two seconds

881
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,760
randomly

882
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
but no more than two seconds the

883
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,320
cryptographic chip hash

884
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
of what should be in the bios is

885
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,960
validated against what's in memory that

886
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,799
is operating the system in the bias

887
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,200
and if it's not correct the memory is

888
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,559
flushed

889
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,440
and the bios is reinserted from the

890
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
trusted

891
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,679
computer module for the

892
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,760
of the uh the chip

893
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,600
and and so

894
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
you know

895
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,640
that if somebody's going to get in

896
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,919
and hit you

897
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,679
they got to change things

898
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,240
and do it within two seconds which is

899
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,440
possible

900
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
but we we've yet to be able the marine

901
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
corps wanted us to test this we couldn't

902
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
really devise a test of how to break

903
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
into without breaking the system to

904
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,399
start with so what's the test when you

905
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,760
shut it down

906
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,159
what are you really testing and they got

907
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,679
a little frustrated but

908
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,360
you know it works

909
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,200
and uh and zero trust is really uh

910
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,559
basis of that

911
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,559
at the end of the day it's all about

912
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,399
the money how much are you willing to

913
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,480
invest

914
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
if the investment

915
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,640
is not

916
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
at the level you want

917
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
then you have to argue

918
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,360
to the ceo or to the chief financial

919
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,399
officer

920
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
why you need more funding

921
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,440
and uh

922
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
and i think

923
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,039
at hp it's been very easy because

924
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,279
if we don't produce the world's most

925
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,399
secure

926
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,600
printers computers workstations

927
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,240
and even 3d print we're not going to be

928
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
in business we won't make it another 84

929
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,760
years

930
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
we'll be out of business so when we say

931
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,399
we need more money to invest in

932
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,399
and you make your case

933
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
uh the check's there

934
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,960
which is which is really easy

935
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
3d print a lot of our competitors

936
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,039
we see at trade shows

937
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,039
and i ask how do you protect

938
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,640
the files

939
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,320
now what's your cyber security

940
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
protections on your machines

941
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
we treat them just like a printer

942
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
or a workstation it's the same

943
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,320
architecture for our 3d printers

944
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,159
you know the the trusted compute the

945
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
zero trust principles go into our 3d

946
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,399
print

947
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,679
and uh and why because well

948
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
it becomes a way of life it becomes a

949
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
principle of design you know the first

950
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
principle is you know ford it was

951
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
quality is job one

952
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
at hp it's security is job one we've got

953
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,799
to make secure products

954
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
and a lot of competitors say oh we don't

955
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,760
we don't have to worry about cyber

956
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,039
security

957
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,399
and i thought well that's interesting

958
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,240
why well we're not connected to the

959
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,600
internet

960
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,359
well that's interesting

961
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,359
and how do you get your files from the

962
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,639
design

963
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,480
to the machine

964
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,839
simple we use a usb thumb drive

965
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,679
that's secure

966
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,560
well

967
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,960
iranians didn't think so

968
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,639
they figured that one out

969
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,839
and uh

970
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,719
and and there's ways you could test the

971
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
thumb drive and validate that it is

972
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,839
secure and you i mean it's not that it's

973
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,359
impossible but in the future

974
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,839
that data on that machine is going to be

975
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,399
used as a pedigree

976
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,639
or for the park it's going to be part of

977
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,520
what you need to show the supply chain

978
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
that this is the bill of material for a

979
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,679
hardware bill of material that started

980
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,239
with the pedigree for the file

981
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,800
that was hashed and validated before it

982
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
went on the machine validated before you

983
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,359
started producing the part

984
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,480
and it becomes a trusted

985
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
file and a trust that if we use this

986
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
file we know what it produced it's going

987
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,359
to produce the same thing every time so

988
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,280
we know what the quality is

989
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
and if this

990
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,200
part goes into an airplane or maybe a

991
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,880
submarine

992
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,839
we can

993
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,520
pretty much validate that it's not going

994
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
to

995
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,800
fail within certain parameters and that

996
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
you can use it a certain amount of times

997
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,839
or it needs to be maintained certain

998
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,400
periodicity and uh

999
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
and the people will be safe

1000
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,520
the the difference between i.t

1001
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
which

1002
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,800
we deal with in hp

1003
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
and ot or operational technologies is

1004
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
that an i.t you can lose data you can

1005
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,880
use intellectual property

1006
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,560
you can shut down

1007
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,960
operations of communication

1008
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,400
but in ot industrial control systems

1009
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
people can get hurt

1010
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,119
i mean seriously her and uh you know

1011
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,160
things

1012
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,920
can can go boom

1013
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
and and explode or components can shut

1014
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
down if

1015
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
some of these things uh

1016
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,839
my favorite scenario is is the uh

1017
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,599
refineries i think we have 163

1018
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,920
refineries in the us

1019
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,680
a lot of them use common design and

1020
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
common parts

1021
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,280
but if you could hack into refineries

1022
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
and let's say

1023
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,200
some black swan event where you're able

1024
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,079
to hack into 163 all at once

1025
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,440
and break

1026
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,880
a major component within the refinery

1027
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,320
you'd shut down the highways of america

1028
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,240
we can't ship enough

1029
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,960
refined petroleum over here

1030
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
to keep the automobiles and trucks

1031
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,599
running

1032
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,680
and here in the midwest you you probably

1033
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,839
see enough trucks on the highway you

1034
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,839
know that is the

1035
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,280
that is the

1036
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,480
blood of the american economies those

1037
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
trucking companies that are getting

1038
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,320
goods from one side of the country to

1039
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,839
the other and stopping everywhere in

1040
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,040
between

1041
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,200
uh so could you devise

1042
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,280
a program that does that

1043
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,839
i don't think it'd take too much

1044
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,000
imagination the execution is what you're

1045
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
working and what is the protection

1046
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,000
that refineries have

1047
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
against the cyber attack

1048
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
now the bikes are pretty good if you

1049
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
want to learn about cyber you go talk to

1050
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,720
the banks

1051
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
why there's incentive there an economic

1052
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,520
incentive to protect those finances

1053
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,400
uh

1054
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,200
in

1055
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
refineries it's kind of like well

1056
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
they're not interested in us nobody's

1057
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,800
going to hurt us we don't need to spend

1058
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,920
that much

1059
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,040
the the

1060
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,200
attitude the culture

1061
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,520
isn't there for cyber protections it's

1062
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
best i know

1063
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
and some of you that work in the oil and

1064
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,599
gas field

1065
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,760
probably have a closer uh feel for it

1066
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
than i do

1067
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,520
but uh you know i've had this discussion

1068
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,720
with sysa it's in one of their 16 uh

1069
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,680
risk areas for critical infrastructure

1070
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,079
and uh and so they're thinking about it

1071
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,040
but it gets back to priorities

1072
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,960
as i said yesterday it's unfortunate you

1073
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,680
can only spend each dollar once

1074
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
i had a boss at the office in naval

1075
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,720
research

1076
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
anybody that would come in to see him

1077
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,760
the admiral would say i'll fund that

1078
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
and i'd have to go in after and say well

1079
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
what the admiral really meant

1080
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,480
is he would fund it if he had the money

1081
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
we don't have the money

1082
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,200
you can only spend it once

1083
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
admiral didn't understand that he he

1084
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
wanted to do everything if it was a good

1085
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,520
idea he wanted to put money on it

1086
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
but you have to weigh those and that's

1087
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,720
really what the risk management

1088
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
framework's about that this has proposed

1089
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,920
to me that's common sense

1090
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,440
that we should have been doing that all

1091
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
along and probably most companies have

1092
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,400
been

1093
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,680
but it's still

1094
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,760
you can only spend so much

1095
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,320
and dedicated so much to expenditures

1096
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,040
that's just the way it goes

1097
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,119
all right

1098
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
i told you about micro virtualization

1099
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,880
the thing we're working on now is tamper

1100
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,119
proofing and uh you know capabilities of

1101
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
uh mentioned yesterday

1102
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,359
taking your different components and

1103
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,599
making sure that they sum up

1104
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,800
in a hash that if anybody's added

1105
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,440
subtracted or changed

1106
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,880
you're going to get a message and the

1107
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,640
machine won't boot

1108
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
uh other ways to know if they open up

1109
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
the box if you have light sensors in

1110
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
there

1111
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
detect photons

1112
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
it's going to kick you out and go

1113
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,359
hey wait a minute somebody's been inside

1114
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,160
here was this anticipated did you plan

1115
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,839
that now most of the machines you don't

1116
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,200
have to open the box particularly

1117
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,800
laptops is just not required

1118
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,520
so that's some interesting work

1119
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,040
we're trying to work on reducing the

1120
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,320
complexity

1121
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,599
our supply chain is recognized uh at

1122
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,520
least for the last five years we've been

1123
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
in the top 20.

1124
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,440
i think two years ago we were number

1125
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
seven in the world

1126
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,480
this year i think we're number 12.

1127
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,440
so it's

1128
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
not as good as purdue it's the u.s

1129
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,760
news and world report

1130
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,000
but this is of all companies in all

1131
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,119
markets

1132
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,880
globally not just the u.s so uh we're

1133
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,640
very proud of that we're very proud of

1134
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,240
the supply chain

1135
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,119
we have 10 000 plus vendors that we deal

1136
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,000
with

1137
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,720
and the way you become good in the

1138
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
supply chain you have to know your

1139
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
vendors you have to do due diligence you

1140
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
have to

1141
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,599
go visit their sites and not just the

1142
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,920
people that you deal with but the people

1143
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
that they deal with

1144
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
and so it multiplies quite rapidly with

1145
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,800
10 000 people supplying us

1146
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,680
and then we look at alternatives because

1147
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,800
if a pandemic comes and one vendor goes

1148
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
under or they don't have the people that

1149
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,079
they used to have because they're all

1150
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,400
homesick

1151
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,839
where do you go uh our engineering or

1152
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,680
not engineering leadership team our

1153
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,560
executive leadership team the elt

1154
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,359
uh

1155
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,200
last year they spent about half of their

1156
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,319
time

1157
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,720
working supply chain issues

1158
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,560
now five years ago i don't know how much

1159
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,000
they spent on the supply chain but it

1160
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,839
certainly wasn't half

1161
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,359
maybe 10

1162
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,280
maybe i i don't know

1163
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,359
but you know it became a focus because

1164
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,880
it had to be it was a business necessity

1165
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,960
uh and in the supply chain the issues of

1166
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,680
the digital supply chain because today

1167
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
every part of the supply chain has

1168
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,880
digital components

1169
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,079
and how do you

1170
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,839
how do you put together a digital supply

1171
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,960
chain

1172
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,760
well

1173
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,880
uh

1174
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
this is the textbook i use

1175
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
uh in my class on the digital supply

1176
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,079
chain

1177
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,440
it's a german

1178
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,240
uh

1179
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
goats wierberg

1180
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,359
wrote it he was an sap

1181
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,119
executive

1182
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,720
i don't think here he's anymore i think

1183
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,400
he's teaching now but

1184
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,480
a very insightful

1185
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,359
way of how you take an erp system

1186
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
and use that to make decisions in your

1187
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,280
supply chain well that's kind of what an

1188
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,839
erp resource management program is

1189
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,599
supposed to do

1190
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,520
but very insightful the do's and the

1191
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,000
dots and the common eras and the culture

1192
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,079
you need and he talks about the

1193
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,760
the insect community of ants and bees

1194
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,560
and he makes analogy between how ant

1195
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,200
community they all specialize but they

1196
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,680
all communicate and everybody knows the

1197
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
function they're providing

1198
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
similar to the b community and how that

1199
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
applies to securing a digital supply

1200
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,079
chain

1201
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,280
anyway i encourage you to read the book

1202
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,119
i won't you know give you the whole

1203
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,720
story here i'll let you wonder on your

1204
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,680
own

1205
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,599
you can probably figure it out it's not

1206
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,319
that revolutionary that's just very

1207
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,040
interesting the biological connections

1208
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,520
to cyber security we are working on

1209
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,720
those

1210
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,839
right now there are a lot of analogies

1211
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,760
but there's also some connections you

1212
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,240
can make

1213
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,359
i've got a whole bunch of things i could

1214
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,880
cover but the one i want to leave you

1215
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
with

1216
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,839
is is something that i'm working really

1217
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,319
hard on in the quantum field

1218
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,760
uh and it's not building the next

1219
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,520
quantum computer you think hp would be

1220
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,839
involved with that we're not i think

1221
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,359
we're still a few years from that but

1222
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,480
that has

1223
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,119
a big problem with uh

1224
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,280
the intelligence community

1225
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,520
if you can build a quantum computer

1226
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
theoretically

1227
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,440
would be able to hack

1228
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,000
shaw 256 algorithm

1229
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,079
that's protecting a lot of data

1230
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,480
not in a hundred years of brute force

1231
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,800
hacking that was originally designed by

1232
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,160
this to do

1233
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,240
but do it within four hours

1234
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,200
and

1235
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,119
depending on the computer maybe four

1236
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,079
minutes

1237
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,240
and so anything you've encrypted and

1238
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,040
think

1239
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
my data at rest is protected because

1240
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,760
i've encrypted it with the sha-256

1241
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,720
uh all of a sudden is vulnerable maybe

1242
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,119
as soon as you print it out

1243
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,480
uh it's it's so the quantum compute is a

1244
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,079
risk and it's something we need to know

1245
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
and understand uh nist is working real

1246
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,800
hard on quantum resistant

1247
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,160
algorithms

1248
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,319
that could help

1249
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,319
and they looked at i think 70

1250
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,119
alternatives necked it down to 25

1251
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,760
they will probably select three or four

1252
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
so in case they weren't right on the

1253
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
first one they've got backups they could

1254
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,720
go to

1255
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,400
and that has happened before i think

1256
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,240
elliptical curve is one of those methods

1257
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
that it's hackable

1258
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
and it's uh you can penetrate uh one of

1259
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,599
the intelligence experts i know was

1260
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,640
whining about the chinese are so stupid

1261
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
you know they're downloading all this

1262
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,240
encrypted data

1263
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
what in the world don't they understand

1264
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,680
this is encrypted stuff it's no good to

1265
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,800
them

1266
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680
well

1267
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,839
maybe it's no good today

1268
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,680
or maybe

1269
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,079
uh they're storing it so when they get a

1270
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,839
quantum computer they can go read

1271
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,319
everything we did like a history book

1272
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,880
and all secrets are now open

1273
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,720
or maybe

1274
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
just maybe

1275
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,560
maybe they have a quantum computer and

1276
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,720
didn't tell anybody about

1277
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,400
now if our intelligence community had a

1278
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,040
quantum computer that could un

1279
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,200
lock any encryption

1280
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,319
do you think they're going to tell us

1281
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,680
about it

1282
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,200
i don't think the general public would

1283
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,240
know

1284
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,160
i think it would be a closely guarded

1285
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,560
secret in the intelligence community

1286
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,319
i don't have any thoughts that they

1287
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
actually have that

1288
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
i don't know about the chinese but if

1289
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,880
they're downloading things that are

1290
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
valuable right away

1291
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,880
you know i'd be concerned so the field

1292
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,160
of quantum something concerned with but

1293
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,920
our interest is in quantum information

1294
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,119
science

1295
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,800
and so where is that going and what is

1296
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,440
that involved uh there's quantum key

1297
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,040
distribution

1298
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
uh a company that i

1299
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,200
have known for years

1300
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,280
came out of tennessee at oak ridge

1301
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,599
they're now in carlsbad california and

1302
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,200
they have a device that can make a

1303
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,680
single photon and you can use a single

1304
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
photon as a digit it's zero or one

1305
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,760
depending on the polarity is it

1306
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,440
horizontal or vertically oriented most

1307
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
people have sunglasses and they

1308
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,359
understand polarization

1309
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,880
and so the sunglasses are either

1310
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
horizontal or vertically polarized

1311
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,200
so you don't get but half the light

1312
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,560
through

1313
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,160
you can use that as a key distribution

1314
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,000
they're actually making money selling

1315
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,079
this to utilities is protecting scada

1316
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,200
devices

1317
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,640
uh but the

1318
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,599
quantum

1319
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,440
true random number generator there's a

1320
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,720
company getting ready to come out with

1321
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,920
one of those

1322
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,079
uh has a real implication on security

1323
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,760
because today's encryption uses

1324
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,920
pseudo-random number generators

1325
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,359
in pseudo-random number generators

1326
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,960
potentially hackable

1327
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,480
so you use a true random number

1328
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,560
generator and there's some techniques

1329
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,480
you can go through to say this is how

1330
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,720
they do it

1331
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,400
it's being proven right now at a

1332
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,800
laboratory at a university they're very

1333
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,880
sensitive about where and who and where

1334
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
but it's i'm sure if you follow the

1335
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,400
research you can find it

1336
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
that's problematic and then quantum

1337
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,040
memory is out there uh the quantum

1338
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,400
internet is the one that i'm most

1339
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
excited about there's some work at

1340
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,319
university of chicago doe funded

1341
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,319
that is going on that's going to be very

1342
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,920
very interesting work

1343
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,040
and

1344
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,640
and there's a city

1345
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,000
in this country that wants to be a

1346
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,800
leader in the quantum internet

1347
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,560
now is it going to take off it's going

1348
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,160
to go i don't know it's

1349
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
it's like in research

1350
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,079
my principal job at the office of naval

1351
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,800
research was to take promising work and

1352
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
research and get it out of the lab and

1353
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,400
put it into the navy

1354
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,839
researchers don't like to do that they

1355
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,440
like to work with their project as long

1356
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,040
as possible

1357
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
so

1358
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,400
uh so i'd encourage you to keep track of

1359
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,800
the quantum field and i

1360
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,599
could give our lectures on it but uh i

1361
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,960
think it's probably more to learn on

1362
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
your own i will recommend philip ball's

1363
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,319
book

1364
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,440
professor out of oxford weird science

1365
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
and he takes without a single equation

1366
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,400
can i explain the concepts

1367
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,280
so i know you'd rather have equations

1368
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,559
so would i

1369
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,559
but the concepts are are easy to

1370
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,960
understand you don't need a phd in

1371
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,240
physics

1372
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,559
so i'll stop here

1373
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,119
and uh open the four for questions

1374
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,720
discussions i should be here the rest

1375
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
afternoon if you want to uh chat on any

1376
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,200
specific topic if i cover or anything

1377
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
that i haven't covered

1378
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,040
so

1379
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,599
we can take a limited number of

1380
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,559
questions here if anybody has any um

1381
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,200
otherwise we will

1382
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,760
i can tell c stories for a while

1383
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
based on the um

1384
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,599
on the part of the theme or at least the

1385
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,480
beginning of his talk uh we can go to

1386
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,400
half time but but joel will uh perfect

1387
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,240
uh tommy thank you very much

1388
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,920
the panel that is going to be following

1389
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,200
you is on software security and software

1390
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,880
building materials i know that you

1391
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,720
specifically have chaired some committee

1392
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,079
in this area yeah do you have some

1393
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,559
comments to maybe uh set the stage for

1394
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,160
our next panel since this is your

1395
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,319
founder i you know i actually

1396
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,680
didn't want to tip their hand at the

1397
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,160
next panel but i i'm focused on the

1398
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,400
hardware bill of material in my working

1399
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,839
group at

1400
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,160
cisa's

1401
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,880
supply chain risk management task force

1402
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
and there is uh sherry caddy who you met

1403
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,720
at the

1404
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,760
cymani conference doe leader for caesar

1405
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,520
which is their cyber security effort at

1406
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,960
doe

1407
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
she leads the software bill of material

1408
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,400
work and does a really good job

1409
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,839
and so we're trying to coordinate to

1410
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,599
make sure that the software is much

1411
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,960
harder problem

1412
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
in hardware we're trying to figure out

1413
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,880
you know where it was designed where it

1414
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,119
was made how it was tested

1415
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,880
and and it gets into a labeling criteria

1416
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,240
and there's efforts in the federal

1417
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,079
government now to require labeling of

1418
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,920
electronic products

1419
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,440
that would give you an information

1420
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,520
singapore is doing it now the singapore

1421
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,920
method has five different levels of

1422
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,599
cyber protection

1423
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,280
and it gives the consumer an idea

1424
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,839
without understanding anything about

1425
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,680
cyber that if they're two products both

1426
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,280
at the same price

1427
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,280
one has a level one and one has a level

1428
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,559
five

1429
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:05,920
would i pay

1430
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,240
the same amount to get better cyber

1431
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,440
protection

1432
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,280
well from a decision theory point of

1433
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,640
view or a game theory point of view

1434
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,400
that's an easy choice

1435
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,960
if it's the same price you pay more but

1436
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,359
if it's a different price how much more

1437
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,960
are you willing to pay

1438
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,240
well that's the decision for the

1439
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,040
consumer for the industry and so you

1440
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,119
kind of do those trade-offs

1441
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,280
and uh not that it's perfect and not

1442
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,000
that each product is evaluated fairly or

1443
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,200
the same

1444
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,119
but in theory it you know it gives you a

1445
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,559
relative feel

1446
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,640
for how your product stacks up against

1447
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
competitors from a cyber security

1448
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,880
standpoint now what are the metrics of

1449
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,559
cyber well it depends

1450
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,880
you know what if what if you define a

1451
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,720
cyber security space

1452
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,119
there's another three lectures on

1453
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,960
definitions of cyber

1454
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,960
uh but um

1455
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,319
you know once you defined it once you

1456
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,920
said this is what we're going to do the

1457
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,359
process and this is how we're going to

1458
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,760
evaluate it and these are the evaluation

1459
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,079
points for your product

1460
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,240
you can come up with some answers crude

1461
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,599
they may be

1462
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,599
but it gives you a relative feeling and

1463
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,520
i think we're going to go to labeling

1464
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,200
but it's going to be on the basis of

1465
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,599
what your hardware and software bill of

1466
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,040
materials say

1467
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
and software oh gee

1468
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,960
you know you want to know where the

1469
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,920
software came from well who wrote it

1470
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,040
how many

1471
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,920
pieces of code now are just robo-created

1472
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,839
you know they're generated by an

1473
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,880
algorithm

1474
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,960
you know this is what i want to do well

1475
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
in java you do it this way

1476
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,160
python here or you do this

1477
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,599
you know but

1478
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,440
the person writing the code was the one

1479
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
who wrote the you know here's what you

1480
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,680
do for this function and the writing

1481
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,520
function blocks then our code's

1482
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,640
appropriate

1483
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,160
but you go back to any of these codes

1484
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,280
java or even c plus they all go back to

1485
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,280
machine language who wrote the machine

1486
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,319
language curve that went into python

1487
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,680
well you could probably trace some of

1488
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,160
that out but if you want to know where

1489
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,599
it was written

1490
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,680
and who had the access or the creativity

1491
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,720
uh a lot of that is lost in space

1492
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,040
and uh you know people got the high

1493
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,440
order languages because it was time

1494
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,160
consuming and costly to code in machine

1495
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,359
language

1496
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,400
so

1497
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,800
anyway that's uh thanks for the question

1498
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
joel

1499
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,680
all right we are

1500
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,960
going to resume uh on the hour but first

1501
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,839
let's thank our speaker

1502
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,920
glad to be here

1503
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,400
he touched on a number of important

1504
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,559
topics and

1505
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,079
i note that he said he'll be here for a

1506
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,599
while so if you want to follow up on

1507
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,480
some of those you can do so perhaps over

1508
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,280
coffee or tea in the back

1509
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,240
purdue has a a significant group working

1510
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,160
in quantum by the way

1511
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,880
and our next panel in fact is is kind of

1512
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,760
quantum uh they may or may not be up

1513
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,920
there on the the diocese you can't tell

1514
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,079
until you try to observe them

1515
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,040
uh

1516
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,839
but

1517
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,599
we're not going to collapse the state

1518
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,319
until uh uh one or two minutes past the

1519
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,559
hour so enjoy your break and we'll see

1520
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,720
you then

1521
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,960
you
