1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,800
good afternoon i hope everybody had a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,080
great lunch

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,120
um

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,160
uh

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,320
professor zhu and i went over and had a

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,880
separate side lunch with some university

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,320
visitors that

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
uh were here on campus

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,880
uh but not to come to this and when they

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
found out that the serious symposium was

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
going on they are going to be joining us

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,600
for some of the sessions later but

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,199
they're touring other areas of the

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,480
conference but

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,680
um

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,480
as many of you know sirius operates sort

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,279
of as a pseudo consortium that we have

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,680
strategic partners and many of you in

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
the audience are connected to our

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
strategic partners and sit on our board

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,879
but

22
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,360
this was in our day this was a good this

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
was a good lunch because uh

24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
caci

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
is on campus just said we're in so we're

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
now adding our 23rd

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
partner to our to our consortium so

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
they'll be joining our board meeting so

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
very excited to announce another one

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,879
but this whole lunch reminded me that we

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,640
actually didn't do a formal thank you to

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
any of our partners so it's up here on

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
the uh on the uh the the placard and i

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,479
do know that they're being recognized in

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,479
the slides but i formally want to say

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
thank you to all of our strategic

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
partners who are in the room

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
uh with posting this uh that this is a

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
cyber security conference and it's out

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
there on the web we get phone calls all

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,759
the time typically from from dot com uh

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
organizations within cyber security said

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
we'd like to sponsor your conference and

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,640
i say there's only one way to sponsor

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
our conferences become one of our

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
strategic partners because we're always

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
trying to push value back to them and

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,240
and i'm we're not all that excited and

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,600
somebody paying five grand to get their

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
name on a plaque here

51
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
i'd much rather build partnership so

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
thank you again to all of our current

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,759
partners and any organization that is

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,520
not one of our strategic partners we're

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,479
happy to discuss what that all entails

56
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,360
so

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
moving along uh this will be our first

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,640
technical talk uh of the conference

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
and you'll see as i mentioned this

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
morning we are interdisciplinary so we

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
look for leading uh research mature

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,840
research in various departments and i'm

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
super excited

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,639
i had the opportunity to to sit down

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,520
with in his very first semester here at

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
purdue and uh when they'd recruit him up

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
here to the polytechnic and he started

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
telling me about his research and the

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
light bulbs just kept going along about

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,400
the things he could work on

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
and so

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
he and he participated in one of the

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
panels a year or two years ago two years

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,400
ago

75
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
three i guess three years ago okay

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
uh but his research is at the point and

77
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
the schedule allowed that i'm super

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,519
excited to be able to invite him to

79
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
share his research these are supposed to

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
be tidbits he's not going to give you

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
the deep dive but he's going to give you

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
enough that you're going to want to seek

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
him out later and learn more about that

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
so with that umit kerbick from the

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
polytechnic it's all yours thank you

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,959
joel

87
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,720
thanks everyone for coming to the talk

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
today um

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,000
i think there are two times that are the

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
worst times giving a presentation just

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
before the lunch and after the lunch

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
and i got one of them so

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,879
okay um so but i'll i'll try to keep it

94
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
as you know like broad as possible so

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
i'll be happy to talk about you know

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
these some of the projects that i've

97
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
been working on

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
with you individually or as a group

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,440
together um so you're welcome to discuss

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
so my name is amit karabik i'm a i'm an

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,599
assistant professor in the computer

102
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,959
information technology department at

103
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
polytechnic here at purdue and i'm also

104
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
directing my ubiquitous and mobile

105
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,319
investigative techniques and

106
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,959
technologies lab

107
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,159
so

108
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,440
in our lab we do actually

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
seriously work in interdisciplinary work

110
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
and also

111
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
multidisciplinary work and what we

112
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
dedicate ourselves in this lab you know

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
pursuit of digital understanding it is

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
very important for us so that we can you

115
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
know help others and also safeguarding

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
and advocating the user security and

117
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
privacy as well as the advancement of

118
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
digital and cyber forensics

119
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
and in our research in general what we

120
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
try to do is we identify we analyze we

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
expose the you know the flaws and and

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
abuses and technologies the goal is here

123
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
really to educate the end users as well

124
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
as help forensic investigators

125
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
particularly in law enforcement

126
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
so we work hand in hand with the help

127
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
law enforcement in most of the projects

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
so as an outline of my research today

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,798
what i'm going to be talking about is

130
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,120
what is digital forensics and what is it

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
it isn't so it's very important to a

132
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
little bit touch on this topic

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
and some of the challenges that are

134
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
being you know

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
addressed or faced by the forensic

136
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
investigators and forensic intelligence

137
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
how it can be integrated into forensics

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
and digital forensics procedure like

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
contemporary digital forensics

140
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
procedures as well as the other way

141
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,040
around how

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
the

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
digital forensics can be incorporated

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
into intelligence services

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
and also some of the applied projects

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,560
that i've been working on

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
so what is digital forensics well

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
probably this is it isn't digital

149
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
forensics that's what people think

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
that's what why people learn forensics

151
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,680
right from the csi movies and all these

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,560
you know episodes i mean um actually one

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
of the youtube videos i wasn't sure if i

154
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,919
can actually run the youtube video like

155
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,720
16 seconds um it's actually teaching us

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
that we can actually catch

157
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,080
the hackers

158
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
by tracing their ip addresses

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
just by creating a gui interface using

160
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
visual basic so that's what being

161
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
covered in this you know video

162
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
so um so let's go back what is digital

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,720
forensics right so digital forensics um

164
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
the procedure itself was very well

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
defined by the former director of

166
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
defense computer forensics laboratory

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,039
can

168
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
that equal i guess last name

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,080
so he defined this very well

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
and if you focus on some of the you know

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
points that it's for sure it's an

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,759
application of computer science but we

173
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
can actually call it now it's computing

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
sciences really it's more than you know

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
purely computer science anymore

176
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
and it's the goal is really to you know

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,880
um collect evidence or evidentiary the

178
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
the data that has evidentiary value but

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
what is really important in this

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,520
procedure is to have a search authority

181
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,319
following the chain of custody and also

182
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
using the validation techniques with

183
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
mathematics hash functions

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
and also um you know using the validated

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
tools making sure

186
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
every single procedure and process and

187
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
findings can be repeated by others by

188
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,680
following the same procedures

189
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
and at the end reporting and expert

190
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,639
testimony if possible so this is a you

191
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
know traditionally known procedure for

192
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
digital forensics and as you can see

193
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,759
it's simply csi without blood we don't

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,440
really deal with blood

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
but is it really true i mean it's not

196
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
really exactly you know the case because

197
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
now digital forensics

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
as a

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
under the forensic science

200
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
on discipline it is so much integrated

201
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
with other disciplines as well and we do

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
actually sometimes have to take into the

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
the physical evidence like blood or dna

204
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
or fingerprint into account because they

205
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
might be found in digital devices

206
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
and also they might help to unlock

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
digital devices so they are all now

208
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
integrated so thinking this as a that's

209
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
why my topic was the holistic view or

210
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,880
holistic approach we have to you know

211
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
think about the

212
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
other forensic sciences all together and

213
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
and and think about as an

214
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
interdisciplinary um you know area

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,800
so what isn't digital forensics is quite

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,919
a bit confused is data recovery in in

217
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,880
the disaster recovery so well can

218
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
digital forensics be used for this

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
purpose of course it can be used but

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
it's not really exactly this

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,199
but

222
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520
again there's an intersection here

223
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,919
for some of the agencies

224
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
it is not really necessary to follow

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
hardcore digital forensics procedures

226
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
right and these are particularly the

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
agencies dealing with more intelligence

228
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
gathering and collecting more

229
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,840
information about you know certain

230
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,400
threats and mitigating certain threats

231
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
and for those agencies digital forensics

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
sometimes mean really data recovery and

233
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
disaster recovery and we actually

234
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
covered this part

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
also in our

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
one of the projects

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,879
so digital forensics

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
procedure is a very well defined again

239
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
and nist publication 800 101 this is a

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
special publication and it actually very

241
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
well defines the procedure that needs to

242
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,759
be followed in order to in order for any

243
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,279
evidence being admissible in the court

244
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,240
of law

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
so the first step is you know

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
identifying the evidence acquiring the

247
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
evidence and protecting the evidence so

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
this could be a digital you know

249
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,040
hardware and then some data inside that

250
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
hardware as well located in the hardware

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
and eventually what we do after we

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
acquire the you know data we process it

253
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
the process you know uh second step is

254
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
the processing stage or it's another

255
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
words called examination stage the goal

256
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
is really reduce the number of amount of

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
data or amount of data to the manageable

258
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,959
size it's also called triaging and and

259
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,519
it has different names for really for

260
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,640
different

261
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,720
uh investigators it could be public

262
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
private or even you know um intelligence

263
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
community

264
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
and

265
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
the next stage is analysis stage or

266
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,920
analyzing the data the goal is really

267
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,600
here to having the best information or

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
gathering or collecting best information

269
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,560
after you know reducing the the amount

270
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
of data to the smaller um you know a

271
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
month and you get the useful data out of

272
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
this and eventually the reporting phase

273
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
shows all the analysis results

274
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
so the goal

275
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
for any of the forensic procedure

276
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
it could be forensic intelligence it

277
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
could be digital forensics

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
procedures it's really answered you know

279
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
5w or

280
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,519
5w 1h or 6ws

281
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
you know simply answering the question

282
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
when where why who what and how

283
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
but the question is how we can really

284
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
you know answer all of these questions

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
well sometimes easy it's as easy as we

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
use some tools we you know

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
feed the data or or we call it image of

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
the data most of the time into the

289
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
system and it just you know simply shows

290
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
us some of the

291
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
doesn't work

292
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
some of the you know uh information in

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
some form of course like timestamps in

294
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
epoch style epoch time and you know

295
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
in plain text text messages this is one

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
of the

297
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
research findings from an application on

298
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
a mobile device it's as easy as this but

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
sometimes we just a little bit dig into

300
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
the data and look at the logs and you

301
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,399
know some of the information and find

302
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
some more information in the logs

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
so this

304
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
might be easy sometimes might be

305
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
challenging

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
but there is an approach is always being

307
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,160
followed is following the lowest hanging

308
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
fruit

309
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
in the forensic procedures like

310
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
usually the tools we use they show us

311
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
nicely you know categorized evidence is

312
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
being found on the target device and

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
then say oh if you are interested in the

314
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
pictures or photos look at here if

315
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,240
you're interested in emails look at

316
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
there so but again the data is not

317
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
always there we just have to think

318
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
from various different aspects not only

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,839
being depending on one tool one approach

320
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,320
we need to think you know holistically

321
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
and there are some techniques that be is

322
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
are being used for this one of them is

323
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
pattern of life technique it can be used

324
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
actually to understand

325
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
the the for the data from various

326
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
different

327
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,880
you know perspectives and aspects we can

328
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
understand better understand the data

329
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,880
and what the data is telling us

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
rather than what's being shown by the

331
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
tools

332
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
so one example here from this data

333
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
actually when you do the analysis

334
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
this is a

335
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
some data sources from from an iphone

336
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,639
device it could be you know some health

337
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
related data and we can collect the

338
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
floors distance steps heart rate but how

339
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
are they going to be integrated into the

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
forensic investigation and how are they

341
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
going to be useful for forensic

342
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
investigation it's a really thinking

343
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
process the investigators should take

344
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
into account some other you know aspects

345
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,959
some other data and actually

346
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
not only focusing on what the tool tells

347
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,920
them

348
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
they need to think about how this data

349
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
can tell them other stories about some

350
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,440
of the data might be found in somewhere

351
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
else like for instance one example

352
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
um

353
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,959
if there's any suspect

354
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
is suspected to do you know plan a like

355
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,680
bombing or some some terrorist attacks

356
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
and their phone is being seized and if

357
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
the phone is analyzed and obviously text

358
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,360
messages are analyzed and there is

359
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
nothing in the text messages it's the

360
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
lowest hanging fruit it's right there

361
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,920
text messages

362
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,560
and some one of these categories text

363
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
messages are there and then you look at

364
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
there it's not there

365
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
but there are some certain structures

366
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
like write ahead logs or some other you

367
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
know structures that every single typed

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,639
and then erased content might be

369
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
actually found in those contents so it

370
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
doesn't necessarily tell

371
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,399
the whatever they have you know they

372
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,560
have written and then delete it doesn't

373
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
necessarily dictate that this person

374
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
actually is a criminal or you know have

375
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,360
been

376
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,160
uh performing some criminal activities

377
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,399
but it might tell some information what

378
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
was the intention initially you know

379
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
what were they planning because all of

380
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,000
those drafts

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
in every second some in different

382
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
intervals might be stored somewhere else

383
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
so all of these needs to be taken into

384
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
account instead of just focusing on one

385
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,839
data is being provided by the tools

386
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,000
so

387
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
when we come to the intelligence

388
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
collection um it's well most of you you

389
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
know aware of the intelligence

390
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
collection most likely so there are a

391
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
lot of different ways of collecting

392
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
intelligence and that could be awesome

393
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
hamid messi and second and mint

394
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,000
am i int or mint or media i i am int

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
image intelligence so different agencies

396
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
you know pers

397
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
certainly collect this kind of

398
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,399
information but what we really focus on

399
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,760
is the awesome the open source

400
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
intelligence because

401
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,279
we can assume that every single law

402
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
enforcement agency or every single

403
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
investigator who

404
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
definitely don't have access to the rest

405
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
of the you know intelligence services or

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,000
data

407
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,880
so

408
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,199
austin is basically collecting evidence

409
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
from the public domain or open open

410
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
domain open access domain it could be

411
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
just some news websites

412
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
and like blogs and for academics

413
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
academic journals academic conferences

414
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
proceedings and you know the websites of

415
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
academics for their blogs and it could

416
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
be also from the public data some

417
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
government reports and or some other you

418
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
know agencies reports the data can be

419
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,120
collected from them and be used during

420
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,279
the investigations

421
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,760
so how and why it should be really used

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
because

423
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,279
when we think about the crimes crimes

424
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
are not only of course speedy crimes and

425
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,120
they are not only dealt with the you

426
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
know small law enforcement agencies

427
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
um you know when they when the crimes

428
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,279
are getting bigger and bigger and bigger

429
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,720
they are getting actually more you know

430
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
sophisticated and more complicated so

431
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,959
different approaches than just you know

432
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
traditional forensic investigations

433
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,399
actually are needed so forensic

434
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,760
intelligence is

435
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,959
highly

436
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
being suggested to be integrated but

437
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
it's not unfortunately

438
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
at the same level as

439
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
its its importance dictates

440
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
so of course the benefits we can get if

441
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
we incorporate the forensic intelligence

442
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
into digital forensics it could be we

443
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
can disrupt the crimes and prevent them

444
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
hopefully it's red you know usually

445
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
digital forensics is known to be

446
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720
a you know um

447
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
like reactive approach

448
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,399
things happen

449
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
crimes happen then we collect evidence

450
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
and find like who did this and when it's

451
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
happened and why it's happened and how

452
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,639
it's happened like we try to answer

453
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,079
these questions

454
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,880
but

455
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
we can actually you know prevent the

456
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
crimes we can actually you know disrupt

457
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
the crime um you know efforts or

458
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
criminal efforts

459
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,079
and it's going to definitely help for

460
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
the time and cost efficiency is going to

461
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
provide time and cost efficiency one of

462
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,399
the projects that we are working with

463
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
nasik the

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
national air and space

465
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
intelligence center

466
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,639
so they

467
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
they are totally focusing on this we do

468
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
have time

469
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
we have huge data that we don't want to

470
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
spend that time with huge amount of data

471
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,199
so how can we make sure

472
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
that the

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,519
the the data collected from the various

474
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
different intelligence you know sources

475
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
can be understood

476
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
without using traditional digital

477
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
forensics techniques because they are

478
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,759
not limited to the forensic procedures

479
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,560
so it's actually a huge you know on help

480
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,079
for them of course the first part as

481
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,759
well

482
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,920
so early identification of suspect it's

483
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
going to be very useful if

484
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,360
if you collect you know information

485
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
intelligence from one case

486
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,199
it can

487
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,519
be helpful for the other cases

488
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,000
that you know potentially some

489
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
connections or links can be established

490
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,640
between the cases and suspects can be

491
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
identif identified excuse me earlier

492
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,199
and of course more effective use of

493
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,839
forensic traces that inform policing

494
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,919
policy and also security actions that

495
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,359
interpol is actually doing this very

496
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,919
well i can say that they do a lot of

497
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,480
good um you know

498
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,400
connections with various different

499
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
intelligence services and do actually

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
stop and prevent

501
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
significant amount of you know organized

502
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
crimes

503
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
and of course

504
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
general tangible benefits of you know

505
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
related intelligence products such as

506
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
threat and risk assessment and situation

507
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
reports there's also one of the um you

508
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
know

509
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
benefits that we are trying to get on

510
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
another project i'll be talking about we

511
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
are working with fema um dhs and fema on

512
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
this just to train some of the higher

513
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,200
level administrators on on cyber attacks

514
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
and better understanding of criminal

515
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,918
activity as a whole as well

516
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
so i'll be talking about three projects

517
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
today so briefly i'll be talking about

518
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,600
them that we try

519
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
to incorporate forensic intelligence

520
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,280
approaches

521
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
and traditional digital forensics

522
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,280
approaches and also some cyber security

523
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
approaches like bullying white

524
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,640
and red team approaches and actually

525
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
purple team as well so into you know one

526
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
interdisciplinary or multi-disciplinary

527
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,919
project that we can answer

528
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,640
the

529
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
or we can address to the challenges that

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
they are dealing with

531
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
the first project was this project was

532
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
funded by nij

533
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
this project

534
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,799
targets to

535
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,760
help criminal justice institutes

536
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,919
particularly correctional institutions

537
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
so the goal on this project basically

538
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
the first developed ai based system ai

539
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,200
supported system to help the offenders

540
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
to successfully re-entry to the

541
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,240
community in other words

542
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
we try by using ai techniques and some

543
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
of the other

544
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
intelligence techniques to reduce the

545
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,600
recalculation the incarceration rates of

546
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
the offenders when they are released

547
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
under supervision

548
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,919
and

549
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,280
what we are going to do in order to do

550
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
that we are going to deploy a system we

551
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,080
are working with the tippecanoe county

552
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
coming to corrections and we will be

553
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
working on 125 participants and they are

554
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,440
going to be using our technology

555
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
wearables and smartphone so that we can

556
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,799
collect some data and help them

557
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
to achieve their goals because the app's

558
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
name actually we named it goals gaining

559
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
occupational and life skills the our

560
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,120
goal is to help them to accomplish their

561
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,559
goals in life

562
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
without you know going back to their

563
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
previous life and committing crimes

564
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
again

565
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,919
so and what we do we analyze the what we

566
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,960
are going to do at the end we are going

567
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,600
to analyze um the data this is going to

568
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
be you know collected from these devices

569
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
and and see the impact of a sms

570
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,840
so here what we are what i am showing on

571
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
the right panel is one of the forensic

572
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,919
techniques that we use we collect

573
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
geolocation data

574
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
constantly from these individuals to

575
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,880
make sure

576
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,679
this data that represents truly where

577
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
they are where the devices are being

578
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,520
used and compare if this data

579
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
it can be validated by some of the other

580
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
uh promises that they they have given

581
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
because these individuals release under

582
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,919
supervision

583
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,840
they have to be on certain at certain

584
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
locations and they there are many other

585
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,960
different ways of deceiving of course

586
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
the systems but we are trying to make

587
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
sure that these individuals are where

588
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,440
they are supposed to be and constantly

589
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,480
providing this data to do to their um

590
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
you know specialists who are working

591
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
with them to make their life in order

592
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,039
and and successful re-entry to the

593
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,159
community

594
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
and so another approach that we are

595
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
using is using an ai or this is in

596
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
progress still using ai to identify

597
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
the surrounding so where these

598
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
individuals are

599
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
if they are somewhere

600
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,559
by by analyzing the ambient noise if

601
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,799
these individuals are with

602
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
certain group of people if these

603
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,799
individuals are at certain locations

604
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,400
that they are not supposed to be like

605
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,840
bars taverns and you know these you know

606
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,400
kind of locations if they are of course

607
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,440
in their list of uh prohibited locations

608
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
or you know um where they they're not

609
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,480
supposed to be

610
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
and also we also identify where they are

611
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,200
supposed to be so all of these cross

612
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,679
correlations are being made by

613
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,360
collecting the data

614
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
of

615
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
really

616
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,760
using the forensic techniques from a

617
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
watch smart watch and

618
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,039
an

619
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,400
android smart smartphone

620
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,159
so

621
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
other project this was a collaboration

622
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
with lockheed martin

623
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
this project has different aspects but i

624
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
would like to focus on the part that we

625
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,679
use the intelligence

626
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
um and how we use the forensic

627
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
intelligence techniques and and actually

628
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,440
open source intelligence techniques as

629
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
well as some of the um cyber security

630
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
best practices

631
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,520
so in this project the goal was uh first

632
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,679
first of all highlighting the technical

633
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,240
gaps in a in a region where there's a

634
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,159
conflict between two countries and it's

635
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
actually a real conflict

636
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
and happening in a location and there is

637
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,280
a

638
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
um there is a harsh terrain in in the

639
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
region and there are some certain you

640
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,039
know attacks between uh one count you

641
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
know countries receiving attacks like

642
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,720
drone attacks so this project

643
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,559
specifically focused on the you know

644
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,000
identifying the limitations in the

645
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
defense systems

646
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
um particularly long-range and

647
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
short-range

648
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
missile defense systems against the

649
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,039
emerging air threats and particularly

650
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,200
focused on the you know the uavs and

651
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
later on we focus on the missile attacks

652
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
like long-range missile attacks

653
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,159
and the second is to model and simulate

654
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,720
a solution to these limitations

655
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
you know and making sure that the

656
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,960
defense can be made better uh for for

657
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
the defending you know region

658
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,919
and lastly we propose recommendations

659
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,520
for the near and long range um you know

660
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
long-term future modifications and

661
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,760
enhancements for the currently available

662
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
missile defense systems in the in the

663
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,880
country

664
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
so as you see in the in the left image

665
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,120
there are there there's a green line and

666
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
then the the line actually becomes

667
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,679
purple

668
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
so in those lines there is a there's an

669
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,320
emerging threat it's an it's a drone

670
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,799
attack and because there's a very harsh

671
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
terrain it's a mountain very steep

672
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,039
mountain and there's a

673
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,520
drone is actually drones multiple drones

674
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
are attacking to a certain critical

675
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,799
infrastructure

676
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
the the current missile defense systems

677
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
do not engage with this because that

678
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
purple that means they are not being

679
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,159
recognized or they're out of range

680
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,400
so our goal was to identify with by

681
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
using open source intelligence of course

682
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
we were not giving provided any other

683
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
information using the open source you

684
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
know intelligence how we can make this

685
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,880
system better

686
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
and and enhance so that at least one if

687
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,440
possible multiple

688
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
defense systems can detect and

689
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
eventually engage with these incoming

690
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,879
toronto attacks

691
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
and we tested our our

692
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
model and simulation

693
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,039
with a multiple number of drones we

694
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,360
we range i think the range was from 10

695
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,480
to 30

696
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
um you know pack of drones being

697
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,559
attacking to do certain locations so we

698
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,039
want to you basically test the the

699
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
limits of the defense systems and how

700
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,440
many of those incoming threats can be

701
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
eliminated and given

702
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,279
with the given system capabilities

703
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
another

704
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
project that we use

705
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
open source intelligence

706
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,760
particularly is also um it's called crow

707
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
ray it's cyber resilience adaptive

708
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
virtual reality experience this project

709
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
was funded by fema

710
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,679
and this is actually one of one of its

711
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,880
kind

712
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
truly it might be applied to some some

713
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
other domains but this is one of its

714
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,080
kind for fema that fema has never

715
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
provided any training

716
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,039
um to to their stakeholders in vr

717
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,159
environment

718
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
and and this is the ongoing project

719
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
still

720
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
some of them actually almost health is

721
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
done

722
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
we are creating a whole course for

723
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
females so that they can actually host

724
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,559
this on their page and

725
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
particularly for the mid-level and

726
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
higher level executives

727
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,039
and those who are making decisions

728
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,080
during

729
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,039
um cyber security attacks during the

730
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
uh natural disasters

731
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,360
and how they can actually react to these

732
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,320
so incident responders well for the for

733
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,400
the lower level isn't responded they do

734
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,159
have some procedures they do have best

735
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,440
practices

736
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,039
but when it comes to the higher level

737
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
the the incident comment post

738
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,159
it may not be that clear for the for

739
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,760
these individuals to make decisions so

740
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,039
what we our goal is to train the the

741
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
ebola mid-level um you know decision

742
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
makers so that they can actually

743
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
understand the threats understand the

744
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,240
risks and understand the the challenges

745
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
so that they can actually uh react to

746
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
these

747
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,640
problems in these we create real-life vr

748
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
scenarios and we cover certain things we

749
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
focus on we cover the prevention and

750
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
mitigation strategies briefly but our

751
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
focus is really

752
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,799
is on the continuation of the recovery

753
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
and response operations because most of

754
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
the cyber attacks we have seen

755
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:44,960
or

756
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,320
you know available in the open you know

757
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,279
domain are simply happening during the

758
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,760
disaster there's an attack the goal is

759
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
really take benefit

760
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,159
of these disasters so that they can gain

761
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,039
some you know financial or some other

762
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,159
political

763
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
um you know gains from the you know

764
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
attackers and criminals perspectives and

765
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
the second is to disrupt the response

766
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
and recovery operations like if there is

767
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,520
any incident happen and then the for

768
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,200
instance first responders are responding

769
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
to the incident but there is another

770
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
attack let's say attack to do their

771
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,799
smart grid their you know um

772
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
uh traffic lamp systems so that they

773
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
cannot actually or they cause you know

774
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
panic in the city

775
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,799
attackers so that they cannot reach to

776
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,360
the certain locations so other the

777
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
natural disaster cannot be

778
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
recovered and response operation

779
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
operations might be halted

780
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
so this is also another project this

781
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,039
project was also

782
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,760
uh started with this another seed

783
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
project i would like to mention and like

784
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
thank west lafayette and lafayette

785
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
police department uh we we create the

786
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
training scenario with the uh for the

787
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,200
for the police officers that you know if

788
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,520
you remember the first slide i was

789
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
talking about that

790
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
we don't deal with the physical evidence

791
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,640
like you know

792
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,600
csi without blood actually we do as i

793
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
and after corrected actually uh make

794
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
that you know comment

795
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
so the physical evidence actually

796
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
becomes very important and this

797
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,679
one of these

798
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,919
images are showing a real case

799
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,840
that the whole

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,440
case child porn case was sold by finding

801
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,600
the physical evidence

802
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
of course that physical evidence was

803
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,919
supporting digital evidence eventually

804
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,880
and that physical evidence was a box

805
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,399
box of a camera

806
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,840
camcorder um behind the couch

807
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,559
and the only reason was actually that

808
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
everything was sold the puzzle was sold

809
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
because the serial number on the box was

810
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
associated with the

811
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,760
on the video posted online and the

812
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
serial number in the metadata of that

813
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
video they were perfect match and

814
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,279
eventually the you know the suspect

815
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,399
confessed

816
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,640
so the physical evidence plays really

817
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
important role in digital investigations

818
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,039
and vice versa so therefore we always

819
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,760
suggest to you know keep in mind that um

820
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
using open source information and

821
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,640
thinking about thinking out of the box

822
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,039
for digital investigations will always

823
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,919
help

824
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
and help to you know view the issues and

825
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,440
and investigations holistically

826
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
just you know two

827
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,279
citations over there and

828
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,720
this is my lab's um qr code and my email

829
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,760
is there cmit at purdy and

830
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,120
you're welcome

831
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,240
for any questions thank you

832
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,900
[Applause]

833
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,399
thank you

834
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,679
very interesting

835
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
there are two big problems that i see

836
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
i do a lot of work in the court as an

837
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
expert

838
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,200
because intelligence is a huge problem

839
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
for court yes so i do a lot of work as

840
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,120
an expert witness i'm a computer

841
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,840
scientist and i do um

842
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,039
a lot of explaining to the jurors what

843
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,240
to make out of all of what we're seeing

844
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
there are two enormous problems that we

845
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
have

846
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,279
and those are

847
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,840
selection bias in the data

848
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
and confirmation bias in the

849
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,320
investigator

850
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
are there techniques

851
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,919
that you are exploring or

852
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,080
recommendations that you are making

853
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,880
that can address that and before you

854
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
answer one other bit of background i

855
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,159
meant to provide

856
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,480
is in many cases

857
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,080
the data will be made available only

858
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,840
to the government which is to say the

859
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,279
prosecution

860
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,559
the defense is denied the ability

861
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,279
to compel the production

862
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
of evidence that would be in their favor

863
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,399
the lawyers can argue about why the

864
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,360
constitutional problems arise here but

865
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
this is a serious problem that is in

866
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
fact affecting us right now and in my

867
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,600
view is actually undermining the

868
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,399
legitimacy of our field

869
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,039
yeah i mean i it's a huge it's a huge

870
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,880
problem in this domain i know we have

871
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,279
been talking to some other experts as

872
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,440
well they are dealing with this problem

873
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,399
what we do for the selection problem is

874
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,240
um

875
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,159
i actually that's a good question for me

876
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,919
because one of the

877
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,519
projects i didn't mention we are working

878
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,640
on it

879
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
is targeted data extraction that the

880
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,600
selection is actually

881
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
can be done later on as well by

882
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,799
preserving the data and actually

883
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,279
integrity of the data so what we do we

884
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,919
allow the the law enforcement to select

885
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,000
certain type of data actually that was

886
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,399
it three years ago talk then we actually

887
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
extend the system for multiple multiple

888
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
devices

889
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,159
helping the investigators to select

890
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,039
certain data types and then later on if

891
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,519
it is being questioned the report can

892
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,559
provide where the evidence exactly found

893
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
and if they want to you know challenge

894
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,519
this

895
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,279
if they can obtain the data they can

896
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,120
actually work and find exactly where it

897
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,159
was but sometimes i agree

898
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,480
the data is not being provided to the

899
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
other parties i mean i don't know how

900
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
that can be sold of course this is a big

901
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,279
issue what was the second question uh

902
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
confirmation bias in the investigator so

903
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
the way that they play yeah they're so

904
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
it's like to give a concrete give a

905
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,080
concrete example so imagine that you've

906
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,240
got a violent crime

907
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
somebody's charged with committing a

908
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,279
violent crime

909
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
in one case you have the government come

910
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
along with all of the records everything

911
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,559
from a t or whatever and they do all

912
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,080
this estimation this is the tower you're

913
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,200
talking to yippity yappity and also

914
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,799
um they will provide uh you know some

915
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,519
some other sort of stuff like some gps

916
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,240
data that they got from whatever in

917
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,360
another case unrelated the circumstances

918
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,519
may be the same

919
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,320
but

920
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
we don't have any relevant gps data from

921
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
the device so they've got pictures of

922
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,440
whatever and it's just not at the same

923
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,600
date same time doesn't matter

924
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,399
but

925
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,320
they do not have

926
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,840
and will not

927
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,679
secure the records from the phone

928
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,760
company that would show us what towers

929
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,679
they're talking to but then they will

930
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,559
say well this guy was over there and and

931
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,279
and this second case has no way to get

932
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,240
to the data that we know the the the

933
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
provider has

934
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,360
that would be able to establish which

935
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,679
tower his phone's talking to yeah that's

936
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,120
that's a very good question actually i

937
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,799
want to point one of my students in the

938
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,279
room mirza he's actually working similar

939
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,600
to this problem

940
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
exactly we are having the same challenge

941
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
i focus on the mobile forensics

942
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,279
investigations more mobile devices and

943
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
we have this problem sometimes the data

944
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,080
that we get cannot be verified but with

945
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,679
this padding of life

946
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,200
approach that's what we are trying to

947
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,039
develop right now we can get and provide

948
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,000
prove the existence of that data even

949
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
though the data the total justifications

950
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,199
are not being provided by finding some

951
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,239
other relevant data and actually spatial

952
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,320
um you know data analysis is going to

953
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
help us for this especially geolocation

954
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,918
and that's what mirrors us work

955
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,520
specifically working on that that's

956
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,119
going to be hopefully helping us to

957
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
understand what was really going on and

958
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,800
how we can prove the existence of this

959
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,839
data with other you know available data

960
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,960
that's a hope

961
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,480
but we are working on i know this is a

962
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,960
huge challenge

963
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,760
i appreciate that

964
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,040
yes

965
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
thank you

966
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,399
any other questions

967
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,040
very interesting work i like your

968
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,359
approach uh applying machine learning

969
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,359
into the forensic field now one of the

970
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,119
questions i have is

971
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,240
you know

972
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,079
when you're investigating the digital

973
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
forensic evidence

974
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
the privacy is certainly going to get in

975
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,040
the way so

976
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,400
just from the

977
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,880
digital forensic community are there any

978
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,119
discussion to say maybe we should also

979
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,599
thinking about a privacy preserving

980
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,160
evidence or what might be this you know

981
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
the direction to go for for folks in

982
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,079
your field it's a very good question

983
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,680
it's a huge concern in the digital

984
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
forensics field but there are cases

985
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
right

986
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,160
there are certain cases privacy is not

987
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,320
the real concern i mean if it's a you

988
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,640
know it's not about the privacy it's

989
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,839
really

990
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
if the data that you are getting is

991
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,160
relevant to your investigation or not

992
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
and there is a case actually here is

993
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,440
riley v california um after that case i

994
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,880
think 2016 2015 or 16 case

995
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,280
after that case specifically supreme

996
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
court ruled that the investigators

997
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
cannot

998
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
um

999
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,920
look at the data that are not directly

1000
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,440
relevant to their investigations for

1001
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
instance so they know the the incident

1002
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,040
happened like

1003
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,800
you know last night you know between

1004
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,160
certain time frame 9 pm to 12 p.m right

1005
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
and and then they know that it's a let's

1006
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,240
say hit and run case

1007
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,400
and the witness actually brought their

1008
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
phone and i took the image or

1009
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,920
or

1010
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,960
a video of a car hit and run and here's

1011
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,720
my evidence but they are afraid of their

1012
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
privacy

1013
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,599
right they don't want to reveal their

1014
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,280
phone to the police because maybe

1015
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
there's something else yeah i mean

1016
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,520
that's this huge problem and rightly

1017
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
california actually

1018
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,560
prevents any illegal searches and and

1019
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,800
and you know looking at unrelated data

1020
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,040
on the devices but for the criminal

1021
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
cases it might be right if the

1022
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
california case still applied to that

1023
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,119
problem

1024
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,119
that the data is not

1025
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
relevant to the investigation

1026
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
must be excluded from the from the

1027
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
investigations and of course

1028
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
you know subsequent um cases coming out

1029
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,200
from those

1030
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
unlawful search

1031
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,280
of the of the data okay but machine

1032
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
learning wise yes uh we are being

1033
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
criticized on this the bias and the

1034
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,040
privacy all these concerns but at the

1035
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
end of the day the law

1036
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
doesn't necessarily

1037
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
favorable on machine learning that we

1038
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,240
can't directly use the results of

1039
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
machine learning it has to be you know

1040
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,640
eventually at the end of the day the

1041
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
expert must testify for this right

1042
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,960
expert must understand the results from

1043
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,880
machine learning and confirm the

1044
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,400
findings

1045
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,880
very good thank you

1046
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,920
is uh fascinating work that you're doing

1047
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
here one question is a former prosecutor

1048
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,640
the decision on what to disclose or what

1049
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
matches the relevance and the targeted

1050
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
aspect of the investigation who is

1051
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
sifting through the data lake to make

1052
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,119
that determination

1053
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,440
um

1054
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,760
who's going to make the determination

1055
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,920
it's as to whether or not the request is

1056
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,079
related to the specific data in other

1057
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,079
words who's the adjudicator to make oh

1058
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,160
yeah so the targeted data extraction

1059
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,520
tool that we are developing is

1060
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,400
particularly for witnesses and victims

1061
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,720
it's not for the cases of um you know

1062
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
for the suspects or you know criminals

1063
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
so for that case we give a consent form

1064
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,520
the consent form actually appears on the

1065
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,400
device

1066
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
at the first time when the

1067
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,079
the victim or witness sits down with an

1068
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,640
investigator and they actually choose

1069
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
the the filters and limitations of their

1070
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,960
you know surgeons user and then they

1071
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
give consent to the investigator and

1072
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
then the tool extracts the data

1073
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,440
accordingly based on the content

1074
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,359
received and the content is actually

1075
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,599
very well defined and also signed by the

1076
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,079
owner of the device

1077
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,839
interesting i'll have to think about it

1078
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,920
and yes and we i'll be happy to talk

1079
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,240
about this because uh we have also

1080
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,119
training on this uh for the for the law

1081
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,880
enforcement officers prosecutors and

1082
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
judges as well how to use these

1083
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
technologies

1084
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,079
so have you thought about

1085
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,440
lashing that up to different

1086
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
jurisdictions who might be looking at

1087
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,440
the same person but they don't know it

1088
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,000
we haven't uh focused on that because

1089
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,599
probably that could be actually a great

1090
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
you know extension of the project the

1091
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,839
specific you know the requirement for

1092
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,079
this project was really to focus on the

1093
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
witness or victims in a you know

1094
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
specific jurisdiction which is usually

1095
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,760
the local jurisdictions sure thank you

1096
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,480
very much thank you

1097
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,480
all right one follow-up since we've got

1098
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
the the former prosecutor question

1099
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,079
actually is have you seen any case where

1100
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,119
he dealt with

1101
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
where there's some something like a like

1102
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
a special master

1103
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,960
or or or the

1104
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,400
think the where did he go the aries so

1105
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
there there was a case i was working on

1106
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,359
where we had the sort of the concept

1107
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,320
like a taint team so we had an unrelated

1108
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
attorney and also a computer scientist

1109
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
sit down and go and go through this and

1110
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,240
the idea was is was you know basically

1111
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,560
so instead of having the machine just go

1112
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,079
through and filter things out is that

1113
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,640
you would basically have an attorney and

1114
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,040
a computer scientist that would train

1115
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,480
the the that would that would be

1116
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
involved in that so that was sort of the

1117
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,359
legal oversight have you dealt with any

1118
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,640
of those no i never never dealt with

1119
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,960
that problem but i well for i know in

1120
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,920
europe case uh because of the gdpr after

1121
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,560
following the gdpr it was

1122
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
prohibited to make direct decisions

1123
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,560
after the mission learning i don't think

1124
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
we have it here in the us

1125
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
uh it is still i believe as far as i

1126
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
know my knowledge it is actually

1127
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,640
recommended to sit down with an expert

1128
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,480
and understand the details

1129
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
but for the for the europe it's not that

1130
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,800
case they totally you know dismiss the

1131
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
the results from the machine learning it

1132
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,359
only can be taken as an advice so that

1133
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,960
they can actually go ahead and find

1134
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,520
actual evidence and testify for it

1135
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,160
actual evidence

1136
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,319
a true evidence

1137
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,640
in this case

1138
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
thank you very much

1139
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,920
um thank you very much

1140
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,319
so i'll use this as an example of saying

1141
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,200
we oftentimes get to hear well academia

1142
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
is only dealing in pie in the sky type

1143
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
he is and none of is applicable to

1144
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,520
actually the real world i hope this one

1145
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,920
talk has already dispelled that that

1146
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,160
you know part of the university's uh

1147
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
land grant mission is to move the world

1148
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,319
forward and and i think this is research

1149
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,200
that obviously shows that it it uh

1150
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,599
it's not pie in the sky it's not theory

1151
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,680
it's actual work that can can be put to

1152
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,680
practice
