1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,960
so

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,040
let me say welcome to everyone who's

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,400
tuned in

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
for the final

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
seminar of the series for the spring

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,840
semester

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
and

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,080
we have saved one of the best for last

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
uh professor murray myra o'neill

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
and i didn't quite get that but i hope

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,119
it's close

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,080
uh

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,599
it is uh a lovely gaelic name that uh i

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,680
i've tripped over there

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,199
but uh professor o'neill is the regius

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,479

she's also the director of the center

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,520
for secure information technologies

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
she has a whole lot of recognitions and

she uh has been in this field for a

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
while is is known for

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
work in electronics and cryptography in

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
particular but she's going to talk to us

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
today about securing connected devices

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
challenges and opportunities

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
and before she starts let me remind

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080

introduction

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
so let me go ahead and share my screen

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
here

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
so i hope you can all see that

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,560
um okay so um

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
i really appreciate the invitation to

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
come and speak to you all um today as

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,759
part of your seminar series and uh i i

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
will begin my talk um just by firstly

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
introducing uh my research institute

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
and the center for secure information

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
technologies at queen's university

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
belfast and just a little bit about what

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
we we do at the institute

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,880
and so

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
csic was established in in 2009

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,799
and as the uk's national innovation and

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,399
knowledge center for cyber security

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,119
research and we've enjoyed over 30

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
million pounds in external investment

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
over the first two phases of the first

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
almost or over 10 years

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,239
in our existence and we're currently

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,040
entering a third phase of investment

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,160
so we've had

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
numerous awards um within the uk and

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
recognition for the work that we've done

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
within our our center

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
and since then including in 2015 a

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
queen's anniversary prize for the work

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,959
that we've done in sort of strengthening

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,680
global cyber security and our work and

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,400
our research um our original founder

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
professor sir john mccannie was awarded

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
united in 2016 and the institute was

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
also awarded a regis professorship um

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
um back in 2015 2015-16 as well and i

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
currently hold that professorship

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
and we also recognized by our national

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
cyber security center the ncsc as an

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
academic center of excellence in cyber

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
security research and indeed more widely

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
were also recognized by them

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
in terms of our cybersecurity education

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
portfolio as well

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
so the mission of our center is to

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
couple major research breakthroughs in

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,840
the field of secure information

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,040
technologies with a unique model of

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
innovation commercialization to drive

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,879
economic and societal impact so what do

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
i mean by this sort of unique model of

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,159
innovation

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
and well somewhat unique certainly for a

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
uk university and is that we have a team

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,519
of

93
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
engineering staff

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
and industrial experience engineering

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
staff and commercial staff who sit

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
alongside our academic research team

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,080
and they their their role is to support

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,519
the work of the academics to help with

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
research translation and this allows us

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,200
to to undertake rapid response projects

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
in collaboration with industry as well

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
as longer term research projects and

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,599
with our industry partners

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
and and the team then helped to develop

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,080
proof of concept demonstrators based on

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
our research output as the first steps

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
towards commercialization

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
so in terms of within our institute

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
the our focus is looking at the

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
underpinning

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,238
technologies that are needed to um

112
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,358
secure

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,400
and complex systems uh looking at

114
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
security of devices to securing the

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
communications between devices right up

116
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
to securing the information and

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
get garnered from devices and stored in

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
the cloud so we look at a range of

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
activities from things like trusted

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
hardware looking at malware detection

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
resilience and industrial control

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
systems and and and then looking at all

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
the way up to kind of things looking at

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
ai for cyber security security for ai

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,199
and

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,639
autonomous security as well

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
so we also have an industry membership

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
program so we have a small number of

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
fulfill member companies who pay to be

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,199
part of um our program and sit on our

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
advisory board and also influence and

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
help to inform our research and

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
development roadmap and then we have

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,520
associate members who we also

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
collaborate with them sort of uh i

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
suppose

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
and less significant or more sort of

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,360
more on a smaller contract and project

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
basis and these obviously change uh

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
quite more regularly i guess than our

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
full member companies

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
and then to say as well that the

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
institute also has an in a lot of uh

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
activity in the innovation space and we

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
do a lot of work in supporting startups

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,759
scale-ups and smes working in the area

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,160
of cyber security in partnership with a

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
number of other organizations so we run

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
a cyber runway program in conjunction

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
with cylon and deloitte

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
supporting a range of activity in this

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
space

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
and then a really good example of some

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
of the work that we do in this area has

155
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,440
been

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
the work we did as a delivery partner on

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
a 13.5 million pound uk government

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
funded acceleration program

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
called lorca standing for the london

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,319
office for rapid cyber security

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,960
advancement and this was alongside

162
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
plexil

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
and deloitte and based in the here east

164
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,759
site

165
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,160
at the original olympic park site in

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,039
london

167
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,000
um and our role within this work was to

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
provide academic master classes to

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
cohorts of companies coming through and

170
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
also to provide engineering support um

171
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
through our engineering team

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,199
so over the past three years at 72 cyber

173
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
scale-ups uh joined the lorca program

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
and they have raised over 200 million

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
pounds actually an investment and

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,919
created over 800 jobs and since uh since

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,800
that time so it's been really successful

178
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
today and we're currently in in the

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
stage two of this we're calling it lorca

180
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,479
ignite where we're taking a number of

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
those projects even further along in

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
their journey

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
and then

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
finally in terms of our institute and

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
we've been a critical factor in

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
establishing northern ireland as the

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
uk's leading cyber security cluster so

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
from a standing start back in 2009 when

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,280
cesar was formed uh we've grown the the

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
cyber sector in northern ireland uh to

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
now employing over 2 300 people across

192
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,000
104 companies generating 110 million in

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
salaries each year so the range of

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
companies is from again you know

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
supporting and those sort of startups

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,599
and scale ups but also we've we've

197
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,160
helped to attract much larger companies

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
the likes of pwc and delight deloitte

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
who now actually have their major cyber

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
security uk cyber security teams based

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
in in their northern ireland offices

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
so i've been hugely successful and and

203
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,800
is continuing to grow

204
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
so um coming back then to the title of

205
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
my talk today which is looking at

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
securing connected devices and

207
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
challenges and opportunities

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
so in back in 2018 now and tech republic

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
uh released a list of the 11 or so least

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
secure connected devices and not

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
surprisingly um it would include

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,039
devices like smart locks interactive

213
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,639
toys connected cars and wireless medical

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,199
devices your overlooked office devices

215
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,159
so connected coffee machines and so on

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,120
and

217
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
and things like smart smart baby

218
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
monitors and obviously if an attacker

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,880
comprises compromises any of these

220
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,000
devices

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
they can gain internal access to your

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
network and and all your information

223
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,839
will be at risk so what we're seeing

224
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
obviously in the last five to ten years

225
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,720
is a significant increase in the number

226
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
of attacks against these types of iot

227
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,440
devices and it continues to increase at

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
year on year

229
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,480
so

230
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
um so for example particularly are we

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
seeing now malware designed to

232
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
specifically attack these types of

233
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,959
devices so back in in 2016 i'm sure many

234
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
of you are aware of we had the mirai

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
botnet and which targeted in the end

236
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
over a hundred thousand iot devices and

237
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
were compromised

238
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
for use in a massive and distributed

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
denial of service attack against din and

240
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
which disrupted uh us internet traffic

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
and

242
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
quite a number of the significant and

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
major services such as amazon and

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,720
netflix twitter and bbc and so on um and

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,360
then we've seen variants of this uh more

246
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,080
recently so then we in 2018 we had the

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
hide and seek botnet

248
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
and again it

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
was able to spread very rapidly and

250
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
across iot devices using custom built

251
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,600
and peer-to-peer communication to try

252
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
and exploit those devices

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
and and i suppose a little bit we've

254
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
seen again variants of those but more

255
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
recently in the last few years we're

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
actually seeing new malware being

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
developed again targeting these types of

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
devices and now coded in go so that the

259
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
language development google and and and

260
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
this is actually sort of a new malware

261
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
built from scratch and again relying

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
solely on brute forcing its way into iot

263
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
devices

264
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
so in in recent research

265
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
that's actually looking at the scale of

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,160
these types of attacks and iot devices

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
this is really you know really a global

268
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
global scale and in particular uh china

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
and brazil are host to the highest

270
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
number or currently or

271
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,440
as of april 2020 uh hosts to the highest

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
number of compromised iot devices

273
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
so then um oh wasp um

274
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
released a list of what it believes to

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,079
be the top uh uh 10 vulnerabilities that

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
make iot devices insecure

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
and you know i'm not sure if you can

278
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,320
kind of read this in some detail and but

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
um

280
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
this includes things like um week

281
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
um

282
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,600
week passwords or hard-coded passwords

283
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
insecure network devices and insecure

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
sort of interfaces to devices and like

285
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
some apis and so on

286
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
lack of appropriate security update

287
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,480
mechanisms and for some of these devices

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
and the use of outdated components

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,079
within the devices or insecure

290
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,440
components

291
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,680
insufficient privacy protection is

292
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
another major issue on any information

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
stored on devices and then secure them

294
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
data transfer and between devices

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
and we're also listed here is the lack

296
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
of device management or appropriate

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
device management and for devices and a

298
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
very obvious one is then around in

299
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
secure default settings where many of

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
the attacks and in terms of malware

301
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
types of attacks are targeting because

302
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
of the kind of default settings that are

303
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
shipped with devices and then the final

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
one and number 10 looks at lacking the

305
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
lack of physical hardening and physical

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,120
security of the devices and themselves

307
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,519
so certainly over the last or over in

308
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
recent years and particularly the last

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,040
five years we're seeing a lot more

310
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,600
guidance standards policies processes

311
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
now being put in place that are starting

312
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
to deal with some of some many of these

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
issues and particularly around things

314
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,399
like insecure password guidance and

315
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
dealing with insecure default settings

316
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
and and requiring now that all

317
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
manufacturers ensure that that more

318
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,519
secure default settings are put in place

319
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,880
for devices

320
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
but the focus of our research

321
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
has that has been on the new

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
technologies

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
that are helping to address iot security

324
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
and and looking at issues in particular

325
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,160
around things like the physical

326
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
hardening looking at access control and

327
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,839
vulnerable access control

328
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,760
vulnerabilities and the privacy

329
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
protection of information stored on

330
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,639
devices

331
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
and then another major factor that i

332
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
suppose can't be overlooked is then the

333
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,079
recent vulnerabilities that are actually

334
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,760
affecting i suppose the underlying

335
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
hardware itself

336
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
and

337
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
significantly the work that's been done

338
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
on microarchitectural attacks so

339
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
back in 2018 we had the introduction of

340
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,639
meltdown and spectra and with meltdown

341
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
exploiting the out of order execution to

342
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
leak target targets physical memory and

343
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
spectre looking um at taking advantage

344
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
of of the speculative execution using

345
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,079
brandt's production and mainly all of

346
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,160
these attacks again targeting

347
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
microprocessors really meant that

348
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,399
billions of devices that were affected

349
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
and significantly because they attacked

350
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,160
not just sort of one particular micro

351
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
architecture microprocessor but intel

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,120
amd arm microprocessors were all

353
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,279
vulnerable to these types of attacks

354
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,199
and then more recently

355
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,000
um we're coming to then like the last

356
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
example i have here is crosstalk where

357
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,120
again this is looking at the the the

358
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
possibility and of attackers being able

359
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,480
to

360
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
to leak sensitive information now from

361
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
across course or on many intel cpus and

362
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,959
this is then been able to bypass some of

363
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,480
the character measures and mitigations

364
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,160
that have been put in place against some

365
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
of the the meltdown inspector types of

366
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
attacks where it was assumed that it was

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
kind of morally targeting sort of

368
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
different course and therefore you know

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
this can now there's this crosstalk uh

370
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,399
attack can now thwart those those

371
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,079
mitigations so again a serious challenge

372
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
in terms of trying to understand how to

373
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,839
build better protection for iot devices

374
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
and then finally in terms of some of the

375
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
major issues what about if you think

376
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,399
about the an internet of cloned things

377
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,639
so obviously with the the globalization

378
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
of supply chains we now have the use of

379
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
overseas boundaries third-party ip uh

380
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
third-party test facilities and with so

381
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,920
many different

382
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
untrusted entities now involved in the

383
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
design and assembly phases it's becoming

384
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,480
increasingly difficult to ensure the

385
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
integrity and the authentication

386
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
authentication of electronic devices so

387
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
supply chains are now susceptible to to

388
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
a range of hardware-based security

389
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
threats from things like hardware

390
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
trojans ip piracy reverse engineering

391
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
cloning and things like side channel

392
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
attacks and again a recent uh a recent

393
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
report and published by europol and the

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,240
eu

395
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,399
intellectual property office

396
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,519
i mean you

397
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,120
have

398
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
are saying now that counterfeiting

399
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
counterfeiters are actually now

400
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
exploiting the current uh global supply

401
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
shortage and semiconductor chips and

402
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
starting to to use this these issues to

403
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
help bring more account of the goods and

404
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,199
cloned uh devices into the supply chain

405
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,199
and obviously with counterfeit devices

406
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,360
they they can much more easily then host

407
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,839
malicious software firmware or hardware

408
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,240
and i suppose more worryingly due to the

409
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
nature of the anti-count or the

410
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
counterfeiting industry it's actually

411
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
very difficult to ascertain the true

412
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
extent of the problem

413
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,920
so then if we're trying to then looking

414
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,720
at the challenges with iot devices what

415
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
are the challenges when we try to look

416
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
at well how can we provide security

417
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
in connected devices and what challenges

418
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
do we face

419
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,839
so first of all um

420
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,360
obviously connected devices and iot

421
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
devices tend to be lightweight at low

422
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,240
power quite cheap devices and

423
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,839
cryptographic algorithms that are

424
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
typically used to secure provide

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
security and can often involve

426
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,079
computationally expensive operations and

427
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,839
in particular if we think of wanting to

428
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,639
provide authentication and we would need

429
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
to use public key cryptography which is

430
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
is quite computationally intensive and

431
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
and therefore expensive to implement so

432
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,759
how can how can we go about implementing

433
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,160
these complex cryptographic processes

434
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
and actually today with um now with the

435
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
post quantum cryptographic process that

436
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
are even more and computationally

437
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,759
intensive

438
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,160
is it possible to achieve what you need

439
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
on very resource

440
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,079
devices to help protect and data and

441
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,679
help protect the authentication of

442
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
devices

443
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
and then a further issue then is is the

444
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
fact that adversaries typically then

445
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,240
have physical access to connected

446
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
devices and these types of devices to

447
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
perform attacks so things like side

448
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
channel attacks become much more easy

449
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,599
and for attackers and can be used to

450
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,319
extract sacred keys from the devices

451
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,640
using a range of

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,799
techniques from power consumption

453
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,960
electromagnetic emanation timing

454
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
analysis and even acoustics to uncover

455
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
the secret key used on devices so to

456
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
give a very simplistic i guess

457
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
simplistic example of this

458
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
um

459
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,440
one of today's um most secure

460
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
cryptographic algorithms and from a

461
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
mathematical point of view is obviously

462
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
the rsa algorithm

463
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
and and um

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,320
uh just again just to to show that how

465
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,039
easy it can be and one of the the main

466
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
uh functions within this is squaring

467
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,799
multiply algorithm within rsa and it's

468
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,120
directly um includes the the secret key

469
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,080
value within this algorithm so it uses

470
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,880
it uses that in in this loop down here

471
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,559
so if your your key value and is a zero

472
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,720
then you perform a squaring and if it's

473
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,960
a one you perform a squaring followed by

474
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,919
a multiplication so then actually it's

475
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,559
it's possible to then identify that by

476
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
simply monitoring the power consumption

477
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,679
so if we if we implement the basic rsa

478
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
algorithm on a device and monitor the

479
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
power consumption the power profile of

480
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,880
these different operations or these

481
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
operations the square and multiplier

482
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
actually different and therefore it's

483
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
very easy to see

484
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
when your key bit is either a zero and

485
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,919
where you'll have a square on its own

486
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,679
and then a one wheel of a square

487
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
followed by a multiply and simply then

488
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
by looking at that par consumption

489
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
profile you can read the key the secret

490
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
key directly from that information

491
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
that's leaked

492
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,039
so

493
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,100
then if um

494
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,440
[Music]

495
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
so then yeah so we need to obviously in

496
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
terms of today's devices um

497
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
it's rsa uh is not um

498
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
used in its in its native form

499
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,720
sorry i've got a visitor off the go i'm

500
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,240
gonna talk go go go go close the door

501
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,640
um and um so in today's um devices rsa

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
isn't implemented in sort of native

503
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
foreign obviously for this reason and it

504
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
has some protections but there are still

505
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,679
some a lot of challenges in terms of

506
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,080
mitigating against side channel attacks

507
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,679
which i'll talk about a little bit later

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,280
on in my talk

509
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
so if then a further challenge then as

510
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,559
i've already mentioned um the idea of

511
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
post-quantum cryptography being complex

512
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
to implement we kind of think about what

513
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
if quantum computers um become our

514
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
reality and in um

515
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,620
in

516
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,280
[Music]

517
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
in the future and you know okay it's

518
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
maybe if and when but uh quantum has

519
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
become a reality well actually

520
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
um commonly used um public key

521
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,520
encryption algorithms um will be uh

522
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,080
vulnerable to shores quantum algorithm

523
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,679
so for example um rsa and

524
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,120
um

525
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
electric curve cryptography uh based

526
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
techniques are based on integer

527
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
factorization and the discrete law of

528
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
problems so shor's algorithm can solve

529
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,679
both problems at exponential speed up

530
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,679
over today's classical computers so

531
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,600
therefore this means that with quantum

532
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
computers it will be possible to break

533
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
all of today's um security systems which

534
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
uh uh

535
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
you know the majority of which use

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
public key processes and and if you

537
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
think about iot devices they typically

538
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,559
have a secure boot mechanism baked into

539
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,799
the silicon that cannot be upgraded so

540
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
that will leave many of those devices

541
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,880
vulnerable to quantum attacks in the

542
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,360
future so i guess you know when i talk

543
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
about this often it's asking what is the

544
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
likelihood of such an attack or what you

545
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
know when will quantum computers become

546
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,080
a reality

547
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
so

548
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,880
um

549
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,360
michelle mosca who is an expert in

550
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
quantum cartography and where he works

551
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
at the institute for quantum computing

552
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
at the university of waterloo and in the

553
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
last few years um he has uh looked at

554
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,280
releasing a report um on the quantum

555
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
threat timeline and the most latest

556
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,679
report and

557
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,799
shows really looks at what the experts

558
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
in this area their estimates of the

559
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,520
likelihood of a quantum computer uh

560
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,440
being able to break rsa 20 2048 in 24

561
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,320
hours

562
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,159
and this is quite quite interesting and

563
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,000
that the most recent report

564
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
really suggests that it is most experts

565
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
think that this is fairly likely to

566
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
happen within the next 10 to 15 years so

567
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
it's really i guess not that far away

568
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
and obviously in the us at the moment

569
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,039
the national institute for standards and

570
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,440
technologies or nist um is just

571
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
finalizing um their a standardization

572
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
process looking to select um new post

573
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
quantum or quantum resilient algorithms

574
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
that are resilient to uh attacks quantum

575
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
attacks such as shore's algorithm and

576
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
those will be standardized standardized

577
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,960
in the next uh two years or so and and

578
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,840
and uh open them for adoption for

579
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
companies

580
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
so in terms of then looking at well um

581
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,559
you know in terms of all these

582
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,360
challenges and so on then what in terms

583
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
of our research that he sees it what

584
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
we're trying to do is looking at

585
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
addressing the security of future

586
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
connected devices and what can we do to

587
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,880
better address this problem and things

588
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
like the physical hardening of of

589
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,440
devices and privacy protection and so on

590
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
in terms of research

591
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,520
so first area we look at um is an area

592
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
called physical and clonable functions

593
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,600
and and for those who may not be maybe

594
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,360
aware of what this is a physical and

595
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
clonable function or puff

596
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,640
is a a digital circuit that uses

597
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
manufacturing process variations to

598
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,559
generate a unique digital fingerprint

599
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
so when a and a puff circuit is

600
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
implemented

601
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,240
and on a device for any given challenge

602
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
and a unique response is generated and

603
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
so even then if the same puff circuit um

604
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
is implemented on a second device

605
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
identical to the first device and and

606
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
for a given challenge and again another

607
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,080
unique response is generate so therefore

608
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
no two chips given the same will give

609
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
the same response when supplied with the

610
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
same challenge so you're effectively um

611
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
creating that unique digital fingerprint

612
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,880
from electronic devices that's picking

613
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
up on those unique under underlying

614
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
manufacturing process variations so it's

615
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
really really quite clever technology

616
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,080
and and then the applications then are

617
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,080
things like in terms of anti-can provide

618
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,440
anti-anti-counterfeiting anti-tampering

619
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
and things like unique key generation

620
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
for devices and then lightweight

621
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
authentication and unique identification

622
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
uh procedures for um for lightweight

623
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
devices

624
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,559
so

625
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,159
um so some of the work that we've been

626
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
doing has been looking at over over many

627
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360
years have been looking at various uh

628
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
physical and clonable function designs

629
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,840
and and how can we use this technology

630
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,559
again in applications um to to sort of

631
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
try and solve some of the challenges so

632
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
we've been looking at both memory and

633
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
delay based props and the first one here

634
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,760
that i'm showing is some work that we

635
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,640
did on memory based puffs or sorry delay

636
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,600
based pops and for really a delay-based

637
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
puff is really looking at creating a

638
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,000
race condition between the delay paths

639
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
of variability as sensitive circuits and

640
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
and then to maximize that variation and

641
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
and and to avoid any sort of bit

642
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,559
aliasing that can occur

643
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
the wiring paths um must be placed and

644
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
rooted um as symmetrically as possible

645
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
to minimize any nominal delay difference

646
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
that can kind of appear between two

647
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
paths so if

648
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,679
as we do for working with fpgas that can

649
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,000
be accomplished by manual writing and

650
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
timing analysis of your design so for

651
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,559
example in our a very very lightweight

652
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,200
design which we call uh picopuff and to

653
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
generate a one bit response um

654
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
authentication authenticated response

655
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
from a device we use two flip flops and

656
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
two cross couple of nand gates and then

657
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,480
the timing of the two delay lines um in

658
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
in in the sort of the higher delay line

659
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
and the lower delay line and the circuit

660
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,559
here and

661
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
i then will differ and so if they're

662
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
manually placed in a route to be

663
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
identical in terms of length but they

664
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
will actually differ in terms of the

665
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
timing due to the underlying

666
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
manufacturing variability and that's

667
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
what you're trying to pick up and detect

668
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,039
in terms of producing your response

669
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,840
and so to generate then a 128-bit

670
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,480
response it will cost you um so we've

671
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
looked at implementing one of these

672
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
circuits so for a one bit response on a

673
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
slice within an fpga device for example

674
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,279
in this case we're showing a spartan 6

675
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
device and so to generate 128 bit

676
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,200
response

677
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
it will cost you 128 slices so it's

678
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,039
quite minimal in terms of the the

679
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,919
hardware area and the hardware resources

680
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,640
and even less for example on on other

681
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
devices so

682
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
and we've also done work where you've

683
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
actually shown how you can you know this

684
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
example is just this circuit implemented

685
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,080
within one clb um but we can actually

686
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,919
fit more than one of these circuits

687
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,720
within a clb as well so again it's just

688
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
very minimal footprint in terms of

689
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,679
design

690
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,200
so again ideal for um for for sort of

691
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,760
lightweight and those connected devices

692
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
so in terms of how this performs well um

693
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,559
we one of the you know one of the

694
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,080
advantages of this is due to that

695
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,880
balance routing approach achieves very

696
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,520
high uniqueness across in terms of you

697
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,960
know what you're looking for is that

698
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,600
this will be achieve a unique response

699
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
on on every device that you implement on

700
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
so we have a large test vessel test bed

701
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
of devices

702
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
that we use in our research and you're

703
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
looking for and you know we look to

704
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
measure in terms of uniqueness and

705
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
trying to understand that that metric

706
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
you look at the internship sort of

707
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,440
hamming distance and you're looking for

708
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
a metric of 50

709
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
so we can achieve very high uniqueness

710
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
value from this particular design and

711
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,840
then in terms of reliability obviously

712
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,159
because you're you're picking up on an

713
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,080
underlying manufacturing process

714
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,679
variation and you really need to ensure

715
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
that um that it's it's resilient and

716
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,760
reliable against uh environmental

717
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
variations things like temperature

718
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,080
changes and any sort of voltage changes

719
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
and so on and obviously you need it to

720
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,240
be a hundred percent reliable so again

721
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,799
in terms of this um particular design we

722
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,799
achieve very high reliability results

723
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,279
with it as well

724
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,360
and this picture just shows again one of

725
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
the proof of concept demonstrators that

726
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,679
our engineering team helped to build uh

727
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,640
based on this research work

728
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,760
so then the other um sort of main uh

729
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
sort of area within puff designs is a

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,919
memory based box and this is kind of

731
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,840
typically looks at

732
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
basing uh looking at your response from

733
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
the measurement of startup values for

734
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
example in memory sales so that's a

735
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,159
typical it's called an sram for example

736
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,919
and we've been looking at prof based on

737
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,880
d ram memory and and dram cells are

738
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
gated capacitors so the manufacturing

739
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
process variation is really in the rates

740
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
of charge and discharge and that's then

741
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
our entropy source that we're trying to

742
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,960
detect here so we generated a heart we

743
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
generate a harder rooted id so

744
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,600
controlled read errors and this this is

745
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,080
a very intrinsic uh puff so there's no

746
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,960
additional hardware and we use only sort

747
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
of commodity and hardware devices with

748
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
no modifications to test test designs so

749
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
we can generate a very very quickly

750
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
generate large reliable identifiers and

751
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,279
from drampuff and our challenge in this

752
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,279
case it will be a set of timings plus

753
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
the memory locations to read and then

754
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,880
the response is that error pattern

755
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
so in this case we did a proof of

756
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,480
concept demonstrators this was a

757
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
particular project we were involved with

758
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,120
so we did a proof of concept

759
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,240
demonstration on linux desktop systems

760
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,760
and achieved

761
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
speed up improvements in terms of the

762
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,039
design and protocol approach that we

763
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,000
used for this um over previous work and

764
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,799
kind of the area we achieved near again

765
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,039
near ideal uniqueness with the responses

766
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,600
that were developed and in terms of of

767
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,159
you know how it's it's unique uh digital

768
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
fingerprint on different devices and

769
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,200
again in terms of the the metrics we did

770
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
in terms of measuring temperature

771
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,440
variations and so on and again very very

772
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,559
highly reliable uh design

773
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
and result

774
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
so um some of the work then we've done

775
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
is to say in terms of of different puff

776
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,320
designs including those that i've just

777
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,240
talked about as i say we've developed

778
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
proof of concept demonstrated these and

779
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,919
then in collaboration and co-creation

780
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,240
with a number of industry partners and

781
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,799
we've looked at um translating this

782
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,559
technology into a range of application

783
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,279
scenarios so for example uh we did some

784
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,600
work with lg cns and ethereum south

785
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,399
korea on translating this into and

786
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,600
evaluating

787
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,480
uh

788
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,520
work around uh for anti sort of anti uh

789
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,799
tampering of ev charging systems uh so

790
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,559
tamper proofing some of the components

791
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,120
within their charging systems uh we also

792
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
looked out for enhanced authentication

793
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
of smart meters and another project and

794
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,120
and then also um with a company partner

795
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,200
looking at simply just looking at using

796
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,919
this technology an electronic component

797
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,640
anti-country cutting and we're still

798
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,159
very much actively researching

799
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,440
collaborating with with industry

800
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
partners in this area um

801
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
and still yeah still ongoing research uh

802
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
to be added

803
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
so then um in terms of then other other

804
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,640
work that we can do and what we are

805
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,039
doing to to to address some of the

806
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,120
security challenges is in the area of

807
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,840
side channel analysis so as i mentioned

808
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,679
earlier side channel analysis can be

809
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,559
used to extract secret keys from devices

810
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,159
using things like electro

811
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,159
electromagnetic ammunitions and timing

812
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,720
analysis and so on or power consumption

813
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,559
and so what we're doing in our research

814
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
is investigating both new attack

815
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,799
techniques as well as low cost country

816
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,120
measures to protect um sort of embedded

817
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,519
devices against attack and obviously in

818
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,480
terms of really understanding uh how you

819
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,840
can develop character measures you need

820
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
to understand the capabilities of attack

821
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
approaches and many um sca based or side

822
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
channel attack sorry based approaches to

823
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,760
date and collect the based on

824
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
differential power analysis and

825
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
correlation power analysis and these

826
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,039
have been well known but more recently

827
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
we're starting to see a machine learning

828
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,080
how it can um learn from the side

829
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,679
channel information to actually reveal

830
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
the secret key of a cryptographic device

831
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
and one of the challenges of machine

832
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
learning is that actually it can bypass

833
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,679
some of the medications that are already

834
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,440
in place and in devices to to protect

835
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,679
against some of the the more traditional

836
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,360
side channel attacks like differential

837
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,679
power analysis and the the correlation

838
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,600
part analysis attacks

839
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,559
so

840
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,720
we did some early work again using that

841
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,880
uh novels and neural network based

842
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,519
profiling attack against a mast um sort

843
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,399
of smart card implementation of aes and

844
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,880
again and proposed the use of a

845
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
pre-processing step and just to using

846
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,080
pca to just significantly increase the

847
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,320
success success of that attack and we

848
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,039
developed a classifier that not only it

849
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
not only correctly then identifies a

850
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,720
mask that's used to kind of help

851
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
mitigate against previous

852
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
um types of attacks so it bypasses that

853
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
countermeasure and then once that's

854
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
removed either you can then you know

855
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,440
perform your traditional attack or again

856
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
simply use the machine learning approach

857
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,320
to continue on to to uncover the secret

858
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,279
key

859
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,559
and then

860
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,799
uh more recently i would be looking at

861
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,559
suppose that more and sort of deep

862
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
learning based attacks so we proposed a

863
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
convolutional neural network based

864
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
approach um and this actually uses sort

865
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,279
of plain text and as an additional

866
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,760
feature to the input of this attack and

867
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,279
again i'll not go into the detail on

868
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,039
this there's more to give the high level

869
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,360
but very happy to to and to speak to

870
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
anyone who's interested in the topic and

871
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,360
but using that plain text that

872
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,679
additional feature and we can reveal the

873
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,840
secret key and again from sort of

874
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,279
protected um devices and that have

875
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,200
mitigations in place against traditional

876
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,760
side channel attacks using that machine

877
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,679
learning capability we're able to reveal

878
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,240
the secret key with just two traces just

879
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
two and power traces and from the device

880
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,600
so these can be very very of i suppose

881
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,480
easy attacks and again and it shows

882
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,559
really the capability of machine

883
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,399
learning approaches so with this

884
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,080
technology we're currently still at the

885
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
attack stage but also more recent

886
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,159
research has again been looking at well

887
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,440
actually how can we use some of the

888
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,159
capability here to then look at

889
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,839
mitigating against these types of

890
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,199
machine learning attacks and we're

891
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,719
looking at a number of approaches at the

892
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,959
moment and in that in that area

893
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,359
so um another topic um that we we

894
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,639
address is harder trojan detection and

895
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
again using some and machine learning

896
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,399
and deep learning based approaches

897
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,480
actually to help with this so you know

898
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,199
harder trojans and obviously malicious

899
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,000
modifications to to ics integrated

900
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
circuits and again as i mentioned with

901
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,239
that globalization of the semiconductor

902
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,639
supply chain um it's becoming more

903
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,719
difficult to ensure the integrity and

904
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,440
authenticated authenticity of devices

905
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
and one of the approaches we're looking

906
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
at is well how what can we do more and

907
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,918
targeting that design phase and to

908
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,320
ensure that at that phase in terms of

909
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
having different um third-party ips and

910
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,920
so on that we can trust um the designs

911
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,280
and so taking advantage then of machine

912
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,160
learning based methods and we have been

913
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
looking at those approaches in terms of

914
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,000
helping um to

915
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,520
to then

916
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
to design harder trojan detection

917
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,200
approaches and more recent research

918
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,000
so

919
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,839
um

920
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
so in terms of yes some of the work

921
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
again that we've done in this area is

922
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,040
looking at um really

923
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,320
um a really a sort of a range of

924
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,000
approaches so first of all looking at

925
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
things like uh pre-processing of the the

926
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,599
the net list so you know really the use

927
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,280
of machine learning is quite new in this

928
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,680
area and so it's like well how can you

929
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,480
translate this into in this problem into

930
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
something that we can address with and

931
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
with these

932
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
new techniques and so we've looked at a

933
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
novel sort of net list information

934
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,760
extraction strategy and then using

935
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,920
nlp or natural language processing

936
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,760
techniques that can help in terms of

937
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
information in coding and then that

938
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,960
those encoded feature traces can then be

939
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,760
um input into your more typical sort of

940
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,839
deep learning based uh classification

941
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,440
models and so using things like lstm and

942
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
and the convolution neural network

943
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
models and and then using that those

944
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,000
approaches in terms of providing that

945
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,720
harder trojan detection and our training

946
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
and testing for this are based on

947
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,599
obviously as i said and this is a a

948
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,440
suppose and you know

949
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,760
you won't get companies to provide you

950
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,520
with information on hardware trojans

951
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
that readily and so we're using open

952
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,240
source uh hardware trojan benchmarks so

953
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,839
using the trust hub and libraries and

954
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,839
and benchmark circuits for the research

955
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,040
that we do and again using these these

956
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,640
this approach we're actually able to

957
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,839
achieve um very very promising detection

958
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,119
results and harder children detection

959
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,839
results for um both combinational and

960
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,200
sequential uh circuit or harder trojan

961
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,240
circuits

962
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
so

963
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,599
um to the best of our knowledge some of

964
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,599
this work is probably the the first

965
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,320
detection system that really entirely is

966
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
based entirely on on deep learning

967
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,520
approaches

968
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,160
and and it's a sort of a data-driven

969
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,119
detection approach so um it can detect

970
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,520
harder trojans without having without

971
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,400
the the author having to have any prior

972
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,359
knowledge of really the the circuits so

973
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,280
really the the idea

974
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,680
for this is you know that we can embed

975
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
some of this um technology and some of

976
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,320
these

977
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
into tools and

978
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,119
eda tools so the designers and don't

979
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,440
need to know they have the expertise in

980
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
in all of these areas but can run these

981
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,079
tools to very quickly check and if the

982
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,520
designs that they're they're

983
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
incorporating into system on chips and

984
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,598
have hardware trojans or or not

985
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,320
so um another area then as we're looking

986
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,920
at is um as i talked about the um the

987
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,240
issue with them post quantum and

988
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,359
cryptography um and and this will be the

989
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,880
the last day of research that i talk

990
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,280
about and this is obviously mitigating

991
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,839
against um the the potential for quantum

992
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,400
attacks and and and the attacks from

993
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
things like shores already and so

994
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,919
um

995
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,160
yeah move on here and so

996
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
firstly just to speak to again we've

997
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,839
been looking at this area for quite a

998
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,280
number of years and we we hosted a major

999
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,839
uh european horizon 2020 project on this

1000
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,760
topic and back in started in 2015 and

1001
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,839
and finished in december 2018 and this

1002
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,440
was actually around time that and it was

1003
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,240
2015-16 that nest actually started its

1004
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
standardization or launched the

1005
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
standardization process for new

1006
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,160
post-quantum techniques and but this

1007
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,240
particular project again was really to

1008
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,440
look at um you know because these these

1009
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
new approaches to

1010
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,839
creating quantum resilient cryptographic

1011
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,960
approaches

1012
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,800
are much more complex than today's

1013
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,640
classical rsa and elliptic curve

1014
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,720
approaches and actually are they

1015
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
practical or sufficiently practical for

1016
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,760
us to be able to use them and in in

1017
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
practice in future ict systems and

1018
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,440
applications

1019
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,320
so

1020
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
there are a number of different um

1021
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,800
approaches that can be um that can be

1022
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,880
targeted in this particular project we

1023
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,960
targeted lattice-based cryptography and

1024
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,359
we worked for with a number of consortia

1025
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,200
partners and industry partners you

1026
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,400
should see in on the bottom of the

1027
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
screen here and with our industry

1028
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,920
partners ibm talus and an sme in the uk

1029
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,640
called hw communications and we looked

1030
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
at developing practical solutions for a

1031
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
number of areas one of which was

1032
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,560
targeting sort of iot devices

1033
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
so as i said um

1034
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,640
really the idea behind postgraduate

1035
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,880
cryptography is that it aims to build

1036
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
crystal systems from classical problems

1037
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,520
these are are not quantum based

1038
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,920
approaches as um you know the classical

1039
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
problems that are used and well for

1040
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,079
which there is no known way to recast we

1041
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,480
cast that problem in a quantum framework

1042
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,160
and as i say there are a range of

1043
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
approaches that can be adopted so code

1044
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
based hash based multi-rate code radic

1045
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,200
and signature six games and and also um

1046
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,599
as i say labs basic cryptography and

1047
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,920
last base cryptography really looking at

1048
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,839
based on shortest vector or closest

1049
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,160
vector problems finding the shortest

1050
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,079
vector in a high dimensional random

1051
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,319
lattice it is a well-known challenging

1052
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,200
task and that's believed to be hard even

1053
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,000
for quantum computers so from that sort

1054
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,319
of underlying wired problem we can then

1055
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,560
build cryptographic approaches that we

1056
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,800
can use for encryption authentication

1057
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,200
and indeed advanced techniques as well

1058
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
so as i said the the nest competition

1059
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,400
launched in 2016 and as i say draft

1060
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,119
standards are due you know we're due to

1061
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,800
hear uh the the announcement anytime um

1062
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,280
and uh and drafts down to be developed

1063
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,359
in the next two years and our this

1064
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,280
particular consortium that we led we're

1065
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,520
involved in three of the submissions and

1066
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
all that is based approaches and of all

1067
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,640
made it through all of the different

1068
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,400
rounds the process are on i've made it

1069
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,960
through to the final stages and so very

1070
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,040
very very um

1071
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,640
was hopeful and expect that certainly

1072
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,079
lattice-based cryptography is a really

1073
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,040
key contender here and as a as a as a

1074
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
post-quantum standard going forward and

1075
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,960
indeed one of these um one of these

1076
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,119
schemes that will be chosen

1077
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,200
so kind of in terms of summarizing some

1078
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
of the outcomes of the work that we did

1079
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,359
we developed some practical hardware and

1080
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,520
software implementations of some of

1081
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,839
these lattice-based approaches and in

1082
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,440
terms of both authentication and

1083
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,520
encryption and some of the say advanced

1084
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
cryptographic primitives things like

1085
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
identity-based encryption and

1086
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,839
authenticated key exchange and and we

1087
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,400
also looked at building in resistance to

1088
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,480
these designs to side-channel attacks

1089
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
and one of the target areas was on

1090
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
resource-constrained

1091
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,880
devices

1092
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,599
and and looking at um

1093
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,200
not only just in terms of the

1094
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,359
performance but also as i say what can

1095
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,359
we also build in resistance to side

1096
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,359
channel attacks and still

1097
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,440
deliver this on resource-constrained

1098
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,440
devices

1099
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,960
and so um as i say with one of the the

1100
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,640
partner companies in this case it was

1101
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,920
the sme

1102
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,440
um in

1103
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,000
in the uk and we looked at

1104
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,560
being able to use uh a lattice-based

1105
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,040
approach for smart tag systems where we

1106
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,119
were implementing some of the approach

1107
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,119
in terms of of obviously trying to keep

1108
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,280
some of the more computational aspects

1109
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,000
of of the approach to the reader side of

1110
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,920
the system but also being able to

1111
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,480
implement some of the com the complexity

1112
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,560
within the tags themselves and obviously

1113
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,480
with the limitations that imposed we

1114
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,119
would successfully and show a scheme and

1115
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,560
that delivered

1116
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,880
that for those kind of devices so you

1117
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,839
know really it is achievable um for for

1118
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,520
iot devices

1119
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,800
and then more recently we've been

1120
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,160
looking then at really um demonstrating

1121
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,400
hybrid quantum safe solutions so this is

1122
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
in collaboration with with the toshiba

1123
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,280
and we're combining some of the quantum

1124
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,880
key distributions of quantum

1125
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,560
cryptography with some of the

1126
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,880
post-quantum cryptographic algorithms so

1127
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,319
obviously in terms of being able to

1128
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,640
provide the authentication piece we need

1129
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,920
to be able to use some of these

1130
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,319
post-quantum classical approaches and

1131
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,480
we've been able to to implement

1132
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,560
um the the one of the lattice-based

1133
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,640
schemes so the kyber scheme as part of

1134
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,839
the nest competition into an overall

1135
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,079
hybrid uh quantum key distribution

1136
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,599
system and again successfully

1137
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,359
demonstrating that again this is

1138
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
probably somewhat a way off from from

1139
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
being able to target

1140
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
resource-constrained devices but again

1141
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,079
they're they there's again very um

1142
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,000
significant leaps in terms of the whole

1143
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,319
quantum technology space and a lot of

1144
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,560
research targeting uh quantum

1145
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,280
cryptography and targeting sort of more

1146
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,760
lightweight and more efficient devices

1147
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,520
as well

1148
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
and another project we look at again is

1149
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,560
in the uk we have a major sort of

1150
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,200
quantum hub and quantum hubs

1151
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
in the quantum space so we're part of

1152
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,680
the quant uk communications hub and

1153
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,920
again looking at developing very

1154
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,240
efficient uh post quantum digital

1155
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,480
signature designs and the exploration of

1156
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,119
this idea of exploring these hybrid and

1157
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
very efficient hybrid post-quantum qkt

1158
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,079
designs and in this project we then also

1159
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
look at that security piece so what are

1160
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,160
side channel attacks how do we build

1161
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,319
resilience into that into these and

1162
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,319
these sorts of hybrid systems as well

1163
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,160
okay so um so to conclude my talk um i

1164
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,480
guess for the the true potential

1165
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,359
um

1166
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,480
of connected devices to be realized and

1167
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,960
you know in terms of of you know the the

1168
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,119
fact that in terms of being able to

1169
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,319
enable the ubiquitous nature of iot and

1170
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,760
you know we we have many many billions

1171
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,680
of these devices um

1172
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,480
now in the world and if we want to get

1173
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,960
the true potential of those and

1174
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,040
gain gain from the advantage that they

1175
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,240
can offer to society and we really need

1176
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,400
to ensure that security is built into

1177
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,319
those devices from the outset of their

1178
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,480
design and that it's not as an

1179
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
afterthought

1180
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,160
now as i said earlier in terms of the

1181
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,599
you know the the 10 vulnerabilities um

1182
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
of within iot devices standards and

1183
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,839
policies and guidelines um are emerging

1184
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,599
to mitigate against a certain

1185
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,760
vulnerability so things like default

1186
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,440
settings weak passwords updates etc but

1187
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,359
technologies can also help and that's

1188
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,040
where our work and our research have

1189
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
come in in terms of helping with things

1190
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,119
around the physical hardening with data

1191
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,920
protection and and the data privacy and

1192
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,319
providing authentication of the devices

1193
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,440
but also and securing that that sensor

1194
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,520
did on those devices so i've talked

1195
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,880
about some of the technologies that

1196
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,480
we're looking at in terms of physical

1197
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,520
and clonable functions and for

1198
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,920
anti-counterfeiting for unique unique id

1199
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
and generation unique authentic and also

1200
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,560
authentication or very lightweight

1201
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,240
authentication and for some of these

1202
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,720
devices i talked about and the need to

1203
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
develop things like machine learning

1204
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,720
based uh countermeasure or site channel

1205
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,200
attack counter measures and and some of

1206
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,400
the work we're doing in terms of the

1207
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,319
attack approach first of all in that

1208
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,800
space um and then looking at machine

1209
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,640
learning based harder trojan detection

1210
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,119
so to start looking at terms of of the

1211
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,440
the eda tools what can we do at that

1212
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,119
stage to try and

1213
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,359
detect things like clone devices at a

1214
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,800
much earlier stage and then finally i

1215
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,720
talked about our work on lightweight

1216
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
quantum resilient cryptographic

1217
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,480
solutions and as we move towards um

1218
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,200
the the the with the nest standards uh

1219
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,680
coming uh through in the next two years

1220
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
and as we move towards the potential for

1221
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,160
quantum computers becoming a reality of

1222
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,480
what that means for cryptography and we

1223
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
will certainly see that that

1224
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,200
again iot devices will certainly be

1225
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,160
vulnerable and we need to ensure we have

1226
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,839
appropriate lightweight quantum

1227
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
resilience solutions that are available

1228
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,640
to support that

1229
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,079
so finally the uh the security of i

1230
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,040
guess the security of connected devices

1231
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,800
and can be regarded as as just one layer

1232
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,520
and all they connected infrastructure

1233
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,319
and her however certainly secure

1234
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,040
connected devices are critical to all of

1235
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,400
this and and a stat change in the

1236
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,720
security and privacy of all layers of

1237
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,960
connected systems as needed and to

1238
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
ensure the usability acceptance of it

1239
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
all but as i say those secure connected

1240
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,520
devices are absolutely critical as they

1241
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,400
can they can provide the root of trust

1242
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,680
for your entire system

1243
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,119
so just to finish and this slide really

1244
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,520
just shows a number of our recent more

1245
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,839
recent related publications for some of

1246
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,599
the work that i've talked about and

1247
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,960
certainly visiting our website will

1248
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,839
provide um a wider or more extensive

1249
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,760
list of publications if anyone is

1250
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,200
interested

1251
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
so that completes my talk and i'm very

1252
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,960
happy to take any questions

1253
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,319
well we have one in the q a so

1254
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,319
can you see that

1255
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,079
yeah let me read it here so to what

1256
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,400
extent can post content cryptography be

1257
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,119
a drop-in replacement and for public key

1258
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,559
and what are the main difficulties

1259
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,240
differences from a two-user point of

1260
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,040
view

1261
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,640
okay yeah so

1262
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,599
um

1263
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,280
so certainly in terms of the work that

1264
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
we did we've done to date in terms of

1265
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,119
post quantum cryptography it uh it

1266
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,119
absolutely can so yes it is it is

1267
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
somewhat more complex and the likes of

1268
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,440
rsa and elliptic photography but

1269
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
actually in terms of that particular

1270
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,240
um the post quantum or the lattice-based

1271
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,920
cryptographic approaches some of the

1272
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,680
algorithms are actually proving to be

1273
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,480
very very efficient uh to implement on

1274
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,240
devices and certainly on some

1275
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,079
resource-constrained devices so

1276
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,359
certainly this is one factor in the nist

1277
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,480
competition

1278
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,400
uh one of the factors as well as

1279
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,960
obviously the security of any new

1280
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,480
algorithm being developed one of the

1281
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,720
other aspects for for the selection of

1282
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,599
the candidates is that how practical

1283
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,599
they are across a wide range of

1284
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,000
platforms so they are looking at how

1285
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,079
excuse me how efficient they are in

1286
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,400
terms of implementation so

1287
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,160
so um certainly there have been a number

1288
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,000
of examples of where

1289
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,880
um you know these have are now starting

1290
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,760
to be evaluated and used uh within

1291
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,839
within protocols within today's schemes

1292
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,880
and applications and as replacements to

1293
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,280
public key so you you will see much more

1294
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,839
of this uh certainly uh once the

1295
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,599
standards are in place in the next two

1296
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,960
years i guess there is a little bit of

1297
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,760
reluctancy for some companies and to to

1298
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,440
start to sort of

1299
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,680
adopting some of the approaches just yet

1300
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,440
but there's certainly already been some

1301
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,680
examples for it where it has been so it

1302
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,119
certainly is

1303
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,880
it certainly is a uh

1304
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
at the moment there are certainly

1305
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,000
solutions that can provide that sort of

1306
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,319
replacement for public key in terms of

1307
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,640
the challenges i guess

1308
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,400
uh the main challenge

1309
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,119
uh will be the main challenge with the

1310
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,880
limitations and i guess

1311
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,119
two user point of view is really in

1312
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,480
relation to

1313
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,319
um the the key sizes so this is the most

1314
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,119
significant uh differential i guess from

1315
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,920
from your classical approaches and again

1316
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,920
within within our the work that we've

1317
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,440
done in the project we need to work with

1318
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,839
companies because for them that key

1319
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,720
management aspect um

1320
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,040
is a lot more complex with the

1321
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,200
post-quantum approaches than what it had

1322
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,440
been previously for classical due to the

1323
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,160
significant sizes of your keys and that

1324
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,400
are used in those so i i would guess

1325
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,400
that is without a doubt the main main

1326
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,160
challenge and in terms of other

1327
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,240
difficulties there you know in terms of

1328
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,920
you know site billing and side channel

1329
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,000
resilience i don't see any significant

1330
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,359
difference over what you would have to

1331
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,760
do for classical approaches and over the

1332
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,880
post quantum approaches

1333
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,839
all

1334
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,920
right so we've got that one

1335
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,359
the next one's just a comment

1336
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,920
um

1337
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,640
a compliment actually is

1338
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,920
i will take that thank you very much

1339
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,359
it was a great talk you really sort of

1340
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,640
covered the landscape there

1341
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,760
so an interesting

1342
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,319
issue here perhaps we have some

1343
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,640
undergraduates who take this class or or

1344
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,319
uh tune in

1345
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,480
um

1346
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,760
are you are you interested in

1347
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,960
prospective grad students there

1348
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,559
um absolutely very much open to um

1349
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,559
um to to welcoming any uh any stat any

1350
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,200
students who are interested in joining

1351
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,079
and we would have um

1352
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,200
we would have

1353
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,119
some open positions and we're currently

1354
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,280
waiting actually on a a

1355
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,359
on the outcome of a grant that we expect

1356
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,760
very very soon uh which will open up

1357
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,960
actually a large number of of um student

1358
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,920
ships and for graduate students and so

1359
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,559
certainly if anyone is interested and

1360
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,040
please do um certainly get in touch with

1361
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,839
me or keep an eye on our website and

1362
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,280
those opportunities hopefully will

1363
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,000
appear very very soon

1364
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
so i'll tell the audience that uh we

1365
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,200
have a research relationship

1366
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,520
serious with csit and

1367
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,359
i expect that we'll have some ongoing

1368
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,200
collaborations and opportunities for

1369
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,800
anybody who's interested in pursuing

1370
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,640
that

1371
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,480
i wanted to ask uh you don't have

1372
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,640
another question in the q a but this

1373
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,800
closing picture as a

1374
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,960
shipyard with a dry dock is

1375
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
is the university located there or is

1376
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,599
this just uh yeah so

1377
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,760
yeah good good question so um so

1378
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,880
actually um where we're based um season

1379
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,119
is actually based not based on the main

1380
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,680
university campus we're based on our

1381
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,599
kind of uh our science park within

1382
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,520
belfast um and this actually um this

1383
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,359
part here is actually

1384
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,920
the dry dock from which the titanic ship

1385
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,040
sailed

1386
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,319
and so this is the titanic quarter um of

1387
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,640
belfast and this building here in the

1388
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,720
green if you can see um the the laser

1389
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,480
pointer in that is actually where cease

1390
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,960
it is based so we face onto the to the

1391
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,440
dry dock and from where the titanic was

1392
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,480
was uh was was set sail and what's just

1393
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,000
off the picture outside of the picture

1394
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,040
here is um that there's a pump house the

1395
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,920
original pump house uh that was used to

1396
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,040
to um to to i suppose

1397
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,359
help that or you know pump water in and

1398
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,599
out of that dock um during the time when

1399
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,240
the titanic was built

1400
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,040
um well i i hope that uh

1401
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,119
companies don't view it as

1402
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,520
somehow prophetic

1403
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,319
that you are launching startups next to

1404
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,759
uh the titanic's dry dock

1405
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,119
what we normally uh what we normally

1406
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,680
promote is is the great feat of

1407
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,559
engineering which is the building of uh

1408
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,640
the the titanic walls in belfast but

1409
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,920
also many other ships so these two um

1410
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,040
uh cranes here are also um very

1411
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,440
synonymous with the the belfast skyline

1412
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,359
and so much so that they have their own

1413
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,240
nicknames uh samson and goliath

1414
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,599
um and uh and still today there's um

1415
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,040
there's a lot of work that goes on in

1416
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,680
that shipyard and in terms of

1417
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,520
respirator

1418
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,760
uh of ships and other activity so um so

1419
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,000
we we would say that we have gone from

1420
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,520
ships to chips

1421
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,680
within our institute in terms of the

1422
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,399
work that we do

1423
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,559
yeah i see white star house so is that

1424
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,480
the white star line is that still in

1425
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,799
existence as such and so so that's

1426
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,200
that's coming that's named after that

1427
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,960
but that's actually again major

1428
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,720
companies so one of the reasons that we

1429
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,960
set up down on the science part was to

1430
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,520
more closely link with industry partners

1431
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,960
and and there's also one of the

1432
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,599
buildings here is is set up as a it's an

1433
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,000
innovation center so it's set up to to

1434
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,040
house

1435
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,599
uh startups and spin outs so we also

1436
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,040
have space within our building to

1437
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,960
support that activity as well so we

1438
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,040
would work very very closely with a

1439
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,559
number of the companies that are based

1440
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,319
within the buildings around this and

1441
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,400
even this is now already this picture is

1442
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,680
already out of date because there's

1443
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,599
quite a number of new other new

1444
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,839
buildings so this whole area is being

1445
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,680
redeveloped so when we moved to this

1446
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,119
building first our building was

1447
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,680
literally the first building on this on

1448
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,680
this sort of brownfield site and it's

1449
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,000
already had had significant development

1450
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
over over the last few years even so

1451
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
it's quite an exciting time to be in the

1452
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,040
area

1453
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,000
yes

1454
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,880
well

1455
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,359
yeah you can also argue uh uh or tell

1456
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,720
people that uh

1457
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
white star also produced the britannic

1458
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,760
and the olympic

1459
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,839
and and they did exactly

1460
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,839
they meant unfortunate ends but not the

1461
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,880
same way so yeah

1462
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,480
no that's wonderful and i do hope to

1463
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,280
visit there in person sometime and

1464
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
some of our colleagues here at purdue

1465
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,480
to

1466
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,000
take advantage of this ongoing

1467
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,760
relationship

1468
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,400
that's been made available um

1469
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,359
in the time here well i was making those

1470
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,599
somewhat ingest comments but

1471
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,480
um

1472
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,559
i i haven't seen any other questions

1473
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,400
appear in the q a

1474
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,720
so it was a very thorough presentation i

1475
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,000
think you

1476
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,280
you know you you

1477
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,559
covered a lot of the points i couldn't

1478
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,920
think of a good question that i wanted

1479
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,359
to ask

1480
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
so um

1481
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,040
i think this is a good point at which

1482
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,240
we'll

1483
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,119
bid you a good evening uh you're i

1484
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,520
believe five hours ahead of us so we

1485
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,599
very much appreciate you staying up and

1486
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,160
and making this presentation to us

1487
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,280
and to uh everyone who's listening in uh

1488
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,440
following the seminar series

1489
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,480
we will resume in the summer probably

1490
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
and i don't have the date exactly you'll

1491
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
have to look on the website

1492
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,240
but we're going to have uh probably an

1493
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,760
every other week

1494
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,079
set of presentations in the summer of

1495
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,760
somewhat slower pace than during the

1496
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,040
academic year

1497
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,200
and then in august when

1498
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,440
the academic semester starts up again

1499
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,680
we'll resume our once a week

1500
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,280
seminar series

1501
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,040
so these are all available

1502
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,880
online through our website through

1503
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,960
itunes through youtube

1504
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,119
