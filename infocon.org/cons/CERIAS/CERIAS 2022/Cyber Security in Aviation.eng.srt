joining Boeing thank you Jim we

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,260
appreciate you being here everyone

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,220
thanks so much

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,319
you guys hear me

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,060
you guys can

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,580
all right so

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,260
um that was a lot of stuff a lot of

59
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,940
acronyms and probably yeah they're all

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,400
memorized now and fully understand

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,180
um

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,520
when I did so as you might have guessed

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,400
I was ROTC Grant so all this industrial

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,780
Roundtable stuff that you guys are

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,220
participating in I didn't have to do any

66
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,420
of that I walked by and laughed at

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,040
everybody because I knew what my job was

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,599
going to be

69
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,819
um my Air Force assignment took me to

70
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,980
Los Angeles and I developed weapon

71
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,680
systems way back then you also have to

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,319
know there were no computers

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,140
not not that we could use I couldn't

74
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,560
afford one a PC back then was probably

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
about five thousand dollars

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,780
and in 1980s money

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,160
so

78
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,140
um things have changed there was no even

79
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,080
thought of discussion of cyber

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
getting software on airplanes was a you

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,239
know took the 90s 1990s to get uh

82
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,099
regulatory agreement to put software on

83
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,599
airplanes and understand how we're going

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,580
to do that and some of those committees

85
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,080
I was a member on the industry

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,840
committees I was a member

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,819
um the so at Boeing as she was sharing

88
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,040
I've spent the 30 plus years commercial

89
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,560
airplanes I worked on almost every model

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,019
we have in one shape form or another

91
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,480
mostly systems engineering

92
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,819
all right and then I ended up managing

93
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,319
the Cyber team

94
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,540
uh some years ago and then from that

95
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,459
um

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,200
spent a lot of time with The Regulators

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,280
in the FAA and it's still an evolving

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
uh environment regarding well one

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,299
because this threat keeps changing so

100
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,739
what we could do four years ago we

101
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,900
cannot do now and so anyway I wanna I

102
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,400
wanna talk about it and I'm glad Joel

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,920
invited me there's a lot of the Cyber

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,220
work that I see that most cyber

105
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,680
communities are doing is I.T based

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,720
and in aviation we don't have that

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,339
luxury so I'll go through the pitch

108
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,620
we'll talk about that do ask me

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,079
questions you know so I like this to be

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,820
interactive make sure I'm giving you

111
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,400
what uh you need you're gonna probably

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
ask me about design techniques

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,259
you'll get obscure answers I'm not going

114
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,600
to answer that I will reassure you

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,540
though we're not allowed to take

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,940
advantage of our proprietary nature of a

117
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,300
design being secret

118
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,560
ourselves and the regulator don't accept

119
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,259
that as a cyber protection technique

120
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,120
because we realize the bad guys

121
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,180
eventually May jump on our server May

122
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,860
figure out actually get it on an

123
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,360
airplane and start looking at it and

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,880
figure out what we have or don't have so

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,380
we're not allowed to use that but I'm

126
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,600
still not going to give you specifics on

127
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,860
that unless you want to come work for

128
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,720
Boeing which is a good thing then we can

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,000
we'll talk about that all day

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
um I know I know you guys said your

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,440
arrow I was expecting a lot of uh double

132
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,740
E's and cyber folks in this room and

133
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,880
I've got some overviews of Boeing so I

134
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,500
know I know you guys might go to sleep

135
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,940
I'll throw a rock at you or something

136
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,919
you wake you up but so here's some facts

137
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,419
about Boeing

138
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,240
online yeah so

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,780
um

140
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,479
so the Boeing Company you know again I

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,680
know the arrow Community is really

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,919
versed in what we do so we're pretty big

143
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,320
a lot of Revenue sources we're in a lot

144
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,940
of countries we're in a lot of States

145
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,880
you know we're we're in most of the 50

146
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,680
United States we have some Boeing

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,039
presence doing something manufacturing

148
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,660
analysis whatever

149
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,720
um many many many suppliers as you can

150
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,960
see you know so the supplier chain just

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
like our competitors they're very

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
they're gonna it's gonna be very very

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,600
similar and then you know over 140 this

154
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
is last year's date over 140 000

155
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,460
employees and many uh countries

156
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,039
so these are our primary focus areas so

157
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,600
commercial which I'm going to talk about

158
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,020
today I can answer questions on some of

159
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,960
the other aspects of Boeing

160
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,460
and the techniques we use for Aviation

161
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,500
will apply to military but in general

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,840
the military Community is just not

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,400
connected

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,259
so they you know that's one of their

165
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,600
protection mechanisms unlike oh and I'll

166
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
explain what connected means I got a

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,039
really good chart on that

168
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,060
defense and space

169
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,060
Global Services now in addition our

170
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,460
Global Services Group we're we're

171
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,620
working with the grading capability so

172
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,479
some of the supplier-based products that

173
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,400
are provided to us our global Service of

174
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
developing some of that capability

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,419
so some of the hardware that supports

176
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,280
the functionality that my team develops

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,560
is provided by the Global Services

178
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,100
community

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,380
um so we'll go area and just give you an

180
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,960
overview commercial airplanes uh we're

181
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,240
located Puget Sound this time of year

182
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
it's very lovely

183
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,479
you know show up in December it's a

184
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,160
different story

185
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,280
um we we

186
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,580
are the dominant provider I know you can

187
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,560
read data and says Airbus today is

188
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,300
delivering more than we are that's a

189
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,099
really healthy competition one year they

190
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,319
do next year they don't

191
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,800
our goal is more years they don't

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,680
um and so we're working hard for that

193
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,060
they they have the majority of the

194
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,520
narrow body Market unfortunately and we

195
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,380
have by far the majority of the wide

196
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,240
body Market but if you look at ratios of

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,160
numbers of airplanes delivered

198
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
the airlines are purchasing a lot more

199
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,759
narrow bodies than they are white bodies

200
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,160
coven basically for a while shut down

201
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,139
almost all our all our wide body

202
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,060
deliveries I mean is the international

203
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,340
their use for the international travel

204
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,440
and that was affected heavily but

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,300
they're now getting better and we're

206
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,580
getting you know uh deliveries are going

207
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,740
up and the customers are now asking for

208
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,639
the white bodies

209
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,560
so our defensive space is in Arlington

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,539
um

211
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:15,720
the the neat thing here is that bottom

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,699
picture of the tanker

213
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,039
so that is a really neat idea so it's

214
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,919
based off of 767 and then it's been

215
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,139
redesigned to meet military requirements

216
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,199
our customers are not only us but we

217
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,759
have international customers for that

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,979
tank and we had a version of the tanker

219
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,899
we built for Japan and Italy prior to

220
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,640
this it's still in service

221
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:38,760
um

222
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,679
we'll get a chance for you to ask me

223
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,179
what some of these products are if you

224
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,478
don't know

225
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,380
[Music]

226
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,640
oh sorry I was just going to ask what

227
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,140
the top photo was but you just said that

228
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,880
we could say um unmanned Navy product

229
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,500
that uh provides fuel

230
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,480
and so it's been in Navy trials it's

231
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,640
been some new news media about it where

232
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,320
it's on board ship and they're flying it

233
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,060
off of that so it's a relatively new

234
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,180
product we have it's a tanker but it's

235
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,380
unmanned

236
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,220
pretty name

237
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,680
so Global Services a pretty new division

238
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
based out of Texas Plano is very close

239
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,880
to Dallas so if you're familiar with

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,920
that

241
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,420
a lot of our data analytics comes from

242
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,760
that so what one of the goals we'd like

243
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,600
to have if I'm an airline and

244
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,260
um

245
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,360
and I'm operating worldwide I don't want

246
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,100
to have to stock components for my

247
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,660
airplane worldwide

248
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,880
you know sometimes they disappear no one

249
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,820
knows why but it's expensive to do that

250
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,300
so with data analytics and Nia GE would

251
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,560
stand up here and say hey we have the

252
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,380
same thing well no it's about it's our

253
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,300
airplane we have the capability and the

254
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,220
goal we want to get to is

255
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,959
provide to an airline predictive

256
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,519
maintenance capability so that when

257
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,899
they're sitting at their home base and

258
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,980
they're going to go fly that airplane

259
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,019
and they want to and they want to go fly

260
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,399
for 15 days

261
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,839
you know different places around the

262
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,820
world with data analytics they would be

263
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,140
able to do predictive maintenance and

264
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,660
know what they should replace now so

265
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,820
that when it's out and about there's not

266
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,440
a failure of a component that they don't

267
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,540
have stocked at that other location

268
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,459
and therefore they take a delay and have

269
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,899
because they'd have to fly the part in

270
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,420
or spend the money and and keep the

271
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,880
components in that location and as you

272
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
guys know especially the arrow guys I

273
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
mean the airplanes are full I mean

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,740
thousands there's thousands of

275
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
electronic components that are on that

276
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,899
airplane that and and mechanical that

277
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,320
can fail so the analytics is is a big

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,080
area with Services we're providing and

279
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,940
it and I and I believe we're in the

280
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,339
infancy it's only going to get better

281
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,860
so and and my system's part of that

282
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
which I'll talk about a little bit

283
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,740
um so

284
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,140
the the difference in aviation so let me

285
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,019
show you this first chart

286
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,459
when you look at this chart this is an

287
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,680
absolute mess but this is the real world

288
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,959
so if you if you see you see a couple

289
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,760
little airplanes flying

290
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,459
and you see all the infrastructure that

291
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,320
supports those airplanes

292
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,959
so everything from

293
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,540
um I I certify a software update on some

294
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,420
component on that airplane and I do that

295
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,820
let's say I do it with a supplier

296
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,000
and and the FAA certifies that part that

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
supplier has to provide that part to the

298
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,660
airline and so that's what this

299
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,420
ground-based activity is and it and we

300
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,700
needed that part to be secure

301
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,320
so we don't want it to arrive at the

302
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,440
airline or anywhere in this chain and

303
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,620
have been altered you know in a bad way

304
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,440
so that's that's a cyber security uh

305
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,600
concern and so we have techniques to

306
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,040
protect that part

307
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,560
whether it be it doesn't matter what the

308
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,060
part is on the airplane but we want to

309
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,500
know what we're installing is what we

310
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,640
built

311
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,820
okay uh four years ago I would have said

312
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,760
part of the security here is uh

313
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,440
requirements we have for every supplier

314
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,420
to protect their source code because we

315
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,040
don't want the source code Rob

316
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,839
that's an intellectual property issue

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,880
and uh

318
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,760
financial concern but it's also a cyber

319
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,079
concern because we don't want a bad guy

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,640
to get the source code for like flight

321
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
controls and go alter that and then try

322
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,860
to inject that new part into the system

323
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,959
but unfortunately the bad guys have

324
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,540
gotten smart enough where that that's a

325
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,060
realized life present threat today even

326
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,440
if they don't steal the source code

327
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,779
there's capability to reverse engineer

328
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,120
some of the loadable parts

329
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,240
and that you know that's a pretty recent

330
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,680
um that you know may have been a nation

331
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,139
state event four years ago but man did

332
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,760
that change fast and that you know

333
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,920
that's a big deal

334
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,579
um

335
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,680
look at the airplanes and you see all

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,060
these arrows pointing at the airplane

337
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,120
from the ground all the pathways so our

338
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,800
customers want those airplanes to be

339
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,940
connected

340
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,040
so you would say why on Earth would they

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
want that well

342
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,380
um

343
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,360
the first thing they hit me with is hey

344
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,579
I get in the car and my cell phone

345
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,320
connects to the car why can't I have all

346
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,639
that on the airplane

347
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,440
well one you're not going to get all

348
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,720
that because of uh some things we can't

349
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,100
protect so we're not going to offer that

350
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,880
feature flat out and and that's been

351
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,800
some yucky discussions with Airlines but

352
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,720
that's where we are I'm just not going

353
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,300
to do it or yeah I can do it but here's

354
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,480
what that means so it's not as simple

355
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,300
uh the techniques we use as your iPhone

356
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,279
is pretty easy you know it connects

357
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,779
pretty easy almost on any vehicle

358
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,399
because you're using Bluetooth

359
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,160
and one of the Apple products are

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,500
Android products depending on that that

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,899
car company has installed

362
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,440
our our connectivity is very onerous and

363
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,260
again it has to be for cyber reasons and

364
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,779
it's also very deterministic

365
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,540
so so even though it connects Angry

366
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,519
Birds is not going to be roaming around

367
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,720
on that airplane

368
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,480
the airplane won't allow it it's looking

369
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,820
for that possibility and it's just not

370
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,260
going to allow it and there's techniques

371
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,300
we use to prevent that but that's part

372
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,519
of the certification

373
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,320
um and that that I talked about was on

374
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,839
the airplane so that's a flight crew use

375
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,760
we want to allow our flight attendants

376
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,500
to have that same connectivity

377
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,660
and and your question for either one of

378
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,820
those are you know why do they want the

379
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,519
connectivity well the flight crew if you

380
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,260
guys you guys may not remember but the

381
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,000
ones in the back do

382
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,740
flight crew used to carry what we call

383
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,600
flight backs with them and there were

384
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,300
charts in those bags and so the industry

385
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
with the introduction of the iPad and

386
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,260
there's competing devices in the windows

387
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,540
but the iPad Apple's device is the

388
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,680
dominating

389
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,199
uh it's called electronic black bag but

390
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,880
it's the dominating use in the airlines

391
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,980
it's over 500 000 of them out there

392
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,100
today worldwide and apple is an

393
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,860
excellent support of us in in helping

394
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,320
that be the dominant

395
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,940
device

396
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,880
so when I was flying

397
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,260
literally

398
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,720
on my flight I would have to think about

399
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,779
how to fold my charts

400
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,540
because in a t-38 the last thing you

401
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,760
want the charts in my glare ski I can't

402
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,260
see anything and I'm I mean I'm all

403
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,820
trimmed up I know I'm playing level but

404
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,320
I have no idea who's out there whatever

405
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,019
because I'm looking at my map not okay

406
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,199
so I would fold my map such a way and it

407
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,579
you know sometimes it took plot

408
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,740
depending on my route so that I could

409
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,500
turn that map quickly flip over there's

410
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,740
none of this glare shield in my face

411
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,139
uh activity and and because I'm the only

412
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,959
pilot I'm the only one uh where you know

413
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,399
the commercial guys had it easy they

414
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,139
could have a co-pilot or who's ever not

415
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,600
flying open the map so all that's been

416
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,240
digitized it's all on the iPad and so if

417
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
you give them connectivity they get GPS

418
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,399
signal and those lazy Pilots today the

419
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,720
iPad just followed right along they

420
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,339
don't have to worry about any stuff that

421
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,139
you know 30 years ago I had to worry

422
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,459
about

423
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,880
um really neat feature and then another

424
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,459
new feature is with the connectivity to

425
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,079
the airplane we can also provide

426
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
connectivity off the airplane

427
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,420
so they can go get implant weather data

428
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,160
and Southwest I'll give them all the

429
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,620
credit they monetize that in-flight

430
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,760
connection

431
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,160
and how they did it was by you getting

432
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
that weather data the crew got more

433
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
active accurate data about turbulence

434
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,579
when I flew turbulence data was hey I'm

435
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,040
over the Rockies at 40 000 feet and I've

436
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
got rough turbulence well we're over

437
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,459
there you know you want to ask where are

438
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,380
the Rockies but that's the report we got

439
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,540
so I'm like it looks like I'm over the

440
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,680
Rockies I guess I've got to get ready

441
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,000
for turbulence

442
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,540
well today they get the same graphic

443
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,240
detailed weather that you get watching

444
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,160
TV you know when the thunderstorms

445
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,680
rolling in here to West Lafayette and

446
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
from that they're able to make better

447
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,880
predictions from the airplane and I

448
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,079
don't know if you guys know it but the

449
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,699
seat belt sign comes on a lot more than

450
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,800
it used to be well by doing that

451
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
Southwest was able to show that their

452
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,660
in-flight injury rate was reduced by 60

453
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,520
percent

454
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,799
and so they took that data and said hey

455
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,799
bosses thank you for paying Boeing for

456
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,559
this connectivity because we've now uh

457
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,540
earned it I mean it's paid for itself

458
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,220
our will

459
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,500
and and so that's an idea of what that

460
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
feature set allows all right so those of

461
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,359
you that are cyber aware like wait a

462
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,380
minute

463
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,380
where's that connection endpoint go

464
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,660
who's protecting that info

465
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,200
what if that endpoint gets compromised

466
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,320
and so the good news is is Boeing says

467
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,820
hey Mr Airline if you're going to have

468
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,260
that endpoint here's the rules you have

469
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,580
to have associated with that endpoint

470
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,500
and then we assume they don't follow

471
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,240
those rules

472
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,160
I mean that's what we have to do so that

473
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,140
if that endpoint is hacked it's not

474
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,160
going to come back in through that

475
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,480
endpoint and do something to the

476
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,559
airplane

477
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,600
all right so I'm talking high level but

478
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,820
but I love this chart because this just

479
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,500
shows you the convoluted mess that the

480
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,380
industry has all right a question I'm

481
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,539
asked a lot you know hey um

482
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,360
Windows found a cve you guys know what a

483
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,280
cve is

484
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,200
yeah I know you guys do tell them

485
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,880
assessment

486
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,280
so so

487
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,200
code no matter who builds it

488
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,059
has vulnerabilities

489
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,539
and we have an industry Forum Windows as

490
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,720
an example even iPhone where folks are

491
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,100
out looking for those vulnerabilities

492
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
and and the good guys report

493
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,580
and then the owner of that code Apple

494
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Microsoft following whoever we get that

495
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,160
data and then we analyze it well so what

496
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,080
Boeing does is we analyze if any of the

497
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,940
cves apply to any of the software we

498
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,760
have on the airplane we analyze it and

499
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,280
we and that vulnerability in most cases

500
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,740
I will reassure you does not have any

501
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,140
effect on our system based on the nature

502
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,460
of our design

503
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,340
but we and we commit to the FAA and

504
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,620
ourselves and and our other regulatory

505
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,140
agencies that we're looking at those

506
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,299
so

507
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,100
um let's say

508
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,799
I deliver a system tomorrow

509
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
and then we go look at that system three

510
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,220
weeks from now

511
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,100
there could be 400 CVS I gave you a

512
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,260
really insane big number but but there

513
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,200
are CVS found every day and so we

514
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,880
analyze on each and every one of those

515
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,580
and we may make the decision that we're

516
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,020
safe to fly

517
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,140
but we when we go make an update to our

518
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,520
systems we will be expected by our owner

519
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,100
selves and the regulator to address

520
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,679
those cves because what could happen is

521
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,200
as they grow and grow and grow you can

522
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,520
eventually get to a point where you do

523
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,320
have an issue even if each one

524
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
individually is not an issue the

525
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
collective could be could present a

526
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,020
problem

527
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,840
well in aviation I can't run out and

528
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
patch that airplane there's no such

529
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,539
process

530
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,820
the process we use to update airplanes

531
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,400
is over 50 years and it's proven to be

532
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,380
very reliable and it's a very good

533
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,120
process I'm going to Advocate it's a

534
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,740
very good process

535
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,080
but the challenge and that and that

536
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,460
leads to the challenge why there's some

537
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,020
things we just don't do because we know

538
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,900
we can't do a patch type method

539
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,059
the worst thing you would want to do and

540
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,799
and even Microsoft you can read about

541
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,780
where they fixed a CBE made a big deal

542
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,880
about it advertised and it broke

543
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,260
something else

544
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,780
can't handle that in aviation

545
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,240
so even if I were to update

546
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,860
I mean it doesn't matter what software

547
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,440
update I make the Cyber guys are my best

548
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,059
buddies and they're testing the stew out

549
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,039
of what we're doing to make sure that we

550
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,299
fixed what we said and we didn't

551
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,340
introduce another vulnerability

552
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,380
for what we know

553
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,780
again I can't test the unknown

554
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,179
and and the unknown is real too because

555
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,400
the bad guys can know about some

556
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,260
vulnerability and they just nobody else

557
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,520
knows yet and they're rubbing their

558
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
hands together

559
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,179
you know we're pee so so we have to

560
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,220
anticipate that as well

561
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,580
does that give you an idea of the issues

562
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,160
with Aviation

563
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,280
so that's a difference where you know my

564
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,100
laptop at Boeing I get update security

565
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,020
updates and my cell phone

566
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,600
you know almost every day sometimes

567
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
yeah I don't have that luxury in

568
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,340
aviation

569
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,360
one of the

570
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,960
um one of the protection methods we have

571
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,000
is we divide our systems into domains

572
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,220
and this is from an air Inc document so

573
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,820
this is not not proprietary so the Pi's

574
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,760
domain Pastor entertainment system so

575
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,679
that's how your iPad logs on on your

576
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,640
flight

577
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,340
for airplanes that still have Ife where

578
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,559
you can watch TV you know embedded in

579
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,600
the airplane that's that domain

580
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,340
the industry made a decision that we're

581
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,260
going to continue to leave it somewhat

582
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,720
unregulated meaning it's a design

583
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,700
Assurance level E so fairly unregulated

584
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,220
because of that the limit the limit of

585
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,100
the connected ability is great so we're

586
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,020
we're not giving them and and you guys

587
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,220
may have read

588
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,200
you know some scientists somewhere

589
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,940
claims that they were able to move a

590
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,100
play control system by hacking into the

591
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,140
video system

592
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,600
not on the Boeing airplanes and and yeah

593
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,100
I've had to deal with a lot of those and

594
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,880
I've worked with the different

595
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
Regulatory Agencies and the government

596
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,559
FBI others to prove that you know

597
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,059
somebody's claim is an accurate because

598
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,000
we take them all serious we have to but

599
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
you won't see us in news media

600
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,419
responding to that you know it's not in

601
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,419
our best interest to do that but we we

602
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,460
basically have those systems isolated

603
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,679
because the industry wanted to be able

604
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,799
to act fast and provide you know the

605
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
latest 802 whatever or

606
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,480
video streaming capability because it's

607
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,520
a highly competitive area you know from

608
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,120
airline to airline to Airline

609
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,919
there are links in there but again the

610
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,120
links our protection methods are one way

611
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,580
they're not two-way leads

612
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,200
or if they're two-way there's a lot of

613
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,039
rules

614
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,260
a lot a lot of rooms

615
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,080
um the information domain that's where

616
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,419
most of my team lives

617
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,640
and those are the first line

618
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,260
defenses

619
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,419
so there's a lot of Protections in those

620
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,000
domains there's a lot of testing any

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,039
update any update that's done in that

622
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,559
domain is fully fully tested and then

623
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,299
the Cyber guys show up and they go try

624
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,220
to hack it

625
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,620
you know that's part of our process

626
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,620
the air traffic control domain is fairly

627
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,940
isolated

628
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,500
because that's a safety of flight that's

629
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,419
flight controls we do not want anyone to

630
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,380
ever ever get to flight controls

631
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,860
fmcs display systems note those the

632
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,419
things that are needed for a pilot to

633
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,980
get that airplane from Seattle to

634
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,419
Cleveland

635
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,020
those those are highly highly protected

636
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,720
but there are access points I'm not

637
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,100
going to tell you there aren't but there

638
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,340
are the nature of the design and again

639
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,020
there's a lot of focus on those access

640
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,360
points and limiting them

641
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,799
[Music]

642
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,880
um

643
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,919
that makes sense you guys again this is

644
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,360
an air ring dive so it's not unique to

645
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,740
Boeing

646
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,539
um John Deere

647
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,720
Ford GM they don't have this kind of

648
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
design

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,919
yes sir uh we have a question in uh the

650
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,620
Q a does that isolation that you

651
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,780
mentioned include the seat electronic

652
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,840
box that was part of the uh the Chris

653
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,360
Roberts dust up yeah I know that guy

654
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,439
well ah yes

655
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,059
I'll just keep it simple yep

656
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,440
um

657
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,020
so as I've been sharing now we're going

658
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,760
to get some word charts so that pretty

659
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,860
chart you just looked at

660
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,000
um

661
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,280
yes sir are those segments does that

662
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,159
segmentation physical or logical

663
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,159
we use mode okay but when it's not

664
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,700
physical there there's a lot of focus on

665
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,960
it because that's a potential

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
vulnerability next year

667
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
I mean I I might think I'm good today

668
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,600
but I can't assume I will be next year

669
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,840
and you bring up another good point

670
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,400
um when I when I started working at

671
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,140
Boeing it was not uncommon that you

672
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,520
would go certify an airplane everything

673
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,539
on it

674
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,280
and some Airlines would never never

675
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,140
change it

676
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,299
didn't have to that's not the world

677
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,799
we're in anymore

678
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,419
so if they have an airplane and it's

679
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,559
connected

680
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,380
they will get updates that and the life

681
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,440
and airplanes can last 30 40 years

682
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,120
especially carbon fiber we're expecting

683
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,159
even longer than that for the eight

684
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,000
seven

685
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,380
so

686
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,080
the airlines know and plan for now I'm

687
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,120
sure they update ifb you read them you

688
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,799
know because they want to I mean there

689
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,360
wasn't long ago where believe it or not

690
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,880
before your time maybe but you could get

691
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,039
on any airplane in the United States and

692
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,299
there was no access to movies or email

693
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,640
or any of that well now almost I don't

694
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,900
even know what airplane I've got on

695
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,820
recently that didn't have that

696
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,159
I mean all Airlines now have had that so

697
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,900
the yeah they've invested in that area

698
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,820
and you can look at how that's matured

699
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,240
and changed but this uh domain I just

700
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,620
talked about

701
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,020
the airlines now have to get used to the

702
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,179
components in the AIS domain are going

703
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,039
to have to change to maintain cyber

704
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,020
protections

705
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,320
yeah thank you yeah that question

706
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,179
and that's that's new to the industry

707
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,740
and that and they're not we're not happy

708
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,539
about it because that's not a cheap

709
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,760
thing but that's the reality we're in

710
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,720
or we started have to cut features out

711
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,179
yes feature sets they want and there's

712
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,740
an economic advantage to having this

713
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,120
connectivity I gave you the example the

714
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
pilots and the turbulence there's

715
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,740
there's a lot in the maintenance area a

716
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,559
lot getting heads up data

717
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,500
um so the ecosystem we talked about

718
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,600
you know in insecurity so there aren't

719
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
regulatory requirements for those back

720
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
offices

721
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,880
but but we Levy a lot of requirements on

722
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
the airlines regard them and then like I

723
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,360
said or we assume that they won't follow

724
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,740
them

725
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,659
to protect our airplanes so the number

726
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,179
one thing to protect the airplane

727
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,020
um

728
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,440
information sharing so there there's you

729
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
guys may or may not know but there's a

730
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,760
financial ISAC information sharing

731
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
analysis Center

732
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,240
our Aviation eye seconds patterned after

733
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,279
that and we and we Boeing led the

734
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,740
creation of this but it consists of

735
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,799
Boeing Airbus many of our suppliers I

736
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,120
think there's another chart coming on it

737
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,340
and a lot a lot of our Airlines and

738
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,799
airports they're members of that the

739
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,980
purpose of that is to share the threats

740
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,860
so every time a new thread appears we

741
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,360
share that immediate there's a there's a

742
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,919
distribution method and we know we don't

743
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,360
share our vulnerabilities but we share

744
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,580
our threats and and your credit card

745
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,440
companies part of the financial asset do

746
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,120
the exact same thing

747
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,860
so whatever MasterCard here is about

748
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,059
they're going to share with everybody

749
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,440
else

750
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
and that's how the industry is defeating

751
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,260
this

752
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,299
uh threat

753
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,120
all right and then uh the robust

754
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,440
governance part I'm going to talk a

755
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,179
little more about that so I won't say I

756
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,279
won't say more

757
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,460
um in case you didn't know uh our safety

758
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,840
culture

759
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,620
so if you look at until covet showed up

760
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,500
but every year prior to that there were

761
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,059
more and more flights

762
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,940
it's just amazing amount

763
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,340
and if you look at our history every

764
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,400
year there were less incidents

765
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,159
that's a heck of an achievement

766
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,980
more and more flights less incidents as

767
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,640
time goes we know for security it's

768
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,620
going to go the other way

769
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,539
as time goes on there's going to be more

770
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,860
and more threats

771
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,539
and so I use this chart with the

772
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,820
airlines now the airlines get it but at

773
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,159
one point they were still in denial

774
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,279
I would say every Airline now gets this

775
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,679
some of them through not

776
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,600
bad things happen with the reservation

777
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,740
system or something I'm not going to

778
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,020
mention any names but they learned the

779
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,880
hard way

780
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,320
um

781
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,100
so aviation's heavily regulated so this

782
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,380
is just a timeline of all the guidance

783
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,880
that's appeared

784
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,840
if you look there were things showing up

785
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,919
way even back in 1994.

786
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,960
that's the far left side

787
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,179
and I haven't updated this chart this

788
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,620
has not stopped so I'm going to talk

789
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,779
about some of the other guidance that's

790
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,200
out there

791
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,220
um

792
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm asked this a lot you know what

793
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,760
standards do you use how do you how do

794
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
you agree with the FAA how do you hear

795
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
The Regulators on you know that you've

796
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,220
done what you need to do and that you're

797
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,240
cyber protected you know in the early um

798
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,779
somewhere around 2010 it was a struggle

799
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,940
you know the some of our people are

800
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,440
smarter than the regulator some of the

801
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,580
Regulators thought they were smarter

802
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,779
than us and so it was a real hard

803
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,720
discussion to say have you done enough

804
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,580
and so there's been a lot of Industry

805
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,100
focus on creating guidance material and

806
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,539
the arrow guides are probably familiar

807
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,419
with this but there's you know do is an

808
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,860
air rink I mean these are some of the

809
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,000
guidance materials that are available

810
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,240
but these are ones specific to cyber I

811
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,399
want you to note though the beginning of

812
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,260
it was nist

813
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,539
so one of our presidents

814
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,059
as they recognize cyber was becoming an

815
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,500
increase in threat

816
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,899
went and said nist you're going to

817
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,000
develop the standards for cyber now I

818
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,320
don't know Joel if that's what you guys

819
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,960
teach here or talk about but they were

820
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,539
the start of for industry what we were

821
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,100
going to use and the processes we're

822
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,380
going to use too and that's why I list

823
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,779
these standards and a lot of these dos

824
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,899
are are based on in this approach but

825
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,460
they're they're modified because they're

826
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,500
more specific to Aviation than this you

827
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,179
guys had industry in general

828
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
um

829
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,960
there if if I sent you to go look at the

830
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,100
fars

831
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,899
so the arrow guys know what that is but

832
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,720
the Federal Aviation regulations

833
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
and said go find the regulations on

834
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,799
Cyber

835
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,440
you're not going to see a rule

836
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,740
so the FAA recognizing this wrote

837
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,679
special conditions

838
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,340
they have not put produced the new rule

839
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,840
um the special conditions are public

840
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,279
because they were published through

841
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,600
there but when you look to the far

842
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
you're not going to see far you know

843
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
13-0 whatever that talks about cyber so

844
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,100
there's special conditions and each of

845
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,679
our models there there's a variation on

846
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,460
them

847
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,919
they're not all necessarily the same so

848
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,980
as the bad guys have gotten smarter

849
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,480
there's a little the rules change a

850
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,039
little bit on things what The Regulators

851
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,360
looking for so there's special

852
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,120
conditions they exist for every model

853
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,640
uh they're basically the same but you

854
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,720
know some of the newer models they're

855
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
they're a little different

856
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,980
um when you have a rule those in

857
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,020
aviation you have to get an agreement

858
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,460
with the regulator on methods of

859
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,860
compliance and so these industry

860
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,960
standards are pretty pretty new when

861
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,940
these first came out

862
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,460
yasa which is Europe did not agree with

863
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,299
them

864
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,520
and so there's been the last three years

865
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,559
has been a really really focused effort

866
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,140
to get agreement and that's you know

867
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,700
working group 72 and that's why they're

868
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,440
all rev Aid so now we're finally

869
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,960
harmonized

870
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,419
and and these standards offer more than

871
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,460
one method to show compliance just like

872
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,200
a lot of Standards do

873
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,899
so if you if you get bored and you want

874
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,820
to do some reading you know here you go

875
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,340
good reading

876
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,899
um this is the

877
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,720
uh Aviation ice act so I just had this

878
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,940
chart in here so that you're aware it's

879
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,220
a really it was a non it's a non-profit

880
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,740
just like the financial ISAC and it's

881
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,799
active and and it's out of date of

882
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,600
there's double that number of members

883
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,679
now

884
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,899
but it's a very important aspect in our

885
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,678
Aviation community

886
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,880
So and I've got more charts but I'm

887
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,140
going to summarize here and then let you

888
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,480
guys ask more questions I hope so again

889
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,520
I talked about all this this is just a

890
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,640
summary chart to get off the stage

891
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,179
um

892
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,100
you guys have any questions the rest of

893
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,279
the things are fun mowing things I'd

894
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,899
rather not do those I mean they're fun

895
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,120
but if we can really have an interchange

896
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,880
on Cyber I'd rather do that so okay here

897
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,899
you guys have any questions yeah

898
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:30,500
push that button yeah

899
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,779
okay so you said that the finally do you

900
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,659
have an important company regarding the

901
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,640
cyber security finally which is our

902
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,100
agreement with the European Society

903
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,700
about the cyber security part so

904
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,100
examining is that does that mean that

905
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,439
Boeing and air Plus have a different

906
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,980
and that method of compliance so all

907
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,299
that documentation allows those

908
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,179
different approaches yeah we we learned

909
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,299
early on that we had disagreement

910
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,179
on what was not the rigor but the

911
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,980
approach to the rigor

912
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,359
and so

913
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:15,480
um as a community we've agreed that both

914
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,040
are are good

915
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,560
and so the these allow different

916
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,719
approaches

917
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,399
so you could ask me which one's better

918
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,780
and I'm not going to give you an opinion

919
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,560
well I will probably but but that's not

920
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,599
unusual I mean in the regulatory

921
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,580
environment there's a number of other

922
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,139
things like eme there's different

923
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,199
approaches in some areas that you can

924
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,098
so yeah

925
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,179
yeah uh thank you for your presentation

926
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,300
so in your previous previous slide you

927
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,980
mentioned that information sharing will

928
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,320
be very important and critical so could

929
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,179
you explain more about what is the

930
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,159
purpose of the information sharing and

931
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,780
yeah so that that ISAC is a community of

932
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,940
other isacs

933
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,339
so the financial one is an easy example

934
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,260
because all of us have credit cards all

935
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,480
of us have a bank somewhere in the world

936
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,200
that's the financial ISAC they have a

937
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,119
link to the aviation eye sex so they

938
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,800
identify vulnerability are not

939
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,560
vulnerabilities but threats in

940
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
maybe they have a Linux system they're

941
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,980
using they're finding that there's a

942
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,599
hack out there

943
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,460
they will communicate to the aviation

944
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,920
and vice versa

945
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,740
um the aviation Isaac important part

946
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,839
includes the airports

947
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,180
so you know security issues that occur

948
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,859
at the airports are going to be shared

949
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,480
you know threats regarding those

950
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,980
security issues will be shared in that

951
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,160
ice Act and and it and the value of that

952
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,740
is an airline might go

953
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,460
okay I don't have that system but

954
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,220
as they analyze it they may decide you

955
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,320
know what my reservation system uses

956
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,119
aspects in my code or my architecture of

957
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,800
what you got hacked

958
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,720
you know what that threat was not what

959
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,180
you got hacked and then we're allowed

960
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,240
together to address them

961
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,400
so maybe the bad guy doesn't know about

962
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
that Airlines problem yet but they found

963
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,380
the airport one as an example you know

964
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,720
then the airline can maybe fix it and

965
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,700
and therefore not not have that

966
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,220
propagate into what they uh got or

967
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,960
Boeing for them

968
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,000
or one of our suppliers

969
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,579
for the same value of the iPhone for the

970
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,560
sake of our students uh both in the room

971
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,180
and and viewing and those viewing

972
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,400
afterwards when this is a recording

973
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
um you can Google or or do a search for

974
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,960
ISAC there are a number of them for many

975
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,240
of the industries especially those that

976
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,560
are critical uh to to National Security

977
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,680
uh Aviation ISAC that Mr huffaker is

978
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,900
talking about but at the base level it's

979
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,720
where uh even competitors within the

980
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,060
industry can share information now they

981
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,800
don't give away competitive advantage to

982
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,320
each other but they say hey someone is

983
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,820
trying to get into our Network and this

984
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,800
is how we've seen they do it or someone

985
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,140
has tried to subvert our product and

986
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,180
this is what we've discovered and so

987
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,700
they share that the entire industry can

988
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
become safer and learn from each other

989
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,660
now they don't necessarily say hey

990
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,280
here's our new product that's coming out

991
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,079
and it's going to be fantastic what

992
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,760
we're going to do to fix it yeah they

993
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,140
don't they don't share that it's they

994
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,240
they share what they see as potential

995
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,400
vulnerabilities from a site primarily

996
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,800
from a cyber perspective and you need to

997
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,540
do that I mean I can't say enough and

998
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,359
thank you thank you sir

999
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,560
because the bad guys are doing the same

1000
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,400
thing

1001
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
you know they are they're out hey I

1002
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,900
found this

1003
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,300
let's you know until we find an exploit

1004
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,320
somewhere

1005
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,880
well that you know so it's yeah it's

1006
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,359
proven to work very very well

1007
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,579
and any again an easy example is the

1008
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,320
financial industry yeah yeah things do

1009
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,500
occur but they recover rather quickly

1010
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,599
thank you anyway yeah that's a long way

1011
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,540
any other questions

1012
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,640
Yeah we actually have two more questions

1013
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,640
in the Q a

1014
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,880
first one is there any consistent

1015
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,339
vendor-wide effort to understand which

1016
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,740
data types might run into constraints

1017
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,660
due to the number of digits available

1018
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,599
for instance the 10-bit counter that

1019
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,119
counts weeks in older GPS satellites

1020
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,520
leading to the date rolling over every

1021
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,700
20 years or so

1022
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,480
um

1023
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,400
it's a good question

1024
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,060
um

1025
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,640
I won't say that we're looking at 2035

1026
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,460
that way or anything like that um

1027
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,220
so so yeah I I'll give you a short

1028
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,040
answer yes there's consideration but it

1029
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,880
is a real a real issue

1030
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,240
um some of the so not not long ago we

1031
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,480
went from what 16 to 32-bit uh windows I

1032
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,619
mean I think that was the wind that was

1033
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,400
that Windows 10 or 11 or whatever update

1034
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,859
but that was one of the main reasons and

1035
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,079
and that that helps address this date

1036
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,119
issue

1037
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,880
so uh we we know we have another one

1038
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,579
coming not just us but the financial

1039
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,079
everybody

1040
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,680
so uh we'll we'll we're expecting we'll

1041
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,540
get an industry-wide agreement and

1042
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,160
solution from that and then that's what

1043
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,540
we'll use

1044
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,460
so I don't have anyone specifically at

1045
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,500
Boeing other than recognition of it

1046
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,660
working on that item because we know

1047
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,160
where the software we have that we're

1048
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,460
going to get a holistic answer from

1049
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,500
you know from the industry

1050
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,960
whether it be Windows Linux whatever you

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,700
know whatever we need

1052
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,720
what was the other question

1053
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,619
so

1054
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,540
um what is going to be the biggest

1055
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,520
challenge in designing and maintaining

1056
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,440
cyber security systems and Boeing

1057
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
airplanes in the next decade

1058
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,040
well I wish I could look ahead and know

1059
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,619
for sure but like I said earlier there's

1060
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,359
things I can't do now that I could do

1061
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,800
four years ago

1062
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,700
I I want to maintain staying ahead of

1063
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,079
that because I don't want to continue to

1064
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,540
do that to turn things off

1065
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,579
we're not anticipating the ability to do

1066
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,260
it so

1067
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,140
these standards that came out are going

1068
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,480
to help you know the industry convince

1069
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,040
ourselves that we're doing all the right

1070
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,960
things

1071
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,740
um

1072
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,920
that it it will convince the regulatory

1073
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,300
environment that it would follow these

1074
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,380
standards that we're doing the right

1075
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,359
thing so yeah let me let me give you

1076
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,980
another example of why I think that's

1077
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,119
important

1078
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,420
so again when I graduated software was

1079
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,460
relatively new to the industry

1080
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,619
I participated in the 90s in the

1081
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,140
meetings with The Regulators on

1082
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,760
you want to what

1083
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,560
put Hardware on the plane and change the

1084
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,380
software and not roll the part number no

1085
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,000
we're not going to agree to that and

1086
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,220
like hey that's where we're going

1087
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,260
and they're and I'm not talking that was

1088
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,940
a half hour's worth of conversation I

1089
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,359
mean that took years to gain agreement

1090
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,220
with the regulator that this is where

1091
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,260
we're going so today I have Hardware

1092
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,480
platforms and I can put different

1093
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,640
software on that platform

1094
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,280
that it's entirely different function

1095
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,660
it performs an entirely different

1096
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,099
function but back in the 90s we didn't

1097
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,900
have that luxury we were expected to

1098
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,820
roll the hardware partner

1099
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,740
and so we worked through the industry on

1100
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,200
the ability to create

1101
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,000
um software part numbers because that

1102
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,880
did not exist and how we manage them all

1103
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,859
right the next thing is well how do you

1104
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,200
develop that software so for those of

1105
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,240
you are narrow you're familiar with some

1106
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,859
of our design requirements require 10

1107
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,599
and the minus 9. our ability to show

1108
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,520
that 10 to the minus 9 or 10 to minus 12

1109
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,160
depending on what the part is uh margin

1110
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,480
is safety

1111
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,040
okay well you can't do that with

1112
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,180
software

1113
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,920
you can stare at it all day you want

1114
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,180
when you're not going to get a 10 in the

1115
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,160
minus whatever out of it maybe reality

1116
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,500
I'm trying to be funny but it doesn't

1117
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,020
exist so the with the industry we

1118
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,760
develop software developer that's where

1119
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,619
the Dow level design Assurance levels

1120
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,740
come in the do 178 process was invented

1121
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,400
in the 90s to to get agreement on how to

1122
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,440
build critical systems with software

1123
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,599
that met 10 to the minus 12 or whatever

1124
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,040
it needed to be

1125
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,980
and so that's what Journey we're on now

1126
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,320
with cyber to do the same kind of use

1127
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,599
the same processes and say okay we're

1128
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,820
we're relatively assured that what

1129
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,200
you've done

1130
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,500
in the industry is going to be cyber

1131
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,300
state

1132
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,000
so Jim asked us question knowing that an

1133
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,579
entire uh future seminar could be

1134
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,339
devoted to it so so forgive me and and

1135
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:34,200
probably asking you to provide a simple

1136
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,839
answer and to not a very simple topic

1137
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,240
area at least but one of the areas that

1138
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,920
I find extremely interesting when it

1139
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,740
comes to Aero cyber uh is that you have

1140
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,760
planes from multiple manufacturers from

1141
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,560
multiple countries who are landing at

1142
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,180
shared airports all across the world

1143
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,820
including

1144
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,260
um uh aircraft from one nation who is

1145
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,140
landing in an adversarial airspace or

1146
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,020
adversarial country they all wheel up to

1147
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,880
the airport and plug in

1148
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,599
and download and onload information is

1149
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,880
are there adequate protections or or

1150
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,060
what is being done to to to address this

1151
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,640
issue or or is it an issue and and

1152
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,359
having uh various countries various uh

1153
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,119
Brands All Views airports around the

1154
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,300
world and plug into them so cool

1155
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,760
um yeah it could be a session

1156
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,980
who are we protecting the airport or the

1157
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,099
airplane

1158
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,400
right both huh well so so a regulatory

1159
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,660
focus is protecting an airplane

1160
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,339
but if but if an airline our country

1161
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,619
decided to use that airplane as a method

1162
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,300
to do something

1163
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,440
and

1164
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,960
and the airport and so they're again

1165
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,060
their memory remember the aviation ice

1166
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,980
act but the airport's certainly is

1167
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,380
concerned about

1168
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,420
um I mean I would I I've not been

1169
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,220
involved those discussions but I gotta

1170
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,920
expect that they would not assume that

1171
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,359
the airplane is always safe

1172
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,520
so you know an easy analogy to compare

1173
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,740
and allow me to bring it up is is this

1174
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,220
so you you guys go buy a laptop right

1175
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,040
you expect when you buy whoever it is I

1176
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,020
won't mention any names but you expect

1177
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,660
it to be cyber clean when you buy it

1178
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,300
you expect that there have been stories

1179
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,819
about this manufacturer that not are

1180
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,520
having things in it uh but but our

1181
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,079
customer expectations are going to be

1182
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,460
clean so when we deliver our airplane

1183
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,220
for Boeing we know the customer expects

1184
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,260
it to be cyber clean

1185
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,380
all right like a laptop if I have

1186
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,980
connectivity so I protected it but it's

1187
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,079
a joint from that moment on when I

1188
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,400
deliver it just like when you take that

1189
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,980
laptop home and you get a let's say you

1190
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,900
get some kind of virus that next night

1191
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,060
and you go back to the store I don't

1192
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,099
want it it's got a virus you know most

1193
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,079
stores are going to go I'm not talking

1194
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,460
to you

1195
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,920
what'd you do and and they didn't want

1196
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,180
to hear it well

1197
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,280
it's a little different Aviation we want

1198
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,740
to talk about it but we do expect and

1199
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,420
provide guidance to the airline to

1200
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,339
maintain that airplane to be cyber

1201
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,619
secure

1202
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,660
um I don't know if yeah that's I mean

1203
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,940
that's a really good I don't know if

1204
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,440
there's

1205
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,740
bad guy scheming to use an airplane as I

1206
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,960
don't know I I gotta bet they are

1207
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,339
so I would I would hope the airport

1208
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:31,619
would protect themselves I like your

1209
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:35,040
analogy uh because because it does work

1210
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,500
in helping picture this so not only and

1211
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,060
I ask the nature of my question was

1212
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,500
thinking that one of your planes would

1213
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,680
roll up and and could something in the

1214
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,780
airport system whether it was there from

1215
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,599
a government action an error or a

1216
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,220
previous plane that was plugging in that

1217
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,220
downloaded something that was built to

1218
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,000
upload to certain aircraft or whatever

1219
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,220
but uh but yeah I had never really

1220
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,680
thought about that uh it wasn't just to

1221
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,540
affect the plane but it could be the

1222
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,099
plane could just be the delivery method

1223
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,380
that hooks in and is just trying to uh

1224
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,839
wreak havoc on ground systems within an

1225
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,400
airport

1226
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,319
thank you Jim

1227
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,839
one of the one of the methods that we do

1228
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,660
use is its endpoints are important I

1229
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,520
mean the Cyber guys know this

1230
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,920
so it's the end point the pathway is

1231
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,960
important too so there's really good

1232
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,180
protections today because again I can

1233
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,980
grab my Boeing laptop well I got it

1234
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,260
right here I'm going through Purdue's

1235
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,460
internet

1236
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,319
and if I I'm not talking to Boeing today

1237
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,839
but if I were there are encryption

1238
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,640
techniques that Boeing uses for that

1239
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,960
connection

1240
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,119
to ensure that

1241
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,460
whatever I'm sending here that says

1242
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,740
proprietary on it and goes all the way

1243
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,660
back to Seattle or wherever a Boeing

1244
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,780
system is can be intercepted but they

1245
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,819
can't read it I mean that's on the TLs

1246
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,760
and all the methods for that a lot of

1247
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,420
that applies to the airplane so we know

1248
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,920
we know that you know somebody might be

1249
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,480
sitting at an airport and going to try

1250
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,180
to disrupt that connection okay

1251
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,339
I still can get to Cleveland safely I

1252
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,859
can still leave Cleveland safely

1253
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:13,800
I mean that's part of our our design

1254
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,500
um it might economically affect the

1255
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,480
airline when when she wafer but it's not

1256
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,940
going to fix safety we can't allow it to

1257
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,880
do that can they read the data that's a

1258
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,260
little more important

1259
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,359
but we do we do techniques to make sure

1260
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,680
that they can't read the data whether

1261
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,560
it's following data GE data any of our

1262
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,180
other suppliers but content on that

1263
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,380
airplane

1264
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,300
and then a lot of the airlines we give

1265
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,740
them guidance when it when it reaches

1266
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,000
that endpoint

1267
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,220
and what they need to do

1268
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,040
to protect that data and they and they

1269
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,079
all view that data as their data when an

1270
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,400
airplane when an airline buys an

1271
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,079
airplane it doesn't matter who makes the

1272
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,339
data

1273
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,440
that's their operation I mean I've been

1274
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,060
yelled at so many times and I'm just

1275
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,280
reiterating it is there the airlines are

1276
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,440
adamant it is our data

1277
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,380
your system generated it for me it's now

1278
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,700
mine

1279
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,920
so if you want access to it you're going

1280
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,200
to ask permission

1281
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,819
and we have that permission in a lot of

1282
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,579
cases but I'm just you know it gets ugly

1283
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:12,420
quick

1284
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,520
unlike your car

1285
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,920
I mean that car collects a lot of data

1286
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,380
and you don't have access to it Ford

1287
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,079
won't let you have access to it

1288
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,720
you know try to get out of Fordham

1289
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,819
maintenance manual

1290
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,460
you're going to pay dearly for that

1291
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,220
yeah well that's not how we operate

1292
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,440
anyway

1293
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,640
that was a long-winded answer

1294
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,700
um one more quick one is that

1295
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,520
um and again I as you know I am not uh

1296
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,300
an aero cyber guy so but I find that the

1297
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,220
Topic's interesting so I do understand

1298
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,140
the concept that when you're doing

1299
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,960
anything with a flight system or

1300
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,960
platform uh that the the three major

1301
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,119
concerns of the three driving areas are

1302
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,500
what power

1303
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,420
space

1304
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:08,160
power space and wait thank you so are

1305
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,040
there formalized formulas or what have

1306
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
you uh especially when it comes to cyber

1307
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,940
one I mean because you know the old

1308
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,040
adage is all well God we could we could

1309
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,319
build this unbelievable Network and you

1310
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:20,579
know we just don't we just won't be able

1311
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:21,960
to have any seats on this Airline

1312
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,760
because we're going to make it so secure

1313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,920
uh that that there are obviously some

1314
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,599
trade-offs but is there a formalized

1315
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,280
thing or is it still Orange formalized

1316
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,960
in trying to figure out where the

1317
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,359
trade-off on those three factors are

1318
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,940
when it comes to cyber it's not as

1319
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,339
difficult so the answer is yes it's not

1320
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,140
as difficult as you say

1321
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,260
um they're like I showed in that domain

1322
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,020
separation we want the Pi's domain to be

1323
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,359
unregulated so we treat our cyber

1324
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,920
community treats it already as

1325
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,660
compromised

1326
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,300
but but in reality can an airline afford

1327
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,280
to have all our credit cards stolen when

1328
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,420
they

1329
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,680
no

1330
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,180
so they're you know we're we're

1331
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,680
expecting them working with their

1332
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,060
provider to make sure that doesn't

1333
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,220
happen in flight

1334
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,619
and and it has that was an easy example

1335
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,200
things that happened we we and the

1336
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,640
industry decided that we wanted to

1337
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,160
maintain that un theoretically

1338
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,839
unregulated it's regulated don't get me

1339
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,119
wrong but but it's not as regulated as

1340
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,680
the rest of the airplane but that

1341
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,020
unregulated environment and so therefore

1342
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,240
we we just assume flat out that it's

1343
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,220
compromise

1344
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,960
and that's why we don't do some of the

1345
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,300
things the airlines asked me to do

1346
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,099
and I see that we have come to the end

1347
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,680
of the class Mr huffaker thank you very

1348
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,079
much for joining us today thanks again

1349
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,220
thanks for having me
