I don't say get out of the way but give

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,760
you a little bit of a perspective my I'm

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,260
actually a political Scientist by

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,579
training

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,920
um I finished my PhD at the University

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,899
of Chicago

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,860
um

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,860
in 2015 when I went off but I did have

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,000
an appointment in the computer science

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,379
department at Southern Methodist

29
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,719
University I'm all I also come from a

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,820
background where computers programming

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,319
and things like that

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,540
um were part of my growing up time and

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,100
so I kind of come by my geekiness

34
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,540
naturally at the school of advanced Air

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,540
and Space studies I am we don't have

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,340
official designations but I am The

37
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,680
Unofficial uh cyber security and

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,460
information uh Power uh professor and we

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,860
teach Air Force officers and other

40
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,000
Military Officers and we've had even one

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,880
civilian student but we prepare them to

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,880
go take positions as strategists and so

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,340
strategists in this case means specific

44
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,799
jobs that you can take in the military

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,600
and those jobs are related to

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,780
International strategy uh so I spent a

47
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,460
lot of time talking to working with and

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,780
around

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,060
um military folks um

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,619
that said

51
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,920
oh I would like to proper my geek

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
Bonafide this is one of those times when

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,640
having a way to see if you were laughing

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,200
would be helpful

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,759
um but the uh the uh I really do use Vim

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,520
I really am a Debian guy

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
um although I usually will use Mentor

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,780
Ubuntu and I did see the original

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,540
trilogy in theaters all three of them uh

60
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,739
if you have to ask which original

61
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,420
trilogy I don't know that we can be

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,440
friends but uh the uh that also dates me

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
as much as anything else

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,459
um I also need to tell you that I am all

65
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,020
the while I do work for the US

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,060
government I am not representing any

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,940
branch group anything like that

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,440
um my these are just My Views as a as a

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,680
private citizen uh that is informed by

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,860
my research and my um uh my uh

71
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,200
uh my work that I do

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,319
in this area it does not reflect policy

73
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,080
preferences strategy anything

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,879
um however while I'm not representing

75
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,980
the federal government I am representing

76
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,500
Alabama so Roll Tide

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,720
um again these are the jokes I hope

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
you're laughing

79
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,200
um so one of the questions that a lot of

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,739
people would would ask uh me in

81
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,660
environments like this is is there such

82
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,340
a thing as information war or is there

83
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,519
information war and are we losing and

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,840
that we can mean a lot of different

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,459
things I recognize that there are people

86
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,739
from all over the world here uh perhaps

87
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,360
physically all over the world right now

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
given um that we're online

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
uh and the

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,920
uh

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,459
and if you Google on uh if you Google it

92
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,420
you're gonna get a lot of different

93
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,340
answers this is some of the answers that

94
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,319
came up on my machine which was probably

95
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,760
tailored to me

96
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,620
um but people are gonna say yes we're

97
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,959
losing we're winning and in fact in the

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,760
military if you look up uh if you were

99
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,220
to say the US is losing the information

100
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,920
war or the cyber security War you would

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
see a lot of people it's become like a

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
cottage industry

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,019
of saying why these uh why the U.S is so

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,299
far behind we're losing out to a lot of

105
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,340
these other folks now I cannot say for

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,340
certain that the US and its allies are

107
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,519
not however in essentially every case

108
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,500
that I see of these um claims they focus

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,880
on military or military-like uses and so

110
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,738
if you spend enough time around National

111
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,380
Security cyber security folks they will

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,419
talk a lot about

113
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,400
um cyber attacks and infiltrations

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,220
they'll use the words of air strikes and

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,360
and Espionage and that's true that's not

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,620
wrong

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,419
um and of course the military does use

118
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,699
information and so it's not strange that

119
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,759
we would start using the verbiage of

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,000
information uh in the military when we

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,940
think about National Security but

122
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,540
cyber security and information are not a

123
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,600
sub-component of the military and in

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,759
fact they're much broader than this

125
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,060
so many of you may have heard or many of

126
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,740
you may have not have heard of the

127
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,040
taxonomy of dime not this dime but it is

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,780
the uh the dime that has a uh it is a

129
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,300
way of thinking about National Power and

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,940
in that National Power you have

131
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,120
diplomacy information military and

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,759
economic power those are the four

133
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,280
components of National Power in this

134
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,639
taxonomy uh and that's how the US and

135
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,259
many other countries think about it it

136
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,000
comes up all the time in foreign policy

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
discussions and you'll note that

138
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
military is part of it but economic

139
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,380
diplomacy and information are co-equal

140
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,060
parts of that

141
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,060
and so you might want to ask the

142
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,440
question well how do these different

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,020
components of power create National

144
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,520
Power

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,780
um well

146
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,280
one of the reason we think about the

147
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,199
military so much is because it is the

148
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,600
military that creates effects and I want

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,460
to broaden this out here because in the

150
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,120
dime taxonomy we use military because if

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,740
it weren't military it wouldn't fit into

152
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,900
dime but what we really mean is

153
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,539
instrumental power the power to do

154
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,220
things so it may or may not be the

155
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,539
military and in fact some of the things

156
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,419
that the U.S military or NATO militaries

157
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,639
do will be done by other organizations

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,160
and sometimes organizations in these

159
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,380
other countries will do what is done by

160
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,139
the military elsewhere so uh for example

161
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,860
the FBI in the U.S and I believe it's

162
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,780
MI6 is counterintelligence those are

163
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,539
both civilian agencies in some countries

164
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,660
that would be uh that would be handled

165
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,300
by the military and the ability to

166
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,919
create

167
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
uh effects is military power

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
and so given that a lot of times we're

169
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
talking about effects resisting effects

170
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,819
it makes sense to think about the

171
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,180
military but they're in power economy

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,780
the economic power does a lot as well

173
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,000
the economy how large our economy

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,340
determines how much effects how many

175
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,900
effects a state our government can

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,919
create so if you are in a rich country

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,800
uh like the us or China Great Britain

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,080
and actually even Mexico comparatively

179
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,360
on the world stage the state the

180
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,699
government has a lot of

181
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,819
um nuclear not nuclear I'm sorry a lot

182
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,080
of uh Power to an ability to do a lot of

183
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,180
things that a comparatively poor country

184
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,759
uh might not have diplomacy is

185
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,039
interesting because what it does is it

186
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,380
shapes where you need to have these

187
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,199
effects in general you want to have lots

188
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,660
of allies and few enemies and then you

189
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,580
can conserve your effort where you need

190
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,740
to using your economic and military

191
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,479
power and information which we'll get to

192
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,860
in a moment

193
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,080
uh so that you aren't expending it

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,780
anywhere and also diplomacy is a way for

195
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,639
countries that maybe are not that

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,580
powerful inherently to

197
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,039
um punch above their weight class and so

198
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,840
we see a lot of smaller European

199
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
countries because they're members of

200
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,660
NATO have taken on an especially

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,120
important role uh in this context

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,300
Estonia is notable because they are have

203
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
worked their way into becoming one of

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,680
the more important Partners in NATO for

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,860
cyber security uh and that is yes they

206
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,180
have a good economy and they have a

207
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,099
competent military but that is diplomacy

208
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,479
working in their favor

209
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,539
but information information power itself

210
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,300
that affects how efficient

211
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,060
everything else is it it changes

212
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,660
efficiency and so let me oh dang it this

213
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,700
is not the the New Order didn't come

214
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,500
through so how does information create

215
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,360
efficiency

216
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,700
well I'll give you a couple examples uh

217
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,458
one is that if you're of my generation

218
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,520
uh and we'll my kids just had a 80s

219
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,860
holiday or an 80s dress-up day and so

220
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,080
we'll stick with that theme uh maybe you

221
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,519
wanted to go to the mall and be

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,760
excellent to each other and the if you

223
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
were going to do that you had to call on

224
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,180
your phone hope your friends were there

225
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,060
on their phone at their landline

226
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,459
um a range of time and place to meet at

227
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,959
the mall and go there and if you changed

228
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,720
anything in the interim well you're out

229
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
of luck you just could not move on the

230
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,860
Fly you would you would either have to

231
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,279
go there and get your friends together

232
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,740
and say actually let's go see a movie

233
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,560
instead of hang out at the mall and then

234
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,899
you could re revector well because of

235
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,459
cell phones which are not cyber security

236
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,980
per se but they do lubricate the process

237
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,540
of information they strengthen

238
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,820
information power most people today

239
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,860
don't even bother coordinating when and

240
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,800
where they're going to meet outside of a

241
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
broad uh we'll meet around this time and

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
go to this place and they do that

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,040
coordination on the Fly which is so much

244
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
more efficient because if something

245
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,160
changes if someone comes you want to do

246
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
something different you want to meet

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,000
somewhere else you end up you can change

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
that on the Fly you don't have to spend

249
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,720
all the time of going meeting up making

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,700
a decision going elsewhere meeting up

251
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,740
making a decision and that's actually

252
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,560
reflects itself replicates itself with

253
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,220
oil tankers before radio oil tankers

254
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,380
would leave where they were going uh

255
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,420
from and go to where they were going to

256
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,519
the people who are going to buy oil

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,000
and if the price was not good at the

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,459
place they were going to well tough you

259
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,160
would show up and you'd sell your oil uh

260
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
now not only do we have radios which can

261
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,940
communicate with tankers which that

262
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,620
started fairly early on but we now have

263
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,800
computers that can figure out where the

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,540
various prices are and how far the

265
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,760
tankers are from their location on the

266
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,380
globe and whether it's worth it to

267
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,120
re-vector them to another Market or not

268
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,339
and this is made the oil Market much

269
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,380
more efficient it makes it such that the

270
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,600
prices propagate out relatively quickly

271
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,339
across the market and when prices drop

272
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,380
that's great when prices rise not as

273
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,720
great although realistically when the

274
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,339
market is inefficient what that made for

275
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,380
was expensive more expensive oil than it

276
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,760
needed to be

277
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
what this means or when we start

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,060
thinking about information as

279
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,339
information power this means that the

280
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,079
government is not the biggest player and

281
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,079
in fact there are much many many large

282
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,459
players that are going to have larger

283
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,200
impacts on the information environment

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
uh than you uh than anything the

285
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
government could possibly do and I've

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,700
picked four fairly large companies here

287
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,019
that you will have all recognized

288
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,620
because of their logo but it's there are

289
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,540
lots of small companies there's lots of

290
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,399
just individual groups that are going to

291
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,500
have more effect than most government

292
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,860
operations on on on a daily basis and in

293
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,779
the aggregate things outside the

294
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,459
government are much more important to

295
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,640
information power than anywhere else

296
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,380
um and this is important when you think

297
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,420
about people talking about the relative

298
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,899
power of the United States or its allies

299
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,620
uh and or its competitors

300
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,380
what is not happening in the government

301
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,820
that

302
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,459
is happening elsewhere and often it's

303
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,540
things that are outside the government

304
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,339
that are more important to put a very

305
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,019
fine point on it within the last month

306
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,060
I've had several conversations where

307
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,760
people have claimed the U.S is not doing

308
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,600
this and I have said no the U.S is doing

309
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,959
it it is happening at Purdue

310
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,360
and I have no specific programs that are

311
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
occurring at Purdue University that are

312
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,339
forwarding information and moving the

313
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,140
way that we process information forward

314
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,180
and universities are a big part of this

315
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,300
uh just just generally

316
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
another important issue is the

317
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,640
information is something that is vital

318
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,700
to free markets in fact free markets are

319
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,800
information price carries information

320
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,500
and importantly having free information

321
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,440
allows markets to thrive

322
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,240
um it's another talk altogether one

323
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,279
which I do give but the role that

324
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,500
markets play in Innovation and the role

325
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,959
that Innovation plays in economic growth

326
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,019
is almost impossible to overstate if you

327
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,139
go back to starting in 1950 when we

328
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,420
start seeing things like the development

329
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,120
of the transistor

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,740
and integrated chips and so on

331
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,260
information

332
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,779
Innovations have led to propagation of

333
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,060
information and Innovative growth across

334
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,940
the market and accounts for enormous

335
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,100
almost incalculable amounts of economic

336
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,779
growth that we would not have expected

337
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,459
otherwise

338
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,380
um

339
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,139
but it's important to think of what

340
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,660
makes up the information space so I'm

341
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,160
talking to a group people are interested

342
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,079
in information security and of course

343
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,360
information security touches everything

344
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,839
but it also has different it being about

345
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,019
information it has different groups that

346
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,360
it is associated with in a in a

347
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,899
qualitatively different way uh and that

348
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,660
in that information space Not only is

349
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,019
the relationship the the support that uh

350
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,240
cyber security provides to something

351
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,300
like uh say an oil company to stick with

352
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,360
the oil theme but also there is a shared

353
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,120
Mission a shared sense of

354
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,420
uh of a a shared way of doing things

355
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,899
because information is core and Central

356
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,760
to the mission of these other groups and

357
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,180
so think about education education is

358
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,920
teaching people how to onboard

359
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,639
information uh and cyber security does

360
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,980
that as well and in fact a lot of us

361
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,440
cyber security effort is educating other

362
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,019
people unsurprising because this is all

363
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,959
within the information space

364
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,940
journalism again a lot of the reports

365
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,200
that you might read from cyber security

366
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,420
look like journalism journalism is

367
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,480
processing uh information that's

368
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,040
occurring in the moment and they're

369
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,600
trying to get things out as fast as

370
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,660
possible and the same is true with cyber

371
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,500
security uh the entertainment in gaming

372
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,839
it is amazing to me to see how much

373
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,600
overlap there is between gaming cyber

374
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,339
security and information and I will just

375
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,959
leave it at that

376
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,620
um

377
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,019
but gaming is one of the largest

378
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,120
portions in the information economy

379
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,199
today uh I have the value of gaming

380
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,360
companies and and the gaming assets of

381
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,980
major information companies of which

382
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,560
almost every information company you

383
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
would think of has a gaming division

384
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,480
today uh is is tremendous and outstrips

385
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,260
a lot of other forms of entertainment

386
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,480
but most importantly cyber security

387
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,839
cyber security is what allows this

388
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,440
information space to exist it allows

389
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,380
everything

390
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,360
to take place so to give you a few

391
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,860
examples

392
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,459
um in the market space cyber security uh

393
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,980
when if we think about the three the CIA

394
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,139
model of cyber security

395
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,079
um the the confidentiality the integrity

396
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
and the access that cyber security

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
should provide for

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,660
um

399
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,480
companies as they are pursuing their

400
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,940
economic best interests uh relies very

401
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,040
heavily on cyber security so for example

402
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,899
if you have

403
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,199
um uh proprietary information uh uh

404
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,079
intellectual property IP and you spend a

405
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,000
lot of money on that IP you don't want

406
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,740
that leaking out and one of the major

407
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,600
ways in which that leaks out is cyber

408
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
security uh cyber security violations

409
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
hackers will get in and steal things now

410
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,660
of course it's not the only way and it's

411
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,839
not a new problem uh but it is a new way

412
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,639
that cyber security is supposed to deal

413
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,120
with similarly information decays or

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,920
degrading information or preventing

415
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,540
people from getting it this is all

416
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,399
something that is in the cyber security

417
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,639
realm and it is noteworthy that in

418
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,860
governments uh the groups that take care

419
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,019
of cyber security defense and cyber

420
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,779
security offense are not usually as

421
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,000
separate as you might think in part

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,940
because protecting protecting these

423
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,279
things that are important uh for say the

424
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,699
economy or for uh Social Development or

425
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,440
any of these other things

426
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,220
um

427
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,339
is not it's very closely associated and

428
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,259
of course uh you guys know that better

429
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,160
than uh anyone else so why should you

430
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,459
care that information is a portion of

431
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,220
National Power why should it matter well

432
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,640
on one level it's because people when

433
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,079
they say oh we need to have cyber

434
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,619
security because it goes uh to the

435
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,959
economy or because it protects our

436
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,540
military operations well that's true and

437
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,459
it's a good thing that people are

438
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,160
thinking about that but it is also a

439
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,380
source of power in the information realm

440
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,960
unto itself but again why should you

441
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,220
care whether it's a source of National

442
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
Power well

443
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,360
International competition and and to be

444
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,559
honest you guys should have seen this

445
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,020
coming I worked for the air force uh and

446
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,760
you know International competition is

447
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,799
something that we we talk about a lot

448
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,020
and it's something that you have seen in

449
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,419
the news a lot most likely

450
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,820
um an important thing that people who

451
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,919
don't work in foreign policy or have a

452
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,179
background in international relations

453
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,460
may not fully understand but it's

454
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,140
actually not that is not that

455
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,200
controversial is the role in which uh

456
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,360
the strength of a country of the

457
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,860
government and the country from which

458
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,340
you are in reflects a lot of the

459
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,200
interest that you have even if you don't

460
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
like your government even if you don't

461
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,059
uh like certain policies you're almost

462
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,520
always better off being in a strong

463
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,240
country uh having strong being in a

464
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
strong country that country is able to

465
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,919
protect the interests of its citizens uh

466
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,200
or subjects on the international stage

467
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,900
it's able to pursue the interests of its

468
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,280
citizens or subjects on the

469
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
international stage there's a reason why

470
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,780
AI a lot of the preferences of Apple and

471
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,340
Google and Microsoft are written into

472
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,620
International treaty and the preferences

473
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,780
of uh whatever company in Egypt or

474
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,500
um

475
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,140
Zimbabwe will pick on poor Zimbabwe uh

476
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,480
are not it's because the United States

477
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,240
is a very powerful country and a big

478
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,640
portion of that is information power and

479
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,240
so when you are out there working on

480
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,700
power change changing and affecting

481
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
information power uh you're actually

482
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,480
affecting international relations per se

483
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,120
and so well great you might say is this

484
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
so we've got people who are out there

485
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,720
using cyber security to make us rich and

486
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,900
powerful and grow the economy what not

487
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,160
so is that just the way that everybody

488
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,039
is doing things well no

489
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,780
and I don't know if it's fortunate or

490
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,360
unfortunate but it is real

491
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
um the way that the role that

492
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
information plays in National strategy

493
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,260
government policy is a result of

494
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,780
government choices uh the choices that

495
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,700
they make about what they're going to

496
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,179
use the information to optimize for so

497
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,679
remember that information can increase

498
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,200
efficiency but it can't increase

499
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,299
efficiency universally it would be nice

500
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,400
if it could but it can't uh and it's

501
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,220
because of policy choices so let's

502
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,140
imagine that you have a government that

503
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,000
chooses or even in a circumstance that

504
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,640
it's going to try to

505
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,260
optimize for the military or

506
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,200
instrumental power what that why that is

507
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
attractive is that when you are

508
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,080
optimizing for military power

509
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,660
instrumental power internationally and

510
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,059
domestically you get to use power in the

511
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,299
way that you like and hopefully you are

512
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,280
making good strategic choices that allow

513
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,820
you to out maneuver your your adversary

514
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,980
your competitors and I think that you've

515
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,960
probably heard people talk about this

516
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,020
we're getting out maneuvered in

517
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,140
cyberspace well it could be because

518
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,840
people are optimizing for military or

519
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
instrumental power however the problem

520
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,220
with uh optimizing for military or

521
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,720
instrumental power is that it is

522
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,520
inherently hostile to free information

523
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,059
and therefore hostile to markets which

524
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,340
also makes it favor weak information

525
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,620
security and I'll tell you why this is

526
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,679
real quickly so if you think about an

527
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,780
organization that is trying to control

528
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,940
information so that it can operate

529
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,100
in as it chooses it's got a lot of

530
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
incentives to do that it doesn't want

531
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,660
its secrets to leak out but it does want

532
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,539
to know what everyone else is doing and

533
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,299
so the if you are already opting into a

534
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,799
system where you're trying to when

535
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,419
you're where your organization is

536
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,600
choosing to make the Strategic decisions

537
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,380
as internally as possible well a lot of

538
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,179
the the control of information security

539
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,640
writ large and by the way when I say

540
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,740
weak information security I mean general

541
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,780
not theirs they want to lock their

542
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,820
information security down

543
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,539
um

544
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,039
writ large is not very appealing you

545
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,280
want you want your competitors

546
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,900
domestically and overseas to have as

547
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,120
weak information security as possible

548
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,059
however if you rely on economics if you

549
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,580
optimize for economic growth well you're

550
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,799
relying you're betting the farm so to

551
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,860
speak that your economy will grow faster

552
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,740
than others can outmaneuver you

553
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,140
and this is fundamentally the argument

554
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,659
that you see in liberalism going back to

555
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,539
uh you know the 17th 18th centuries Adam

556
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,880
Smith and John Locke and what have you

557
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,840
um this makes if uh governments that

558
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,360
optimize for economics well they have to

559
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,980
be friendly for free markets that's how

560
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,140
they're doing it and therefore they need

561
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,260
free information markets make and use

562
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,120
information if you're going to have

563
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,260
markets you've got to have free

564
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,799
information and therefore it is in their

565
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,780
best interest to have strong information

566
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,860
security generally because the uh the

567
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,840
needs of the public to have information

568
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,659
security be able to control their own uh

569
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,179
confidential information but still gain

570
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,700
access to what they should you know what

571
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,059
should be public well that is uh very

572
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,200
attractive to a uh to a government that

573
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,500
chooses to optimize on economics

574
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,620
um what this in simpler terms perhaps is

575
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,740
is if you want to use power to do

576
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,419
something you want to control

577
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,299
information and have maximum insight

578
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,360
into what everybody else is doing but by

579
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
controlling that information you're

580
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,600
going to sacrifice economic growth

581
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,179
however if you want to control the Akai

582
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,100
if you want to grow your economy you've

583
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,840
got to open up information Freedom as

584
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,520
possible as much as possible while

585
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,440
simultaneously protecting privileged

586
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,539
information

587
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,940
but by so doing you're allowing a lot of

588
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,460
tumult a lot of conflict to occur and

589
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,120
and probably oh probably not going to be

590
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
able to use power as strategically as

591
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,280
someone who's controlling information

592
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,559
and you don't even have to think of this

593
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,200
as a national government policy you will

594
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,440
see this play out in countries uh in

595
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,240
Democratic countries which generally

596
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,299
optimize for economic growth but when

597
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,100
they decide that they need to do

598
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,100
something they lock information down and

599
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
they or people will argue for

600
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,419
controlling information as much as

601
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,640
possible because in order to make things

602
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,820
happen in order to keep secrets in order

603
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,960
to

604
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,559
um

605
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,799
control uh exercise control over battle

606
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
space you've got to control the

607
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,059
information because information is power

608
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,280
power unto itself

609
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
um and so this is where you come in and

610
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,320
this is the famous Kirchner poster and

611
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
this is not me recruiting you into

612
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,799
military because I just said the

613
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,659
military is only a small part of the

614
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,580
government is only a small part

615
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,460
um but we're really really early in this

616
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
process and there are a lot of things

617
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,240
that we have not thought all the way

618
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
through

619
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,140
and

620
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,820
unfortunately the overlap between people

621
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,620
who understand International politics

622
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,520
and cyber security is very narrow and

623
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,700
there are many times when cyber security

624
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,020
idiosyncrasies will matter for foreign

625
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,320
policy and especially should matter for

626
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,539
foreign policy because we again are

627
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,820
thinking about how this affects

628
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,880
information power and just to give you a

629
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,100
very specific example

630
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,039
um when we have zero day problems

631
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,700
um

632
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,179
things that that come out that imposes a

633
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,340
cost on the economy but it also imposes

634
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,320
a cost on our ability to process

635
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
information because it forces us to

636
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,700
shuffle all kinds of things people are

637
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,240
repositioning uh economic uh assets as

638
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,520
they uh deal with cyber security

639
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,279
challenges people are reassessing the

640
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,320
risks that they're willing to take

641
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,440
um and it interacts with the World At

642
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,200
Large so you have problems that arise in

643
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,720
foreign policy that can cause and as we

644
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,419
have seen precipitated out cyber

645
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,720
security problems as with Russia and

646
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,120
Ukraine several times now

647
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,220
um so there's this massive interaction

648
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,440
of foreign policy and power

649
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,779
um but it's not completely well thought

650
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,020
through because we just haven't had time

651
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,200
and I recognize that if you talk about

652
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,620
on the scale of cyber security uh it

653
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,480
will sound like oh man The Internet's

654
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,580
been around for you know in its current

655
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,740
form at least 20 years you know in in

656
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,779
any form at all maybe 40 or 50. you know

657
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,159
it's a very well developed technology

658
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,220
and while that is true on the scale of

659
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,520
international politics it isn't

660
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,640
um we just don't have enough

661
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,500
um time to think about or we have not

662
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,120
had enough time to think and collect

663
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,640
information and so there is a lot of

664
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,880
room for people to make a real uh

665
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,940
intervention here by thinking deeply uh

666
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,700
and considering what is going on and

667
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,460
what that implies in this case is

668
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,260
thinking about the interactions between

669
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,419
the information space and the other

670
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,679
spaces

671
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,559
so when the time comes and it will come

672
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,600
in some country where there is some kind

673
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,700
of national security threat that people

674
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,000
think is really a big deal uh think of

675
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,700
second 911 or the invasion of Ukraine

676
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,220
and the question will come should we

677
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,260
turn off the internet or should we do

678
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,539
some other take some other decisive

679
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,940
action that we think will improve our

680
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,659
security our ability to use information

681
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,760
our ability to use power instrumentally

682
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,700
well in order to make that consideration

683
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,020
very uh reasonable people have have to

684
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,700
have some place to start to think about

685
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
the other instruments of power

686
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,640
um

687
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,039
and because we do that we think about

688
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,779
what it will cost us when we impose

689
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,640
economic sanctions to achieve military

690
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,860
outcomes we think about what it will

691
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,860
hurt uh if we think about uh if we do

692
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,419
something that is offensive to other

693
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,700
countries uh and therefore causes us to

694
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,760
lose allies we need to put information

695
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,740
at the that same pedestal we need to

696
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,440
think about the damage that or the

697
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,120
advantages that using each of these

698
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
other instruments of power can inflict

699
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,860
on information and how using information

700
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,779
is

701
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,640
um it can help those other instruments

702
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,340
of Power by using it strategically uh

703
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,679
and I wish that I had good news that

704
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,419
there's just tens of thousands of people

705
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,919
who are thinking about this and in some

706
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,679
ways there are there absolutely are but

707
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,820
the field is so open that it's there I

708
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,400
will say frequently I could assign a

709
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
master's thesis to every single student

710
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,419
for my entire career and never duplicate

711
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,179
topics there's just so much uh so much

712
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,400
research to be done and if you think you

713
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,559
want to to do this well give me a call

714
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,380
let's let's talk about it these are my

715
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,640
emails

716
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,559
um

717
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,419
the uh the best one to get me is

718
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,580
probably the dot edu email the

719
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,340
protonmail is at the bottom uh and I'm

720
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,919
uh I tried to and I succeeded at leaving

721
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,659
some time for some questions and answers

722
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,539
a little extra time for some q a uh

723
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,340
because I know that this is a field

724
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,640
outside what Sirius May normally cover

725
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,100
um but that said it uh what are your

726
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,919
questions and how can I and what I can

727
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,520
answer for you

728
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,820
foreign

729
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,779
I don't see any questions

730
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,179
um attendees yeah if you could uh if you

731
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,460
oh there's one that came in here

732
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,760
um let's see how do you think about the

733
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,580
people Republic of China's lockdown of

734
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
information compared with their

735
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,659
impressive economic growth

736
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,220
so there's a lot of ways that I can

737
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,840
answer this question and I'm going to

738
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
cheat just a little bit and tell you

739
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,679
that my first job in the U.S army was as

740
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,440
a Chinese linguist so uh when I focus on

741
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,679
geography I focus on China a lot I spent

742
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,659
a lot of time thinking about this and

743
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,700
people will often bring this up and it's

744
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
perfectly reasonable to talk about China

745
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,899
because China has experienced enormous

746
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:07,500
economic growth however

747
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,140
um China's

748
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,820
China's economic the first answer to

749
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,679
that is China's economic growth is not

750
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,960
as impressive as you might think now it

751
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,020
is enormous unto itself but China's per

752
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,179
capita GDP is about the global average

753
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,960
so what that means is that China has it

754
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,539
has definitely come a long way in its

755
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,340
development but a lot of the size of

756
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,899
their economy is because they have so

757
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,940
many people and once you have that many

758
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,080
people

759
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,659
um making any you know any a single

760
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,740
dollar a year in GDP uh Improvement uh

761
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,840
it really moves things forward there's

762
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,720
uh so what some of what you're seeing is

763
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,460
the fact that you may have heard the

764
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,140
Chinese discuss the century of

765
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,640
humiliation

766
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,279
and it depends on who's talking when

767
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,320
they think that Century ended

768
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,760
um but basically from about

769
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,240
1840s to about

770
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,100
1979. there were there was just

771
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,960
basically constant catastrophes

772
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,220
befalling China uh and so uh just

773
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,140
stopping that from happening was a lot

774
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,240
of economic growth so that was that

775
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,100
that's a bit of a cheat but I'm going to

776
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,760
move a little bit more in this direction

777
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,380
with that

778
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,899
um what China has done is they have led

779
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:31,140
the way in trying to thread the needle

780
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,600
so what my dissertation was about and

781
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,059
what I have researched uh what got me

782
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,980
into this was the use of information for

783
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,539
social control

784
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,600
um so the if you're going to try to use

785
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,700
social control one of the things that

786
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,480
you can do is uh get as much granular

787
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,659
information as you possibly can and

788
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,820
China has done that so if you look at

789
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,760
the way that they um that they opened up

790
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,260
to the Internet which they did

791
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,059
relatively late

792
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,520
um the the internet first started taking

793
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,220
uh hold around 2000 there were there

794
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,220
were sites before then but the um

795
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,039
they at first opened up pretty much

796
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,740
unrestricted but when I say unrestricted

797
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,020
it was only the Fairly wealthy who could

798
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,760
get the internet uh and people who are

799
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
connected and then almost immediately

800
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,539
they began a process of censorship and

801
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:27,600
so the censorship regime uh is intended

802
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,779
to choose what is not economically

803
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,080
useful and allow and block that if it's

804
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
politically threatening uh and allow

805
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
what is economically useful through uh

806
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,100
and so their lockdown regime is uh it's

807
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,039
it's trying to thread the needle uh and

808
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,500
to a certain extent they have succeeded

809
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,520
however uh since Xi Jinping has become

810
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,000
uh the the chairman of the Communist

811
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,799
Party in China there has been a

812
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,840
qualitative shift in the way that China

813
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,020
handles its um cyber security and its

814
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,539
information openness I saw it when I was

815
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,299
visiting China it is very noticeable

816
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,539
um the there is

817
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,320
I I would not expect to see the same

818
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,659
level of economic growth in China going

819
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,000
forward as this information policy

820
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
changes

821
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,720
um and the leadership of the party are

822
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,340
signaling that they don't expect it

823
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,279
either uh with uh proclamations about

824
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,140
how um

825
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,720
uh how there's going to be 10 years of

826
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,299
economic stagnation and and things like

827
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,159
this through their mouthpieces that are

828
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,200
out in society

829
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,899
um it is you know I am open to the idea

830
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,820
that you know I'm just wrong

831
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,740
um but you know because that's always a

832
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,659
possibility I could always be wrong

833
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,360
um but once you start looking fairly

834
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
closely at each of these cases you can

835
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,179
see that actually information flows the

836
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,399
more that it flows even in China the

837
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,840
better off their economy is the more

838
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
they restrict it the harder it is to get

839
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,179
things done

840
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,199
great uh yeah we have another question

841
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,099
here

842
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,619
um what are your thoughts on U.S

843
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,139
cybercom drawing on some of the more

844
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,000
traditional information operations

845
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,859
psyops folks

846
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,139
into their planning process and

847
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,119
operation cycle combining those

848
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,099
instruments of power on the national

849
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,619
strategic level

850
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,300
so there's

851
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,359
um

852
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,280
uh I'll add a disclaimer two disclaimers

853
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,560
here that I know a lot of these guys uh

854
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,239
but that I don't know any secrets so

855
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,820
what I'm saying here is is just uh based

856
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,918
on you know the people that I know uh

857
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,560
and the familiar conversations that

858
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,820
we've had

859
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,040
um but the so

860
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,139
my sense is that a lot of what we're

861
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,980
seeing is is a function of uh the fact

862
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,839
that we're just really early in the

863
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,220
process

864
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,339
um it's we're we're sort of at the point

865
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,859
where uh Socrates and Plato were

866
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,960
thinking about politics in general three

867
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,520
thousand or two thousand five hundred

868
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,839
years ago

869
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,560
um

870
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
you know there's we don't have this uh

871
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,140
real enormous reservoir of ideas to draw

872
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,660
upon and so naturally people look around

873
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,700
and say well how is this like that and

874
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,560
and we're seeing a fair amount of that

875
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
and so people are are thinking about uh

876
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,520
psyops and uh and uh information Intel

877
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,200
uh Intel uh as as a starting point now

878
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,020
that said there is a risk uh implied in

879
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,240
what I was saying which is if you mix

880
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,040
the two different

881
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,260
um instruments of power inappropriately

882
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,920
you can really run into problems because

883
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,740
the objectives or the strengths of those

884
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,079
instruments of Power are

885
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,540
um really challenging and where we can

886
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,339
see where we can imagine this happening

887
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:59,460
is sort of the traditional uh warning uh

888
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,800
for democratic governments you keep

889
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,220
standing militaries out of politics uh

890
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,400
and that's what they're really saying is

891
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,500
that you we we need you to not mix the

892
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,380
instruments of power here the structure

893
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,240
of a military is antithetical to the

894
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,640
operation of democratic governments to

895
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,619
the extent that people take that

896
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,500
consideration into heart to heart and

897
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
the folks that I know really do

898
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,760
um

899
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,099
I think that it's it's a reasonable

900
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,839
starting point

901
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,119
um but I think that it is also important

902
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,000
to very carefully weigh the role that

903
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,579
information plays in Democratic Society

904
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,740
and the relationship that the military

905
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,440
has to that Democratic Society because

906
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,960
if you start overstepping those bounds

907
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,700
in information or if you start

908
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,579
overstepping it in economics essentially

909
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,579
the uh the the warning that uh

910
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,320
Eisenhower made in his second inaugural

911
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,839
are in second inaugural address against

912
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,880
the military-industrial complex was

913
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,560
about the military playing too large of

914
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,839
a role in the economic uh instrument of

915
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,320
power uh you can get crosswise and it

916
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,180
can be it can be a political challenge

917
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,560
uh to overcome

918
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,900
[Music]

919
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,280
I can see that question I'll just go

920
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,599
ahead and read it yeah how does

921
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,220
misinformation play into cyber security

922
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,260
so there's there's two ways in which

923
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,079
misinformation plays into cyber security

924
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,599
um one is that if you can get access to

925
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,300
good information like legit information

926
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
it can help you craft better

927
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,260
misinformation uh so for example if you

928
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,359
have access to actual conversations

929
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,160
between uh uh foreign powers leaders in

930
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,720
foreign powers and you know what they're

931
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,640
actually talking about when you go to

932
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,740
craft your misinformation the things

933
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,540
that they have held secret that people

934
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,000
will that people who know will take to

935
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
be legitimate

936
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,880
um they they will uh that it's it's

937
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,619
um it's difficult to fake those secret

938
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,480
conversations and those secret concerns

939
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,020
so imagine uh that to the president of

940
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,040
the United States and the Prime Minister

941
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,280
of Great Britain were having talks about

942
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,619
um well how about natural gas shipments

943
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,060
and they're very concerned about natural

944
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,579
gas and that a foreign power of some

945
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,500
kind were to come along and say well we

946
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,839
want to influence this now outside of

947
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,820
this outside of this particular context

948
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,960
it would be fairly obvious everybody

949
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,160
like of course they're thinking about

950
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,079
natural gas but say five years ago

951
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,400
nobody knows that they're thinking about

952
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,099
natural gas as a primary issue and it's

953
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,240
only happening in back Channel

954
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,280
Communications well then when you go to

955
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
make your misinformation you can you can

956
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,240
put that truth in there and it it gives

957
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,040
it verisimilitude

958
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,140
um another thing is is that if you've

959
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,240
had a cyber security breach it makes

960
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,200
misinformation much more credible so I

961
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,180
was actually surprised that for the most

962
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,060
part at least as far as the campaigns uh

963
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,420
acknowledged that um the the stuff that

964
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,940
was released

965
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,640
from the John podesta emails was mostly

966
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,099
legitimate at least as far as as far as

967
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,320
they have said so it's not like they

968
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,339
released 90 uh 90 were actual emails

969
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,020
that he sent and 10 were things that

970
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,260
that somebody had made up but no knowing

971
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,420
that there had been the breach it was

972
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,940
very plausible that these things that

973
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,619
you could have done that you could have

974
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,260
you could have put out like hey here's

975
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,940
this email that we found and in fact

976
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,119
when you have a credible breaches of any

977
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,460
kind uh it raises the potential for

978
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,099
misinformation or it may raises the the

979
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,859
purchase that misinformation might have

980
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,260
um I will add this however the best

981
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,820
misinformation or the best

982
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,380
disinformation is real uh if you there

983
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,180
there are things that

984
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,400
um the the closest that we can we've

985
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,560
ever come to having information alone

986
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,020
causing a war is probably the Zimmerman

987
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,480
Telegram there were other things at

988
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,000
stake there uh that was real

989
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,060
uh and and I don't I don't know that uh

990
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,859
misinformation campaign by the British

991
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,500
uh would have have worked in the same

992
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,640
way

993
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,200
um the next closest for misinformation

994
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,780
was probably the Spanish-American War

995
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,380
um but the main did blow up and so you

996
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,619
know so the the the the the the cases uh

997
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,839
to say that it wasn't the Spanish I mean

998
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,240
it was it turns out it wasn't as uh

999
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,700
based on the latest science

1000
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,359
um

1001
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,119
but it it's you know plausibility and

1002
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,700
and real information that's that's very

1003
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,700
effective uh missing and very effective

1004
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,980
in in a in a public and a free

1005
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,960
information environment

1006
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,680
foreign

1007
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,740
suggestions on places to go for research

1008
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,359
questions that need answered that can

1009
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,280
help impact U.S government policy as it

1010
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,160
relates to cyber so in general uh

1011
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,079
there's two ways to find research

1012
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,640
questions one is through the literature

1013
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,440
and two is through the world so

1014
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
literature as you go and you read what

1015
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,480
people are writing about uh and and say

1016
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,339
well here's a question that hasn't been

1017
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,099
answered right so we figured out these

1018
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,020
seven points about

1019
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,460
um encryption we need to know this

1020
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,619
eighth I'm going to answer the eighth

1021
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,780
perfectly legitimate way to go for the

1022
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,980
most part I think that you're going to

1023
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,540
have more success affecting policy

1024
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,700
looking at the world what things do we

1025
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,820
see in the world that don't make sense

1026
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,700
otherwise right and so the um and just

1027
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,220
from a pragmatic perspective I would try

1028
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,160
to combine whatever your your actual

1029
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,680
strengths are uh your natural advantages

1030
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,880
with

1031
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,540
um

1032
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,460
with what you look at and that's going

1033
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,680
to happen in some ways naturally but if

1034
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,800
you're a coder and you uh and you're

1035
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,660
really good at you know say doing

1036
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,920
um

1037
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,820
big big data type analysis well then

1038
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,560
find something you know but you're also

1039
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,180
pretty informed on policy well the

1040
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,859
intersection between big data and policy

1041
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,960
starts looking pretty good you're uh and

1042
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,339
there's going to be 100 questions there

1043
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,440
and so just with your knowledge of what

1044
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,619
policy is you could ask a variety of

1045
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,420
questions and sometimes and another way

1046
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,300
another great place is in the recent

1047
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,119
past so for example

1048
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,339
um five years ago people were just

1049
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,400
absolutely banana pants about uh net

1050
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,160
neutrality it got reversed

1051
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,440
did anything change

1052
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,560
uh I don't know like you know there may

1053
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,420
be a there may be a study out there but

1054
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,220
looking at well something changed did we

1055
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,380
see other things change what about uh

1056
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,599
you know cyber attacks uh originating

1057
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,339
from Russia in the context of the uh

1058
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,980
Ukraine war are they different now than

1059
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,859
they were five years ago why

1060
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,780
those are sort of like looking at the

1061
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,700
world and and finding questions and they

1062
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,040
would definitely affect policy

1063
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,220
okay it looks like we don't have any

1064
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,440
more questions but uh David thank you so
