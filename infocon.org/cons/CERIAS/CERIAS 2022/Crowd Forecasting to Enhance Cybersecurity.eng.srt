1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,360
um and so let me start by welcoming

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440
everyone who's tuned in

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,360
to another one of our wednesday seminars

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,559
uh it is with great pleasure that uh i

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,639
introduce our speaker

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,679
paul

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
is um

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,039
somebody i've known for several years

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,359
and and through several different

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
uh kinds of engagements

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,320
um he's notable in the area of policy

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
he's worked as a deputy assistant

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
secretary at the department of homeland

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
security

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
and for those of you who aren't familiar

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,719
with that i'm not going to go through

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,480
how a deputy assistant is different than

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,000
a deputy is different than an assistant

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,760
but it's an important position on the

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
list

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,680
um

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,559
and

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,920
he uh has been a lecturer at uh the

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
george washington university

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
um he's been uh involved in advising to

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
a number of different groups he's part

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,000
of the chertoff group he's worked as a

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
consultant there he advises the aba he's

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,400
been on a number of government task

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
force

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
and basically the point to take away

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
from this is this is somebody who's been

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
involved in policy

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,119
for a long time

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,000
at a very serious level has some great

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
thoughts on the issue and he's going to

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
share some of them with us today about a

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
really unique initiative that he helped

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,920
start

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
and so without further ado although

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,479
there is one thing i will mention

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,720
uh i'm going to introduce paul but if

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
you have a question for paul based on

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,680
his uh presentation please enter it in

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
well thank you thank you so much for

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,640
having me i'm delighted to be here and

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
let me share up my screen and get us

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
started with this it really is a

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,040
pleasure to to to talk with you um just

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
so that everybody who's listening knows

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
i want to be a hundred percent clear i

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
am not a computer scientist

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,119
i speak computer a little but my

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,879
life's work has been translating

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,160
the the work that technologists do into

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
the language of law and policy sometimes

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
successfully sometimes not

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
just as an aside i got that job because

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
back in 1976 i took my first computer

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
programming class uh in high school i

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
learned a language called pl1 which is

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
no longer in existence as far as i can

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,440
tell um and so when they started looking

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,519
for people to do policy work on cyber

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
security issues in the early 2000s there

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
was only one kid in the room me who

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,120
actually had ever put fingers on a

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
computer and also had a law degree so

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,319
you never know where you're going to

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
wind up okay i you never can tell what

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
it's going to be like

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
so my topic today

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
is uh as as spaff said something uh new

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
a relatively new idea that we that i

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,480
have

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
that i've been working on for the last

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
six or eight months

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
about how to use crowd forecasting tools

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
to enhance cyber security now let me see

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
if i've managed to figure out

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,239
how to

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,120
uh

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
advance that the uh

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
the uh

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
the uh there we go

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,040
and now i should be able to

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
advance it yes there we go so

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
here's my value proposition about crowd

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,519
forecasting and i'm going to use a a

94
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,480
non-cyber model

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,280
uh for for the moment

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
let's say that you were a senior

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
official in the united states government

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
and you asked your staff the question

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
yeah will russian troops be out of

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,200
ukraine by the end of 2020

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
two

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
it would be i think really cool

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
if we knew the answer to that question

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
uh it would be extremely useful to

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
policymakers in the united states and

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
europe and probably everywhere around

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
the globe if we had a good sense of that

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
now i can tell you my opinion

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
if you want

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
and it's valueless because i know

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,279
nothing about russia and the ukraine um

112
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
if you were the american president you

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
could go and consult a whole bunch of

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
experts who work inside the government

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,280
who've been studying russia um for years

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
at the cia in the nsa and the department

117
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,720
of defense and get their answer

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
or

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,479
you could ask the world

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,600
you could ask the crowds

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
the idea behind crowd force casting is

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
that we can accumulate the wisdom of the

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
crowds and imagine if you got an answer

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
from them

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
yeah imagine if after asking this

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,400
question in the world you got a strong

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
yes everybody was confident that russian

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
troops would be out of the ukraine by

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
the end of 22. well then your plans

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
would

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
be changed from the current defensive

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
ideas to yeah how are we going to

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,919
rebuild ukraine what are we going to do

134
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,000
to integrate it into the european union

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
those sorts of forward-looking things

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
for the next phase beyond the end of the

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,919
war

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,080
if it was a soft yes yes but we're not

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,199
so sure

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
then you do some cautious rearmament you

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
plan on how to rebuild the ukrainian

142
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
military but maybe you wouldn't go

143
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
full bore on integration into the

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
european union

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
likewise a a soft note we think it's not

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
going to happen um

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,759
would be

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,440
uh yeah okay we need to really think

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
about what ukraine's long-term defensive

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
plans are what military equipment they

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
need for that if it were a strong note

152
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
for sure no the war is still going to be

153
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,560
going on they're going to be fighting uh

154
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
like the dickens as bad as it is now if

155
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
not worse then your real work would be

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
planning for refugees an economic crisis

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
there'd be no wheat next year so knowing

158
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
the answer to this question in advance

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
would be

160
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
uh a pretty good thing or

161
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
if you had confidence in a prediction

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
knowing the answer is a little strong if

163
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
you had confidence in a prediction that

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
would be a pretty cool thing

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
so what does that mean for cyber

166
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
security

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
let me give you a little context for

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
this

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
for the last

170
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
five years

171
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
the main focus of the research i've been

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
doing

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
is on the development of metrics for

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,759
cyber security generally speaking

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
right now i think it's fair to say

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
that cyber security is as much if not

177
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,120
more of an art

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,039
than it is a science

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
you know we all know

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
that two-factor authentication

181
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
is better than not having it

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,160
but if i ask you to quantify how much

183
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
better and what the value proposition of

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,680
it was in dollar terms or in efficiency

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
terms or in a tax prevented

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
you'd have a hard time coming up with a

187
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
hard number and that's actually an easy

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
case

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
we have a really difficult time uh

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
assessing the value of security

191
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
implementations in enterprise management

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,759
systems uh that of great complexity and

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
that lack of metrics

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,800
is

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
in in my broad context or one of the

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
reasons why

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,680
i feel as though we under invest in

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
cyber security it's not because we're

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
ignorant of the fact that it's a problem

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
it's because we haven't gotten to a

201
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
point um where we are able to express

202
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
the value of a cyber security

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
instantiation in a way that people in a

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
corporate boardroom or the national

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
security council the us government can

206
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
actually put wrap their minds around so

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
i've written a lot of papers about how

208
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,879
to do this better um and and there are

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
some people who think you can't do it

210
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,199
because it's always um yo and it's an

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
infinitely vulnerable space with an

212
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,120
infinite number of attackers with an

213
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
infinite number of attack vectors and so

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
we can't measure a reduction in the

215
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,199
infinite i i think that's too grim

216
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
prediction markets or crowd forecasting

217
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,599
is the idea that we might be able to

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,720
harness

219
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,960
crowdsourced information

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
as one tool

221
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,759
in giving us a better sense of how to

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
improve or how not to improve

223
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,240
cyber security activities going forward

224
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
so this is part of a broader idea that

225
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,640
i'm working on that i spend most of my

226
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
time on which is can we figure out a way

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
to actually bring home the reality of

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
cyber security to policy makers

229
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
lawmakers in a way that actually uh uh

230
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
makes sense to them on a kind of bottom

231
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
line uh personal economics

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
basis um i should say right now and i

233
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
want to be clear that i've done a lot of

234
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
this all of this work really in

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
collaboration with a wonderful colleague

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,120
at uh at the r street institute mary

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
brooks she and i are presenting this

238
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
together at rsa i was actually supposed

239
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
to present this after our rsa

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
presentation in february

241
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,680
but

242
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
as you know uh our the rsa conference in

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
san francisco was postponed to june so

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
you guys are actually getting it a

245
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
little ahead rather than a little behind

246
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
um so here's my agenda for this

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
discussion um

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
i want to tell you a little bit more

249
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
about what cloud forecasting is what i

250
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,640
mean by it i want to tell you how it can

251
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,680
be used in cyber security i want to tell

252
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
you how we can build a crowd forecasting

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
platform uh and how we have built one

254
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,080
and then most importantly i want to

255
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,959
invite you to join us in the experiment

256
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,080
because

257
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
jumping to the end and telling you we're

258
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
actually running this on a test bed

259
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
right now i'll tell you more about it

260
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
the testbed as we go through it but you

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
can join us and make predictions right

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
now and here's the hot news for all the

263
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
students uh

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
there are cash prizes

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,279
if you if you're the winner in the

266
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,240
tournament

267
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
you'll get money

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
actual cash money which is pretty cool i

269
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
think uh uh so the link is here is it

270
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,399
with a company called metacalculus and

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
it's the white hat cyber tournament

272
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
because of course we want good things to

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,079
come of this not black hat things to

274
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,680
come with this so

275
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
my last pitch which is my first pitch is

276
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,959
to ask you to come and play we got lots

277
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
of questions we could you

278
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
use the wisdom of the crowds

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
so what is crowd forecasting

280
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,680
the main idea here is that if you

281
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,040
accumulate

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,320
information

283
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
amongst a large enough number of people

284
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
who are incentivized to actually give

285
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
you their experience about future events

286
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,120
uh

287
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,160
that

288
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
group of people

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,839
will

290
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,000
more accurately than not

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
predict the likelihood or the likeliness

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
of future outcomes now i put trained

293
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
in parentheses there because one of the

294
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
questions that people

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
are still debating in

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
in the field of crowd forecasting is

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,079
whether or not

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
the intelligent amateur

299
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
is as good as a trained professional

300
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
clearly there are some cases

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
where the intelligent amateur

302
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
can play with anybody else i

303
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
follow american baseball all the time

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
i really spend a lot of time playing but

305
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,160
i'm an amateur ad but my predictions are

306
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,360
probably almost as good as the guys on

307
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
espn tv with respect to how my beloved

308
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
washington nationals are going to do

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
this year uh

310
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
one of the questions the propositions

311
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
that we're kind of asking about cyber

312
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
security is whether or not

313
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
we need to limit the scope of who can

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,040
play to people who are in the field in

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
some way or another or whether or not

316
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
cyber security it spans so large a

317
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
domain

318
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
of enterprises and geopolitical and

319
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
policy and law questions that we should

320
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,639
open it up i don't actually know the

321
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
answer to that i hope to be able to tell

322
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
you in six months uh

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,440
but the idea here which is the good idea

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
is that

325
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
a lot of people acting together

326
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
can actually

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
uh make better predictions than one

328
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
person actually acting seemingly the

329
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
genesis of this is uh is actually quite

330
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
famous it's a

331
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
i don't know how many of you have ever

332
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
gone to carnivals and been asked to

333
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
predict the number of jelly beans in a

334
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,320
large jelly bean jar right which often

335
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
has like a thousand jelly beans in it

336
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,320
and it turns out that individually

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
people are really bad at that

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
but that if you take all the predictions

339
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
of all the people who go through the

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
carnival

341
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
in a week or a month

342
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
you basically get the right answer

343
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,560
uh you know plus or minus five percent

344
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
it's an amazing it's been repeated a

345
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
number of times an experimental thing

346
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
somehow the wisdom of the crowds

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,360
converges on the right answer

348
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
uh so uh

349
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
there are

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
two types of prediction markets that we

351
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,240
can talk about

352
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
one is a prediction market itself

353
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,560
uh which is basically yes or no

354
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
uh answer yes or no answers to a

355
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
question so for example uh will joseph

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
biden be re-elected president in 2024

357
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,160
yes no that's a simple yes no uh inquiry

358
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
that we can resolve

359
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
the other

360
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
which is more informative but more

361
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
difficult to operate but also i think

362
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
more useful is probability elicitation

363
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,399
yo what do you think are the chances

364
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
that joseph biden will be re-elected

365
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,959
president and perhaps staff thinks it's

366
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
80 and i think it's 60

367
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,680
and trinity thinks it's 20

368
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,000
and eventually we converge on a number

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
that says

370
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
this far out the crowd senses that it's

371
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
65 percent likely that it'll be

372
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
reelected um that's obviously an example

373
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
because i don't know what the the real

374
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
answer is

375
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
what i have to tell you though

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,760
is that the history of prediction

377
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
markets like this

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
was born in

379
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
uh controversy but is now commonality

380
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the controversy the first time the u.s

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
government ever thought about running a

382
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
prediction market like this was right

383
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,199
after the uh 9 11 attacks on the twin

384
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,959
towers uh

385
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,920
the uh

386
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
darpa the defense advanced research

387
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
projects administration

388
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,839
opened up something called a terrorism

389
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,079
prediction market where they asked their

390
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
analysts to collectively predict what

391
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,639
the next type of attack would be

392
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,360
from uh the bad guys

393
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
um as soon as that became publicly known

394
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
it was shut down

395
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,160
because the idea of american analysts

396
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
betting on

397
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
terrorist events was

398
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,720
anathema you know it just was a horrible

399
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
idea and it didn't look good publicly

400
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
and so the us government's approach to

401
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,399
this

402
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,680
went quiet for about 10 years

403
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,079
not so the rest of the world today

404
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,560
prediction markets are robust and you

405
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
can find them everywhere

406
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
most companies

407
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
use prediction markets for internal

408
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
prediction regarding say product

409
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,639
delivery if you were working

410
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
hypothetically at microsoft they would

411
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,639
ask the people who are working on

412
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,720
you know windows 12 or whatever the next

413
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
instantiation is going to be um yo the

414
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
managers tell us it's going to be

415
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
delivered in third quarter 2024. what do

416
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,199
you think

417
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
and the engineers working on it would

418
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
reach a consensus they said nope it'll

419
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,920
be third quarter 2025

420
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
don't listen to the managers they're

421
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,680
they're selling you uh so

422
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,320
that would be a a robust prediction that

423
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
has usually been proven very useful

424
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
inside internal companies

425
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
we have learned i have learned over the

426
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,199
la with my friend my colleague mary over

427
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
the last five years that uh most of the

428
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
us government intelligence community are

429
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,759
running prediction markets about events

430
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
uh like predictions about russia's

431
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
invasion of the ukraine i can't tell you

432
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
anymore because i don't know anymore

433
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,279
because i don't i have not been read

434
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,880
into them but we've been told that they

435
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,680
exist the financial industry

436
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,560
uses this all of the time

437
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,279
uh for predictions uh uh about uh

438
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
stock trends new products that sort of

439
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,880
thing quite robustly mostly internally

440
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,760
mostly on pr on proprietary platforms

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
that they use as a as a form of

442
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,039
financial advantage and of course

443
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,760
probably the half of you on the

444
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,439
on the on the um uh

445
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,559
video

446
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
who i can't see raise your hand if you

447
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
yo if you do a fantasy football league

448
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
that's essentially a prediction market

449
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,039
in which

450
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,600
your compete you are collectively making

451
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
predictions about the outcome of the

452
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
football game and you're competing

453
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,400
against each other as to whose

454
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
predictions can be best

455
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
so that's kind of um

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,799
the basics of crowd for crowd

457
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,960
forecasting

458
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
how would we use it

459
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
in cyber security

460
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,080
well

461
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
uh

462
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
sorry uh i

463
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
i gotta keep getting my clock up because

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
i can't i

465
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
the screen i don't see the time over

466
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,799
there so

467
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
the first question

468
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
is what do i want this to do what do we

469
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,400
want a cyber security crowd forecasting

470
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
platform to do

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
what i've mostly been describing is

472
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
what the what the people who work in

473
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
this field called information

474
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
aggregation

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,919
disparate pieces of information held by

476
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,080
disparate people come together in a

477
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
crowd

478
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
uh group

479
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
and wind up uh making a substantial

480
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
prediction

481
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,440
they also sometimes characterize this as

482
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,520
noise reduction

483
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
because

484
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
one of the things that this

485
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,840
that crowd forecasting does is it tends

486
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,280
to identify

487
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
outliers

488
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,559
now we don't focus too much on that

489
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,640
functionality because as i'm sure you're

490
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,480
all aware even

491
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
outliers are sometimes right

492
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
right one of the weaknesses of crowd

493
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,360
forecasting is that it isn't that good

494
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
at predicting black swan events

495
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
uh the outliers are

496
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,120
the right actors but they are

497
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,760
you know not the common not the common

498
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,640
answer so that's a a problem with crowd

499
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
firecasting that we have to acknowledge

500
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
as a limitation on its ability to assist

501
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
us in

502
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,039
uh in making uh predictions about future

503
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,320
cybersecurity events but nonetheless uh

504
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
it can

505
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
tend to

506
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
eliminate the noise of outliers so i'm

507
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
sure you've all experienced the noisy

508
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
person in class who shouts too much and

509
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
takes over the class discussion uh who's

510
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,840
wrong um that person gets gets weeded

511
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
out of this

512
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,640
on the other hand

513
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
as the financial industry uh example

514
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,320
tells you

515
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
predictions can also become an actual

516
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,080
asset class of value to somebody uh in

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
the context of cyber security uh that

518
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
would maybe be the insurance industry

519
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
who would want to know use this as a

520
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,799
tool for rating risks and charging

521
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,720
premiums in a way that better uh

522
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
approximated the true future risk of

523
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,640
certain cyber incidents and effects so

524
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
are we doing this for people to make

525
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,039
money or are we doing it

526
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
for information aggregation and if we're

527
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
doing it for information aggregation are

528
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
we doing it for researchers uh so that

529
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
people like staff can uh and and you

530
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
guys can figure out what to what to look

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
into next or are we doing it for policy

532
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,159
makers like me uh and in the end at

533
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,840
least tentatively

534
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
we've decided to focus on information

535
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
aggregation for policymakers trying to

536
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
get consensus views about obscure issues

537
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
um

538
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
as we go forward to uh enable them to

539
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
make decisions

540
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
with less

541
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
of the veil of ignorance of future

542
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,919
events

543
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
um

544
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
second question that we need to ask in

545
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
kind of structuring this is how do we

546
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,039
get people to play

547
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,120
uh in the us government for example they

548
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
can't give out money so they give out

549
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,480
like uh awards and gold stars so all of

550
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,880
a sudden the the the uh

551
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
the leaderboard will say paul rosenzweig

552
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,640
is the best predictor this year and you

553
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
know if i go into the cafeteria at the

554
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
cia everybody say hey there goes paul

555
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,240
rosenzweig he's the best predictor in

556
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
the cia this year um

557
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,799
uh

558
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,039
we have concluded that obviously at this

559
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,320
point we can't make uh we can't just do

560
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,159
that we want to incentivize people which

561
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,720
is why uh we've gone the more

562
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
traditional method which is awarding

563
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
people money prizes in order to

564
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,919
participate in an event like this um

565
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
and then

566
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,039
you got to make it happen and here i

567
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,640
want to shout out uh our uh friends and

568
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
colleagues at metaculous uh you should

569
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
go there and see they've got open

570
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
predictions on everything from covid in

571
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,280
the future to the ukraine war to

572
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
political predictions

573
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
to uh global climate change

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
anything that has a future

575
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
uh event ahead of it that can be

576
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
predicted

577
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
is uh

578
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
is possibly on there they have a few

579
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,840
limitations

580
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,640
for example uh one of the questions i

581
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
wanted to ask

582
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
uh in our cyber security platform is um

583
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,159
obviously we are uh bedeviled in the

584
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,400
united states by ransomware

585
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,520
and there are many uh defensive

586
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,000
researchers who are working uh all the

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
time at uncovering ransomware uh uh uh

588
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,360
uh

589
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,400
ttps and negating them if they can as

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,799
well as backtracking bitcoin wallets and

591
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
the like to disincentivize ransomware

592
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,159
they've been so successful that one of

593
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,760
the things i sort of think may happen

594
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,919
someday is that the criminals who are

595
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,320
actually real bad guys might physically

596
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,960
target uh white hat ransomware

597
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
researchers uh with violence and i

598
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,120
wanted to ask that question and see if

599
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
anybody else agreed with me and they

600
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,679
said they wouldn't bet on people being

601
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,280
killed which

602
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
made a lot of sense to me but with that

603
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
limitation

604
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
uh pretty much any question you might

605
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
want to ask is available

606
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
uh

607
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
there are however some operational

608
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
issues that we have to think about

609
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,880
in um

610
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
uh

611
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,000
in asking such questions uh one is the

612
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,279
question of

613
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,320
uh resolvability or settlement

614
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
that is to say how do we know when the

615
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
question is answered and what the answer

616
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,120
is

617
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
take for example the ukrainian question

618
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,640
when i asked are would russian troops be

619
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,320
out of ukraine by the end of 2020

620
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,039
that requires us before we start playing

621
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,440
the game to have a definition of russian

622
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,919
troops you could imagine it would be

623
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
russian troops in uniform or it might be

624
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
irregular russian troops and what does

625
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,919
it mean to be out of the ukraine does

626
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,840
that

627
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
include the portions of the ukraine like

628
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
crimea that they were in before the war

629
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
started or would that not count

630
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,720
you can answer those and whichever

631
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,559
answer you choose is kind of arbitrary

632
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
but you need to be able to resolve the

633
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
question so for example

634
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,159
i wouldn't ask a question like will

635
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
there be a major

636
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,679
uh

637
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,720
outage

638
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
at amazon web services in 2022

639
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,279
without

640
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,159
defining talking to somebody like staff

641
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,799
and asking him what he thinks a a

642
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
definition of major would be how many

643
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
customers affected for how long a period

644
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
of time you know so it wouldn't be five

645
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
customers for 20 minutes but it would be

646
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
a million customers for 24 hours

647
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,840
uh and we would set that threshold in

648
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
advance and be transparent about but

649
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,120
there's a uh

650
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
a

651
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,279
settlement question that requires us to

652
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
you know kind of define our terms and

653
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
that's

654
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,799
more difficult in the cyber realm where

655
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
there's a lot of ambiguity

656
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,640
in some of the things yo will a

657
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
cyber attack on a piece of critical

658
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,080
infrastructure be attributed

659
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,320
to the chinese in 2022

660
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
attributed by whom

661
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,240
and when i say the chinese do i mean a

662
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,960
chinese person do i mean an irregular

663
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
group or do i mean a group that us

664
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,559
intelligence assesses is tied to the to

665
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,720
the people's liberation army who knows

666
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
you have to make those definitions and

667
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,760
in our case

668
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,799
that's

669
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,960
much harder than

670
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720
it's easy to resolve the question will

671
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,240
joe biden be re-elected in 2024 because

672
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
we will know when he takes the oath of

673
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,200
office in 2025 yes or no

674
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
second problem with cyber is that a lot

675
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
of our questions are technical or niche

676
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
kind of questions

677
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
um and so

678
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
we need to generate enough predictions

679
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,360
there's a robust science as you would

680
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,320
expect involving statistical uh

681
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
evaluation that says that um you know

682
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
you know 10 predictions is really not

683
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,799
enough

684
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,919
50 is starting to get there 100 or 150

685
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,159
is better there yeah the more the

686
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,679
merrier

687
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,919
there are two other um uh uh

688
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,279
possibilities uh that we we need to take

689
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
into account and we're gonna try and

690
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
we've tried we we're gonna explore

691
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
whether or not we've succeeded one is

692
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,279
platform manipulation or the moral

693
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,480
hazard problem

694
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
so i mean one of the reasons that uh

695
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
mitaculous doesn't allow questions like

696
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
will there be attacks

697
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,919
on cybersecurity physical attacks on

698
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
cybersecurity researchers is they're

699
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
afraid that someone like me might bet

700
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,520
heavily yes and then go out and try and

701
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,320
kill

702
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,679
a a researcher so that i win my bed so

703
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,760
we've tried to structure the questions

704
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
in ways that are immune from

705
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,039
manipulation by the participants in the

706
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,679
uh in the field again we're seeing

707
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,080
whether or not we're very successful at

708
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
that or not uh so far

709
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,440
uh we think we have okay

710
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
uh and then the the last kind of

711
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
challenge is the challenge of privileged

712
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,760
information

713
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,440
uh aka confidential information it's not

714
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
cool if

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
everybody isn't on the same playing

716
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,840
field and if some of the participants uh

717
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
you know if you were asking a question

718
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
about the invasion of ukraine and one of

719
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,679
the participants had access to uh uh

720
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,120
us government satellite photos that

721
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
showed the invasion was starting and

722
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,960
others did not that would would mess up

723
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,360
the question a bit so we think we've

724
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,039
answered some of those questions but

725
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
it's important to

726
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,039
make clear that

727
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,600
cloud forecasting is a tool it has

728
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,640
limitations and it's um

729
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
it's not universal in its applicability

730
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
so

731
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
uh

732
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,120
what have we done

733
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
this is uh before i show you some

734
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,960
questions tell you a little bit we have

735
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,039
as i said started a white hat hacking uh

736
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,360
cyber forecasting challenge here's the

737
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,480
uh

738
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
url again uh we opened last month we're

739
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
still we're taking predictions there are

740
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
about

741
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,799
uh 60 questions out there i'm going to

742
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,440
show you a few in the next slide

743
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,039
we decided to make it an open

744
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
competition not to limit it to people we

745
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,559
uh we thought were smart about cyber

746
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,039
security but anybody who wanted to play

747
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,360
we also invited a number of our friends

748
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
and participants

749
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
uh

750
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
friends to become participants uh one of

751
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
the reasons i'm here today is that uh

752
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,120
your professor and i spath and i are

753
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
part of a cyber discussion group and i

754
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,240
invited everybody there uh to come and

755
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
play and he said well why don't you come

756
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,520
to uh purdue and tell us about it as

757
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,200
well um

758
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
and now i'm inviting you because you're

759
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
serious students and you are would

760
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,039
likely uh be valuable participants we've

761
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
released three waves of questions

762
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,440
uh we are actually

763
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,120
scheduled some of them

764
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,240
to resolve by the end of of may so the

765
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
end of next month

766
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,919
uh and the reason is we wanted to have

767
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,919
some results to report at our rsa talk

768
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,880
in june so if you come to rsa and come

769
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,480
to this talk you'll hear much of the

770
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
same thing except mary will be talking

771
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
more and she's a better speaker than i

772
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,159
and you'll get to see some answers to

773
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,440
the questions um the tournament itself

774
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
will close on december 31st but because

775
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,919
some of the questions trail in their

776
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,360
resolution we will award prizes in june

777
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
of 2023.

778
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
uh uh and like i said there's a thousand

779
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,399
bucks i think it is to the winner so

780
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
there's real money come and play so by

781
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,000
now you've probably gotten to the point

782
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,399
of saying like

783
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,320
what the heck is he talking about this

784
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
has all been theoretical um

785
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,520
what does he mean what are the types of

786
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
questions that could possibly be

787
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,520
resolved in this kind of format in a

788
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,799
sensible way so we've reduced

789
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,760
or we've subdivided the ground into

790
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,240
three separate kinds of categories

791
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,039
um first we've recognized that cyber

792
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,240
security

793
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,039
plays on the international stage

794
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,000
it's a geopolitical question that is uh

795
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,039
influences governments and policy makers

796
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,919
and

797
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
large corporations across the globe

798
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,279
so we've asked a group of geopolitical

799
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,840
questions government related questions

800
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
um

801
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
then

802
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
we've recognized that many of the

803
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,159
questions are about

804
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,399
industry-wide practices

805
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,600
niches

806
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,399
industry-wide phenomena that we care

807
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,200
about um you know like the question

808
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
about aws

809
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,240
um then we've third one is a more

810
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,399
technical of

811
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,120
incident related stuff that is probably

812
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,360
uh more tactical so if you want to think

813
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,279
of these think of these as the strategic

814
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,679
level sets of questions the operational

815
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,679
sets of levels of questions and then the

816
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,000
technical sets of questions and then for

817
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
each group we started asking ourselves

818
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
what are the types of things that policy

819
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,559
makers and researchers might want to

820
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,360
know

821
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
and then how can we craft a question

822
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,760
that is resolvable that is settleable

823
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
that we can answer

824
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,399
yes no

825
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,240
and

826
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,039
um

827
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,880
define it so for example

828
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,320
we want to know geopolitically you know

829
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
the nature of china's uh aggression

830
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,960
towards taiwan

831
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,360
will it go up will it go down will it

832
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,440
stay the same this is a geopolitically

833
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,200
important question to the united states

834
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
it's probably a geopolitically important

835
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
question to china and i would love if

836
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,279
some chinese people were to participate

837
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,760
in this in this uh crowdsourcing because

838
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,480
that would make the answers more robust

839
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,679
and so

840
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,679
we can we have one question there will

841
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,480
china launch a successful major cyber

842
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,120
attack on chinese critical taiwanese

843
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,360
critical infrastructure before december

844
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,320
31st 2022 and if you go and look at the

845
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,480
question there's a whole discussion of

846
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,039
settlement how do we define major what

847
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,080
do we define as successful and uh the

848
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,519
reason it uh

849
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,279
the what this is one of the examples of

850
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,360
something that will resolve

851
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,279
possibly afterwards

852
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,279
but it may not become publicly known for

853
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,679
six months or frankly it may not become

854
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,840
publicly known for two years if such a

855
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
thing were to happen but we set a cutoff

856
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,519
date for publicly

857
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,120
known of june 30th 2023 for that

858
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
question so that gives you an example of

859
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,919
how we define settlement and why we

860
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,880
define resolution

861
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,240
six months after the question closes

862
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,799
industry a huge question right now a

863
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,880
huge problem right now is the worldwide

864
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,320
chip shortage

865
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
yeah and everybody i know would like to

866
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,200
know if it's going to end anytime soon

867
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,799
if the supply chain problems are going

868
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,720
to be mitigated

869
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,600
so

870
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,960
we found a source who who measures

871
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,440
semiconductor chip lead times that is

872
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
the amount of time between order and

873
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,519
delivery and right now it's running i

874
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
think last time i looked something like

875
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,559
22 to 24 weeks

876
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,159
so we thought okay

877
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,799
a good question to ask is will the semi

878
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,880
average semiconductor chip lead time as

879
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,320
defined by this uh you know uh uh

880
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,440
industry standard measurement uh

881
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
fall below 15 weeks

882
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,320
before july 1 of 2022.

883
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
uh

884
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,960
who knows

885
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,760
uh you by the way can't see the what

886
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,560
other people are predicting uh early on

887
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,918
but towards the end of the of the system

888
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,159
will will reveal where the where the

889
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,000
answers are trending but right now if

890
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,839
you went you'd have to make a prediction

891
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,159
based upon your own assessment

892
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,520
maybe you do some research maybe you

893
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,399
don't

894
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,879
so a technical incident question of the

895
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
sort that we would like to know the

896
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,639
answer to is okay good i'm running

897
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
pretty good here uh

898
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,280
uh uh would be um is it really a good

899
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,520
idea to rely on commercial online

900
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,560
identify identity services the irs

901
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,800
thought so they announced the that's the

902
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
american internal revenue service they

903
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,960
announced they were going to use id.me

904
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,520
to identify people for payment and then

905
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,199
they they stopped because other people

906
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,960
thought it was a bad idea and it was

907
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,160
half bait

908
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,480
um but we thought well why not we test

909
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
that will it be publicly reported that a

910
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,200
popular online identity verification

911
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
service and we listed the ones that we

912
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,359
thought would count like ibm was

913
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,640
breached

914
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,000
in 2022 and that too will resolve by

915
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,240
january by june of 2023 um

916
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,119
so

917
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,720
perhaps now that i've described this you

918
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
have some opinions about this you have

919
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
opinions about whether or not there'll

920
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
be a successful attack on a space-based

921
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
cyber system in 2022

922
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
if you do

923
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,920
come play

924
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,000
um

925
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
so uh

926
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,079
where does that leave me going forward

927
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,520
and you know i'm getting to the point

928
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,640
where i can

929
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,079
take some questions from you in a few

930
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,359
minutes uh

931
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,520
first thing we're gonna finish the real

932
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,400
world beta test that we're running

933
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,359
over the next uh you know nine months

934
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,280
ten months and then obviously we're

935
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,119
going to report out our results uh in

936
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,400
publish it somewhere

937
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,119
um don't know where yet uh

938
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,119
if it's warranted

939
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,760
we may try and operationalize if it if

940
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
it works if we think that by and large

941
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
we're actually getting the lessons

942
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,680
learned from the tester that we get

943
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,480
useful information that people can can

944
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
use successfully

945
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
uh then

946
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
we might try and find somebody who wants

947
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,040
to do it on a more routine eyes basis um

948
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
obviously

949
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,599
we can't continue to fund it uh

950
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,480
unless we get a uh a sugar daddy

951
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,079
foundation who wants to fund it and

952
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,560
somebody else to pay metaculous who who

953
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,320
are giving us their time and energy for

954
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,440
free thank you again mittacus um and you

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,079
can join us if we i i've dropped i've

956
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,520
given you the url we also have a uh a

957
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
place you can send emails with questions

958
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,839
the

959
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,800
cyberpredictionbetagmail.com it lands on

960
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,119
my desk and i'll answer you um

961
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,760
and so that's kind of

962
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,480
my talk as i said

963
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,760
crowd forecasting is wildly used

964
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
in the rest of the world

965
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
policy makers just haven't put it to use

966
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,640
very much and cyber security policy

967
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,200
makers as far as we can tell

968
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,560
almost never in the last 15 years

969
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,400
will it be a good thing

970
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
i tend to think so

971
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,480
um the indications are that it's a

972
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,240
useful tool elsewhere and i can't think

973
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,760
of any reason why it wouldn't be useful

974
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,960
here

975
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,520
or i can that it's too technically

976
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,400
intricate to be useful to to to warrant

977
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,599
it but that's what the test is for the

978
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,240
proposition is that we can use it to

979
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,359
make

980
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,839
good crowd forecasting estimates of

981
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,480
probable outcomes in the future and that

982
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
that would be of some utility so with

983
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,079
that

984
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,640
i'm going to stop sharing my screen

985
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,599
uh

986
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,240
and i went for 40 minutes

987
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
39 minutes which is what you asked for

988
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,760
and i would be happy to answer questions

989
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
so i see

990
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,880
one in the um in the chat

991
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
how effective is crowd forecasting when

992
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,240
using unqualified people like the open

993
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,079
one you just talked about i could say

994
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,920
that the chip shortage isn't going to

995
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
end but i don't know what i'm talking

996
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,440
about

997
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,359
well that's a great that's

998
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,160
that's the proposition i intend to test

999
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,440
um

1000
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,520
there or we intend to test uh

1001
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,400
unqualified people can do research uh

1002
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
you know if the incentives were enough

1003
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,119
you jack would would you know go and do

1004
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,200
some looking into things that you

1005
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,520
thought were relevant to it and make a

1006
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,880
prediction

1007
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
what um

1008
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,839
there are basically two branches of

1009
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,320
thought in the field generally

1010
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,599
one is

1011
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,480
that

1012
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,760
only trained people are effective

1013
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,320
um the other is that you can train

1014
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
people on how to be effective inquirers

1015
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
so they're not trained in the s in the

1016
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,520
field itself in cyber security but they

1017
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
learn how to become effective at

1018
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
making

1019
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,760
probabilistic predictions of future

1020
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
events

1021
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,760
and

1022
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,560
um

1023
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,240
you know there are several uh

1024
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,040
studies that suggest that that in fact

1025
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,599
the unqualified who are incentivized and

1026
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,359
learn how to learn

1027
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,320
are as good if not better than trained

1028
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,280
people uh i'm not sure that that would

1029
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,040
work in a

1030
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,599
tech field like cyber security on the

1031
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
other hand the

1032
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,599
uh the geopolitical questions that we're

1033
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,839
asking sometimes aren't really cyber

1034
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,599
security questions at all

1035
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,839
um they have cyber security implications

1036
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,359
but they're really more international

1037
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,760
relations questions about you know

1038
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,839
russia's uh

1039
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
takedown i we actually opened the

1040
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
question would russia uh do a critical

1041
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
incident assault on the ukraine and

1042
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,119
three hours later it was publicly

1043
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,200
reported that it did so

1044
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,599
we we had to take that question down

1045
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
um

1046
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,200
so uh

1047
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,000
uh

1048
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,240
so the answer to your question formally

1049
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,920
is i don't know

1050
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,800
and i hope to be able to tell you better

1051
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,560
when we're done

1052
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,520
um

1053
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
next question

1054
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
uh

1055
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,359
i'm an actuarial scientist all those

1056
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,800
well odds are i will be working in

1057
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
insurance so predicting future events is

1058
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,400
really important to me

1059
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
how would an insurance agent use

1060
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
crowdsourcing to learn about rates and

1061
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
methods well that's a great question um

1062
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,040
rhian so here's how here's here's what

1063
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
i understand it

1064
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,599
uh

1065
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,119
to work in the insurance field and i'm

1066
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,359
not an actuarial science student so

1067
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,359
forgive me what i get wrong but right

1068
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,800
now today

1069
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,839
um

1070
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,640
there's the insurance industry

1071
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
is in a bit of a crisis

1072
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
why

1073
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,200
because their

1074
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
past actuarial models for incidences of

1075
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
catastrophic natural disasters like

1076
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,119
hurricanes and tornadoes

1077
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,760
are being thrown all out of whack

1078
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
the frequency is is through the roof in

1079
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,359
the last 10 years

1080
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,800
vis-a-vis our historical models um

1081
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
you know the suspicion of course is that

1082
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,160
it's related to global climate change

1083
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
but i don't know anything about that so

1084
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
i'm not going to say that but i know

1085
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,839
that it's the case that it's out of

1086
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,880
whack

1087
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,240
and so

1088
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
uh

1089
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,400
in an actuarial sense they mostly

1090
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,680
uh

1091
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
uh use

1092
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
um

1093
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,520
um uh you know past practice instead

1094
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,880
they might want to use a future

1095
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,240
predictive model of this sort asking uh

1096
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,319
climatologists what they think the

1097
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,000
incidents would be i'm sorry staff i

1098
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,359
didn't see the note that said you wanted

1099
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,720
to answer this line i apologize

1100
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,400
no i'm just i'm just doing that to

1101
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,839
indicate that you're answering it live

1102
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,880
then i'll delete it oh oh okay okay i

1103
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,319
didn't know that whether that meant you

1104
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,480
wanted to speak

1105
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,960
okay so uh so

1106
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,760
that would be a you know oh

1107
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,960
my way

1108
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,079
of of suggesting that even in

1109
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,480
traditional actuarial fields where your

1110
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,440
past models are being distorted by new

1111
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,720
events

1112
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,000
uh predictive models that

1113
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,720
say the incidence i mean you would ask a

1114
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,160
question like will the incidence of

1115
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,760
hurricane go up 10

1116
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,119
or 50

1117
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,720
in the next 10 years

1118
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,440
and try and base your rates on that so

1119
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,839
you might ask in the insurance industry

1120
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,640
um

1121
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
uh you know whether the frequency of

1122
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,920
ransomware attacks has peaked

1123
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
because our responses are becoming more

1124
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
effective or whether we can anticipate a

1125
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,839
uh you know a four-fold step function up

1126
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,640
in the next 10 years uh in which case

1127
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,079
then you charge

1128
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,160
vastly different rates depending upon

1129
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,520
what you thought the answer was and what

1130
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,720
you thought the

1131
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,400
accuracy of that answer was i mean you'd

1132
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
have to think it was accurate too

1133
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,680
but if you did think it was accurate

1134
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,040
you'd make your bet

1135
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,279
um

1136
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,240
uh

1137
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,560
um anonymous attendee i'm going to have

1138
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,520
to about seeing the the predictions i

1139
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,760
believe that you're probably are you

1140
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,839
looking at the white hat ones because i

1141
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,079
don't think that those are public yet

1142
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
but perhaps they are uh in which case

1143
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,640
they've accumulated enough votes that

1144
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,520
they think that it doesn't matter uh if

1145
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,040
they bias you a bit by letting you know

1146
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,720
what others are thinking that the

1147
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,040
general answer there is they they keep

1148
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,920
it closed for the first intro period and

1149
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,319
then they open it live i'm not sure

1150
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,359
um

1151
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,280
exactly what their criteria is i'd have

1152
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,119
to it's a good question i'll have to get

1153
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,880
back to you sorry about that some of

1154
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,119
them some of them are closed

1155
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,800
i've answered all the white hat and i've

1156
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
answered all the ukrainian ones

1157
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,440
and some of them are some of them are

1158
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,000
uh not showing anybody else yet but

1159
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
quite a few have numbers

1160
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,800
okay

1161
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,680
well

1162
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,560
uh

1163
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,839
uh i i i suppose i better educate myself

1164
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,839
again on exactly why

1165
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,920
when it is they make that determination

1166
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,000
so that if this question gets asked rsa

1167
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
i can answer it

1168
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,960
um

1169
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,000
uh

1170
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,240
drew asked are policymakers themselves

1171
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,160
allowed to make predictions based on the

1172
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,400
laws they pass or consider that's a

1173
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,960
great question

1174
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,079
for the test we are uh not excluding

1175
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,119
anybody

1176
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,800
because we didn't think that any

1177
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,599
lawmakers or policy makers of sufficient

1178
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,599
import would actually want to come and

1179
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,119
play uh but my understanding

1180
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,920
is

1181
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,720
that

1182
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,319
uh inside some of the government i in uh

1183
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,280
intelligence community um

1184
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,839
uh markets they actually do let the

1185
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,160
senior leadership play as well even

1186
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,359
though they might be part of the

1187
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
decision making because it's thought

1188
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,880
that they might actually have a broader

1189
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
scope of information must be making

1190
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,599
better predictions that after all is

1191
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,119
sort of why

1192
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,680
they tend to become senior leaders

1193
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,960
uh that in longevity of course but in

1194
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,319
theory they're becoming senior leaders

1195
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,680
because they actually are better at

1196
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,040
their jobs and so uh

1197
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
uh and so um

1198
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,440
what you might uh

1199
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,560
um

1200
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,920
uh

1201
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
you might not want to exclude from from

1202
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,200
playing

1203
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,040
the people who you think are the best at

1204
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,160
doing this

1205
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,520
uh

1206
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,240
uh it would be i think probably wrong to

1207
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
do that in a

1208
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,400
market where there were actual rewards

1209
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,359
and prizes other than acknowledgement

1210
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,240
and and a gold star and your name uh up

1211
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,319
on the wall for a month uh because that

1212
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,640
would that would incentivize people to

1213
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
game the system

1214
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
and win money but

1215
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,200
otherwise no

1216
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,680
ah brian our professionals opinions

1217
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,040
waited more uh

1218
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,680
fascinating question

1219
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,359
because the answer is you can do it that

1220
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,560
way

1221
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,680
i i we can ha we can create we have not

1222
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
at this point the test we are running is

1223
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,240
an everybody counts the same

1224
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,000
you me staff whoever but there is

1225
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,319
absolutely nothing in the world

1226
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,839
um that

1227
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,960
prevents a platform operator from

1228
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,200
waiting uh

1229
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,319
expert

1230
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,560
expert answers better then the question

1231
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,480
is how do you become an uh how do you

1232
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
define an expert and that gets back to

1233
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,800
my two paths that we were talking about

1234
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
some platforms

1235
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,520
weight experts based upon

1236
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,640
um

1237
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,720
their external expertise so they would

1238
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,240
give a fast prediction more weight on a

1239
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,839
technical matter than mine because he's

1240
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,680
been doing it a lot longer he's a

1241
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,599
technical expert and i'm not

1242
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,400
other

1243
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,200
platforms including some

1244
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,520
some of the uh

1245
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,359
questions that mitaculous

1246
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,440
weight people based upon how good

1247
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,040
they've been in the past

1248
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,280
i am a super predictor

1249
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,839
i i'm not but they there are super

1250
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,359
predictors or

1251
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,960
better predictors than you and me than

1252
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,240
random who are outliers in their ability

1253
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
to actually answer questions

1254
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,280
and make sensible predictions

1255
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,839
who spend a lot of time working uh on uh

1256
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,079
not working but playing

1257
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,559
on them attack metaculous

1258
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,079
website and

1259
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,119
you know so metaculous in some context

1260
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,760
can and does give their answers greater

1261
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,520
weight

1262
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,640
i think that's fascinating

1263
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,839
how many mvp awards do you predict

1264
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,960
juan soto will win um well we're not

1265
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,800
going to be

1266
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,119
able to resolve that question for 15

1267
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,040
years but i think for at least

1268
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,559
um oh that's good question aid aiden how

1269
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,480
how we predicted against bots and mass

1270
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
prediction um and the answer to that one

1271
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,400
is is is pretty easy um uh

1272
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,920
if you're playing on metacalculus you

1273
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,640
have to log in and get an id you can

1274
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,280
predict anonymously

1275
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,839
on the on the website but it's pseudo

1276
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,800
anonymous as to metaculous you have to

1277
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,280
verify an identity and

1278
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
you know obviously that can be spoofed

1279
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,839
as we all know at some point but it it

1280
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,079
doesn't seem like it's worth it at least

1281
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,160
not for the pennies that we're we're

1282
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,960
playing for at mitacuous um

1283
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,440
i imagine uh that would be a more

1284
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,960
significant problem that we would have

1285
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,559
to uh

1286
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,720
address if we actually operationalize

1287
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,680
this and we're using it to say

1288
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,079
uh price insurance products or something

1289
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,559
like that

1290
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,280
what was that stuff you got one question

1291
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,200
at the beginning of the q a that i think

1292
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,400
you missed

1293
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,240
which was grippy oh i see that yeah uh

1294
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,000
how do people's wants affect that it

1295
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,200
might be

1296
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
yes they can

1297
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,599
um you can make a prediction on on any

1298
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,160
basis you want um the assumption of

1299
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,200
course

1300
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,160
is that people's wants um would not be

1301
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,599
terribly effective

1302
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,000
in actually uh

1303
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,359
uh resolving uh to the right answer now

1304
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,040
i can predict all i want that um

1305
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,480
what do i want

1306
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,880
badly that the gnats will win the world

1307
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,119
series this year since we we talked

1308
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,520
we've done baseball three times now but

1309
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,280
all that all the wants in the world

1310
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,040
ain't gonna make that happen this year

1311
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,440
because they're now

1312
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,480
three in

1313
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,800
there two and uh three and three for

1314
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,480
three and four and they ain't going to

1315
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,599
get above 500 this year sorry

1316
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,000
uh uh uh other than wrong uh

1317
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,880
uh policymakers are allowed to interact

1318
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,280
in the stock market drew and that and

1319
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,520
people say that's bad i mean right now

1320
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,440
there's a move in congress to prevent to

1321
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,640
prohibit

1322
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,920
uh

1323
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,359
congressmen at least from trading

1324
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
individual stocks and require them to

1325
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,400
only buy uh funds you know broad-based

1326
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,559
funds where their decisions won't affect

1327
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,599
their own income but as of today uh

1328
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,800
that's not illegal and there are many

1329
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,200
who think that that is wrong in some

1330
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,680
moral sense it's not illegal so it's not

1331
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,880
wrong in any legal sense um

1332
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,079
and uh

1333
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,960
uh but uh you know in a prediction

1334
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,240
market

1335
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,559
it's a moral hazard if you give somebody

1336
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,920
the ability to

1337
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,800
uh

1338
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,480
to make a prediction and then affect the

1339
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
outcome so that you incentivize them to

1340
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,119
win

1341
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,400
for themselves

1342
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,680
um

1343
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,400
rihanna uh another question i do

1344
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,839
actually have one more cycle to have a

1345
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,359
reference slide if they if you want to

1346
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,960
see it it's bad for you

1347
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,680
i should show it because that way um

1348
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,119
when we close that way it'll be part of

1349
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,319
the recording

1350
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,559
right uh i have another question as

1351
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,720
stocks in general i was wanting to hear

1352
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,559
social media to predict stock changes

1353
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,200
and adjustments

1354
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,919
uh

1355
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,359
social media well what i have learned

1356
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,160
about

1357
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,240
crowd forecasting markets

1358
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,280
is that

1359
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,359
uh

1360
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,558
they have to have

1361
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,359
some sort of structure

1362
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,440
in terms of uh

1363
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,359
settlement and resolvability

1364
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,079
uh ambiguity resolution there are

1365
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,240
sometimes cases in which you throw a

1366
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,839
question out because

1367
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,400
uh it turns out you worded it badly

1368
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,960
there's an adjudicative function there

1369
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,800
there is also

1370
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,839
um

1371
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,680
uh

1372
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,000
in some ways a

1373
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,040
ameliorating or mediating function

1374
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,119
uh if you go to mitacuculus and you have

1375
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,400
a question both mary and i can actually

1376
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,520
answer

1377
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,000
what we mean by the question that we

1378
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,200
asked if you're looking for a

1379
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,920
clarification you'll see a few of those

1380
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,079
those things are much less available in

1381
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,480
social media which is much more

1382
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,599
wild westy and free worldly and

1383
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,119
and all that sort of jazz and so um

1384
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,640
i'm not sure

1385
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,440
that i would uh necessarily

1386
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
think that um

1387
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,680
that it would work as well on a social

1388
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,839
media also

1389
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,880
you know given the anonymity there you'd

1390
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,079
be a lot more susceptible to uh

1391
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,520
manipulation

1392
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,160
uh by bots by people who want to tank

1393
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
your startup uh by people who want to

1394
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,760
pump your startup

1395
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,640
uh

1396
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,440
so

1397
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,000
uh yeah i i imagine

1398
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,760
a as i said a fantasy football league is

1399
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,400
really a social media uh

1400
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,040
aggregate yeah information aggregator

1401
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,119
and uh you know it's worth what you pay

1402
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,880
for it some people

1403
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,240
don't uh

1404
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,559
don't really play that readily with it

1405
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,319
right and and you know so your fantasy

1406
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,839
football league goes off the rails

1407
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,280
because somebody

1408
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,240
yo drafts only tackles

1409
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,240
yeah and has too much fun with it

1410
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,400
um i am going to

1411
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,480
share one last slide with you so that

1412
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,839
you can see

1413
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,440
these are

1414
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,880
some references

1415
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,119
for the work we did um

1416
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,079
obviously uh they're all uh

1417
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,160
uh co-authored with my friend and

1418
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,800
colleague mary brooks uh who is a

1419
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,720
brilliant lady and i hope you all come

1420
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,880
meet her and see her uh at rsa um and uh

1421
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,960
and the white hat cyber challenge link

1422
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,480
is at the end again

1423
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,280
uh

1424
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,960
so you should feel free

1425
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,839
these

1426
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,240
papers have the details the first is

1427
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,640
essentially what is

1428
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,880
crowd forecasting the second is why will

1429
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,280
it work in cyber security and the third

1430
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,839
is how to build a a platform and why we

1431
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,760
made the choices we made and the fourth

1432
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,839
is come play with us so uh

1433
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,359
um i think

1434
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,119
i'm kind of done staff unless there's

1435
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,160
more you want to do well uh i will just

1436
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,440
say to the audience um i have gone

1437
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,319
through

1438
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,920
two of the tournaments and several of

1439
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,359
the independent questions and put my

1440
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,480
rankings in

1441
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,319
so i don't

1442
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
know if you can see mine specifically

1443
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,559
but if you want to compete

1444
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,440
then please go ahead i think it's fun

1445
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,079
takes a little bit of your time and

1446
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,760
you can do wild guessing of course but

1447
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,400
that that isn't the right way to do it

1448
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,160
you can give a reasonably informed

1449
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,240
opinion about many of the items that are

1450
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,520
present

1451
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,720
um and um

1452
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,559
uh i think it's a it's a really

1453
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,040
interesting concept the idea of delphi

1454
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,599
studies of crowd studies have been

1455
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,760
around for a while and i really commend

1456
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,119
you for

1457
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,280
uh putting this this idea forward as a

1458
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,119
way of approaching this i remember i

1459
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,720
remember you uh telling me about this

1460
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,640
three years ago as an idea

1461
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,799
and i'm so pleased to see that you

1462
