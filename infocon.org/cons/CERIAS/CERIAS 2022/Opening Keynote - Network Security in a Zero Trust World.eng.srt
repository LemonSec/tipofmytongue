29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
we admire your technical vision

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
achievements and experiences

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
in cyber security

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
i would also like to express my special

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
thanks to our friends and colleagues

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
from sandia national labs who work hard

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,079
to bring two pre-symposium events to

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,439
campus

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
the first one is the tracer fire camp

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,560
cyber forensic and response training

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
camp that happened this past weekend and

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
the second one is the solas cyber cyber

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,399
physical test bed expo that happened

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,600
yesterday

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
so the turn cyber security has a ever

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
expanding scope today

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
it covers not only the traditional cyber

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
systems and infrastructure such as our

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
data centers our computers and laptops

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
and smartphones it is now expanding to

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
any real-world systems and

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
infrastructure with a cyber component in

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,720
it so correspondingly the cyber security

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
r d education workforce development has

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,800
never been so interdisciplinary and full

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
of new challenges and opportunities

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,760
so to adapt to this trend so we at

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,480
sirius envision the embedding of cyber

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
security in a wide range of discipline

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
we call our vision cyber security plus x

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,319
where x is equal to

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,400
you name it right ai 5g manufacturing

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,599
microelectronics supply chains

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
autonomous vehicles healthcare

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
transportation et cetera so this vision

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
is being reflected by our ongoing r d

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
and education efforts and initiatives

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
and by the topics of the panels and tech

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
talks and posters that you will see

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
later this week in the symposium so the

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
symposium wouldn't be possible and ready

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,879

mentioned the poster session this

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,440
afternoon this afternoon uh is one floor

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
below us the next building over is

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
stewart's center is the i'm sorry is the

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,080
union behind me here uh in the basement

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
of the union

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
is a number of restaurants so if you're

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
looking someplace to grab lunch that is

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
one option the other option is a lot of

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
us will be going to ford dining hall and

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
before you uh wrinkle your nose at that

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,919
purdue has some pretty amazing cafeteria

114
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,960
so

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
so that is an option we will have a bus

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
that will be taking

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
people to that cafeteria back and forth

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
so you can join us there

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
this is march in indiana so inclement

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
weather is certainly possible and

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
regardless of where you're from the joke

122
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,199
is if you don't like

123
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
the weather wait five minutes that

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
certainly applies here but in case of

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
that five minutes is truly bad weather

126
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
we'll head to the basement of this

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
building now when i first started at

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
sirius 16 years ago staff used to make

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
this announcement i thought

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
okay yeah it's probably good to share

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
but you know we can figure this out and

132
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
yes in 2018 if you saw some of these

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
slides we actually had the tornado

134
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
warning go off there was one in our

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
county and we did all move the entire

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
conference to the basement of the

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
building for over an hour

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
all but except about a handful of

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,039
students who devoured everything on the

140
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,919
appetizer table at the poster session we

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,840
came back from the uh from the tornado

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
warning and there was nothing but dirty

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
dishes and empty plates

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
but we were all safe so let's hope that

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
we don't have any weather today with

146
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,560
that

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
coffee

148
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
hot water

149
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,759
are all in the back of the room it will

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
be here this morning it will be in the

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
afternoon so

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
when you have to hear me any talk and

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
start your head starts to nod please

154
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
feel free to get up at any time grab

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
coffee bathrooms are right outside these

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,199
doors here uh as well as in the same

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,919
locations on each floor so if

158
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
there's a line one place we can can go

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,960
to the next one

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
um

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
this event

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
uh often i'm asked to describe it and i

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
try to say that it is not like

164
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
any other cyber security event i know

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
because the true mix of people from

166
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
academia that being both faculty staff

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
not both faculty staff and students as

168
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
well as people from industry and by

169
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,280
industrymeaning.com.milan.gov

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560

honor to be able to introduce you to the

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
founder of sirius professor eugene h

207
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,520
spafford uh spaff as is usually known as

208
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
is universally known within the industry

209
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
uh started sirius in 1998 but before

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
that he started the coast laboratory in

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
uh in 1992

212
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
30 years ago this year he started the

213
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
first security laboratory at purdue

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
university we have a number of our coast

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,319
alumni who are with us as well as

216
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
serious alumni who are with us today

217
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
so if you get it a chance because coast

218
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
predated me at purdue please make sure

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,599
that i have an opportunity to meet you

220
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
and hear some of the old stories that

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
you had but spaff started this with a

222
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
vision of making sure that cyber

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,760
security was looked at as an

224
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,440
interdisciplinary perspective it was not

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,279
just computer science

226
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,040
so the coast laboratory was computer

227
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,360
science and then sirius was started six

228
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,959
years later with the idea that this was

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,360
not going to be solved by just computer

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
scientists

231
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,800
and so if you look at the agenda today

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
those that we have brought from industry

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
as well as those from purdue who will be

234
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
speaking you'll see they come from five

235
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
different academic departments and

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
multiple focuses across

237
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
industry so i'm very pleased that we 23

238
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
years later

239
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
30 years later from coast are holding

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
true to that interdisciplinary nature

241
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
little bit of context uh for this

258
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,839
uh when i started

259
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
with sam the the coast laboratory back

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,760
in 92

261
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
there were a number of companies that

262
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,279
were involved that were supportive of

263
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
what we were doing

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
and in about 1995-96

265
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,000
one of the companies that we

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,839
enlisted in our efforts was

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
cisco uh cisco was a supporter first of

268
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
the coz lab and then when

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,480
syria started in may of 1998

270
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,120
they became one of our founding sponsors

271
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
so we have a long history with cisco and

272
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
we're we're delighted to have a speaker

273
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,279
from cisco here uh in in a little bit of

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,200
celebration of that

275
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,760
uh but in particular

276
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
we had a number of events over the first

277
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
few years well every year we have a

278
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
number of events but back then we had a

279
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
couple workshops

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
looking at the future of cyber security

281
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
to do some predictions and to do some

282
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
looking ahead

283
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,959
one of those was sponsored by accenture

284
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,360
and it was a workshop where we decided

285
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
we were going to invite visionaries

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,160
people with some idea of where we were

287
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
headed

288
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
and in particular we asked for some

289
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
visionaries from some of our partner

290
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
organizations

291
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
uh cisco provided

292
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,360
uh a visionary a cryptographer that had

293
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
recently joined the company from trusted

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,519
information systems as where you were

295
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,560
and

296
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,959

297
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
from 2001

298
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760

299
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,639

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,639
back

320

22 years

321

and a history in the field that goes

322
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
back much longer than that

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
he is a well-known cryptographer and

324
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519

one of the things he's best known for

333
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,839
is his

334
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
invention of the galwa counter mode for

335
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
stream encryption

336
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839

the program

339
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
doesn't really do justice

340
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
to

341
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
all that he has done

342
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,800
and with that

343
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
i would like to introduce

344
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,639
our speaker

345
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,639
dr david mcgrew of cisco where he will

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,639
continue to enlighten us and share with

347
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,800
us his views on cyber security david

348
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,070
thank you so much thank you very much

349
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,919
[Applause]

350
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
can you hear me

351
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
great

352
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
i think they hear just you once

353
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
hear me just once all right perfect

354
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,639
so i'm going to be talking today about

355
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,120
network security in a zero trust world i

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,639
want to share my my thoughts on this

357
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,920
subject

358
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
you know when i when i was first invited

359
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
i i set some very high goals for myself

360
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
i wanted to connect with people i wanted

361
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
to inspire you i was hoping to challenge

362
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
your thinking but after hearing about

363
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,279
the academy awards event right i'm

364
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,959
thinking if nobody jumps up and hits me

365
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,439
i'm good

366
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
so

367
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,839
you staff thank you very much for the

368
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,440
kind introduction

369
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,760
uh i have a a varied background so just

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,839
to you know explain myself a little bit

371
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
i like to think of myself as you know

372
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
being in that sweet spot in between

373
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,000
theory and practice where i get to um i

374
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
am involved in research but i'm also um

375
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
you know even more deeply involved in

376
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
uh you know designing uh implementing

377
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
operating products engaging with

378
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,800
customers all the things in practice

379
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
on the practice side i've worked very

380
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
closely with some uh incident response

381
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
and security monitoring teams and i'm

382
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
very passionate about you know actually

383
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
empowering those people

384
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
um

385
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,199
and then on the on the personal side uh

386
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,839
i love linux and jazz and sports cars

387
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,360
so here's the thesis for my presentation

388
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,959
today

389
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,079
network

390
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,639
encryption is eroding

391
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
visibility into indicators of compromise

392
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,600
in a way that i think

393
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
you know should be

394
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
on everybody's mind

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
at the same time encryption is

396
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
absolutely essential

397
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
to zero trust architectures right when

398
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,519
you look at zero trust

399
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,880
you need encryption all over your

400
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
network

401
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
so you know these two trends are coming

402
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,360
together

403
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
and making network security evolve right

404
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,959
so that

405
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,480
network security functionality is

406
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
increasingly being distributed

407
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,959
um on endpoints as well as networks

408
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,320
right so endpoints and networks need to

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
work together to actually deliver the

410
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,560
you know outcomes we want from network

411
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
security

412
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,199
and

413
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
network-based security you know here i'm

414
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
making a distinction of you know you

415
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,199
know network devices or network

416
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,880
monitoring is actually delivering it not

417
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
a host-based thing needs to monitor and

418
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,079
protect

419
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,720
the implicit trust zone right so that's

420
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
a zta thing that i'll i'll talk about

421
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
right so

422
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
this is my thesis and

423
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,959
uh feel free to ask a question or you

424
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,480
know if it's short in the middle of the

425
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
talk

426
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
otherwise i'll hopefully save some time

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
for uh discussion at the end

428
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,399
so

429
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
let's start off with a discussion of

430
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
visibility and encryption

431
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
and i want to motivate this first

432
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,079
this is

433
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,759
a table showing

434
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
indicators of compromise

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,760
from cisa

436
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
for the basically the first couple of

437
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,359
weeks right it was a data set i had

438
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,919
available so i categorized these by

439
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
indicator types

440
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
and counted the fraction of the

441
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
different types

442
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,400
of iocs right so these are you know

443
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
iocs that people thought were worth

444
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
sharing through cisa

445
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,760
and if you count up the fraction of

446
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
network-based iocs ipwatchlist and

447
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
domain watchlist those are the ones i

448
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
really want to focus on

449
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
they constitute

450
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
about 77

451
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
of all indicators of compromise

452
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,600
and

453
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
so i'm going to be presenting some very

454
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,160
technical detailed slides showing like

455
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
how these iocs are going away are

456
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
becoming harder to get or less

457
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,640
trustworthy so i think that's uh

458
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
so this is the motivation for why we

459
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
should care about all those dry boring

460
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
technical slides that are about to come

461
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,919
up

462
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,240
so

463
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,120
this

464
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,640
slide shows

465
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
data features

466
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,559
that are used in indicators of

467
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
compromise right so there's several

468
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
protocols i'm listing here a domain name

469
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,760
system which is used to map

470
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
a domain name to an address

471
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,799
the tls and quick protocol right tls is

472
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,919
the

473
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,679
long-standing um

474
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,200
you know transport layer security

475
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
protocol which you know we all rely on

476
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
probably even when we don't realize it

477
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,880
it's uh it's nearly ubiquitous today and

478
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,400
then quick is

479
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,799
a protocol that is replacing it it's

480
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,919
kind of a

481
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
more modern take on

482
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
uh both tcp and tls and then ip of

483
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
course is the the underlying protocol

484
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
that actually moves packets from you

485
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
know your network to somebody else's

486
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
network

487
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,240
so

488
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
i've listed some of these features here

489
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
and tied them into the watch lists you

490
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
can see the

491
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
the little daggers indicate you know if

492
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
they're associated with an ip watch list

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
or domain watch list

494
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,960
and so for dns the host name

495
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
which is relied on for

496
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
visibility and control by

497
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
i think most enterprises

498
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
so that's something that goes away due

499
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
to dns over https or dns over quick

500
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,600
right so that's doh or doq

501
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
and

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
um

503
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
there really is doq out there

504
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
uh and there's plenty of dns over https

505
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,720
um today it's baked into uh several

506
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
applications from

507
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,799
uh apple

508
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,640
um

509
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
facebook and you know other companies

510
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
google has an implementation microsoft

511
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
does i think we've seen all the their uh

512
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,640
quick traffic

513
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,559
and quick is something that has been

514
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,240
adopted by many of the web scale

515
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
companies um but then again the rest of

516
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
the world seems to be sticking with tls

517
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
so far

518
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
but tls and

519
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
quick

520
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
encrypt the

521
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,919
client hello server name which is

522
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,360
basically a hostname it's the same as

523
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
the dns hostname except it appears in a

524
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,320
tls client hello

525
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
so that's actually present and you can

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,679
use that

527
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,280
when

528
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
doh is used

529
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
there is a standards proposal it's not

530
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
yet a standard it's a draft for

531
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,159
encrypted client hello which would make

532
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,960
the client hello server name go away

533
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,799
and tls certificates contain

534
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,120
similar information to the host names

535
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
in the

536
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
and so you know certificates are visible

537
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
in network traffic for tls version 1.2

538
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
and previous but tls 1.3 is encrypting

539
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,559
them

540
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,919
there is a way

541
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
you know to obtain that information i'll

542
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
talk about it in a little bit a way to

543
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
obtain the information for 1.3

544
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
and there's some other information that

545
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
actually doesn't show up in in

546
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
indicators of compromised lists the

547
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
application layer protocol

548
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,720
which is an indication of what client

549
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
wants to do over tls

550
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
and usually it's http

551
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
but very often it's not for example

552
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,679
they're smb right smb quick is now

553
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,440
something that

554
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,799
is real and you can

555
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
observe that if you're paying attention

556
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
to

557
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,520
the application there protocol field

558
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
which probably we should pay more

559
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,919
attention to it

560
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,000
and it would go away that field would be

561
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
encrypted and kind of removed from

562
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
visibility uh again by the ech

563
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
proposal encrypted client hello

564
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
one data feature that doesn't go away

565
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
due to encryption is a network protocol

566
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
fingerprint right it is possible to come

567
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,039
up with a detailed fingerprint

568
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,360
of a client hello and encryption doesn't

569
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
make that go away including encrypted

570
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,080
client hello doesn't make it go away

571
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,679
i'll talk a little bit more about

572
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,200
fingerprinting at the very end of the

573
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
talk

574
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
and and lastly you know if you're using

575
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,960
ip addresses in a

576
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
indicator of compromise you need to pay

577
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,799
attention to the fact that i watch lists

578
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
um that ipwatchlist information isn't

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
going to do any good if in your

580
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
environment the environment that you're

581
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
monitoring there are there's vpn traffic

582
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,640
or proxy traffic right so there's things

583
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,679
like tor

584
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
and all sorts of

585
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
uh commercial products that you know

586
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,039
claim to do something even better than

587
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,840
tor

588
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,480
and so they'll encrypt your traffic and

589
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,799
send it up to some place where you know

590
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,559
they can see it but

591
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,520
um

592
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
you the person trying to monitor the

593
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,440
network uh i can't see it

594
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
so

595
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,080
um

596
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
apologies for rushing rather quickly

597
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
through a different set of technologies

598
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
i will talk a little bit more in detail

599
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,799
about the like the visibility features

600
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,840
and how we can recover some visibility

601
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
but the really key thing for me here is

602
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
that the

603
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
the data

604
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
published as indicators of compromise

605
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,919
we're losing visibility into it or we

606
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
need to change the way we have to go get

607
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,320
that visibility

608
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
so

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
to to talk about the the protocols in a

610
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,200
little bit more detail

611
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
i wanted to start out with an example of

612
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
say we've got a factory floor and we've

613
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,158
got an industrial robot that needs to

614
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,559
upgrade its operating system or maybe it

615
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,200
needs to download a user manual to make

616
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
you know provide that to a worker on the

617
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,960
floor or something like that it needs to

618
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,279
make a connection out to an https server

619
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,480
on the internet

620
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
so

621
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
within the factory so this is the

622
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
conventional ladder diagram right if you

623
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
don't work with protocols right this is

624
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
you know the different entities are at

625
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
the top and then time progresses at the

626
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
bottom and the the the data being sent

627
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
from one device to the other is

628
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
illustrated with the boxes and arrows

629
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,960
and

630
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
so

631
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
our the first thing our robot does is it

632
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
sends out a dns request

633
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
for this the name of the server it wants

634
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,039
to talk to

635
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,080
and

636
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
you know conventionally the the

637
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,480
enterprise would provide dns services

638
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
and they would provide them to the they

639
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,320
would tell the robot you know what what

640
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
the ip address was and then the the

641
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,279
robot would send out a client hello

642
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,679
would initiate a tls connection

643
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
and you know with convention with tls

644
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,120
1.2

645
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
and

646
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
i guess even 1.3 all this stuff is is

647
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,520
not encrypted um but of course the

648
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,840
actual http communication between the

649
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,159
robot and the web server is going to be

650
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,919
encrypted right so this is kind of like

651
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,440
most of the

652
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
uh https on the internet it looks like

653
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,679
this

654
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,799
then

655
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,919
how does dns over https change things

656
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,919
right so

657
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,600
there are some real positive benefits to

658
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,440
running dns over https that

659
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
um they encrypt the the dns traffic and

660
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
they authenticate the the dns server

661
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
which are very positive things that that

662
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,480
we should want but then

663
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,600
the the

664
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,720
big

665
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
and to explain you know the on the

666
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
diagram here

667
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
so when our robot makes this dns request

668
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
it's going out to a doh service dns over

669
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,440
https service

670
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,240
and whatever it's requesting is whenever

671
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,960
the address is being requested is

672
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
the request is going to go to the doh

673
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
provider

674
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
and if that's

675
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,799
an enterprise run system or like a

676
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,240
third-party security service that's

677
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
actually monitoring and you know using

678
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
the dns information for visibility and

679
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,919
control you're golden right because

680
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,520
you've just improved the security the

681
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,320
overall system however

682
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
um

683
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,000
you know if you're just letting your

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,720
software use any doh provider out there

685
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,799
on the internet you've just lost

686
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,440
visibility and and you've lost a control

687
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,320
point

688
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
and

689
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,480
so

690
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
for this reason you know

691
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,120
doh is great as long as you you can

692
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
trust your provider

693
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,880
there's there's another thing called dns

694
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
domain fronting

695
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
or domain faking and

696
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,840
so here we're back to our regular dns

697
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
system

698
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,600
and the the interesting thing to note is

699
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
that

700
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
in the tls server name our client is

701
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,039
saying i want to go to example.com

702
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,480
but

703
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
in the actual http request is saying no

704
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,799
i want to go to bogus.com right so we

705
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
see we've got a separate http server

706
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
called bogus.com so

707
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,919
the

708
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,200
most

709
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
web providers will not

710
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
allow domain fronting

711
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,600
and it's due to you know network

712
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
defenders telling

713
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
the the the big cloud scale companies we

714
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
don't want you to do domain fronting

715
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
because that makes it impossible for us

716
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,480
to

717
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,799
uh because the loss of visibility here

718
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,640
would be unacceptable so you know

719
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
cloudflare you know used to support

720
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,720
domain funding they backed away from it

721
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,840
and

722
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
fastly i think is the biggest provider

723
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
that actually supports domain funding

724
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
nowadays some cloud providers support

725
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,080
domain funding and they don't realize it

726
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,799
right so this has happened where uh you

727
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,039
know like tor used uh

728
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,240
microsoft

729
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,080
as uh microsoft azure and they you know

730
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,679
my audio didn't realize they supported

731
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
domain fronting but the tour people

732
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
figured out how to make it work so

733
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,600
um

734
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
domain fronting is another example of

735
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,559
how loss of visibility can happen

736
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,320
so

737
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,679
let's talk a little bit about the

738
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,120
certificates right because certificates

739
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,559
are wonderful information right when

740
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
you're asking the question like

741
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,399
you know but on on the system i'm trying

742
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,520
to protect right there are all these

743
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,640
encrypted connections who are they

744
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,559
talking to the first thing you should

745
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,559
think about maybe is like what are the

746
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,919
certificates associated with those

747
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,880
endpoints right so with tls 1.2 and

748
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
previous versions you could just watch

749
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,520
the network and the entire certificate

750
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,159
would be there right in the server's

751
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,000
response in the handshake right so it

752
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
would look just like this right so here

753
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,399
i'm focusing on the subject adult name

754
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,679
you know there's other information in

755
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,520
the certificate that's useful

756
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,559
but it's essentially the same

757
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
information that you get from say you

758
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600
know

759
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
passive dns monitoring or something like

760
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
that

761
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
so that's for tls 1.2 for 1.3

762
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,039
what happens is this information is

763
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
encrypted between the the server and the

764
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,120
client right so

765
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
you've lost your visibility into it

766
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,279
there is a way to recover visibility

767
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,559
which would be

768
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
uh having a triggered scan

769
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,000
right so you

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
we observed that

771
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,799
the client hello went out

772
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
going to this tls server

773
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
and there was no server name so

774
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,279
we'll send ourselves uh our own client

775
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,880
hello you know i've used a different

776
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
color to highlight the fact that it's a

777
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,320
different client hello an entirely

778
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
different session but we're mimicking

779
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,919
exactly the client hello that was being

780
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:16,720
sent

781
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,600
and we get the the response certificate

782
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
which is encrypted but you know it's in

783
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
our session so we know the data and then

784
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,440
we cache the data and so we essentially

785
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
build up a map of oh here are the

786
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
certificates associated with the servers

787
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,880
that the people i'm trying to defend are

788
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
talking to

789
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,399
right so um

790
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
you know at cisco we call this

791
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,799
server identity discovery i think is the

792
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
name for it right so

793
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,799
and and it works really well and

794
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
it's um

795
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
uh it's a good thing to do

796
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,159
because uh it goes a long way to

797
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,039
recovering uh lost visibility

798
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,279
so

799
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,520
um i don't have any pictures of quick

800
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,559
right because they would look just like

801
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
the tls picture so i didn't want to add

802
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,039
them

803
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
but let me speak a little bit too quick

804
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
the quick protocol really replaces both

805
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,360
tcp and tls and it includes some

806
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,559
components of tls but in a way that

807
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,840
um

808
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
you know doesn't actually it's hard to

809
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,039
get code reuse

810
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,120
between the tls implementation and a

811
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
quick implementation there's some but

812
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,440
not as much as you'd want

813
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
and

814
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,399
so quick has some performance benefits

815
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,799
it removes head of line blocking and and

816
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,840
it also you know quick is designed to

817
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,679
um get around network access controls

818
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,960
and traditional operating system

819
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
controls right because quick is

820
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
something you can implement in you know

821
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,039
in user space not in the kernel right so

822
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,960
the the the people designing quick

823
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,799
wanted to maximize their performance and

824
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,080
work around any existing uh

825
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,679
you know operating systems or networks

826
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,360
really interesting thing with kwik is

827
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
the initial handshake packets are

828
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,399
encrypted

829
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,279
using

830
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,760
uh a fixed key like if you can imagine

831
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
like putting a key in into an internet

832
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,240
rfc and everybody uses that key and

833
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,399
which means that we all have extra key

834
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,399
derivation and encryption steps to

835
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
perform um believe it or not they

836
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,919
actually derive two keys uh

837
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
and and then do this uh

838
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
decryption of the headers and they have

839
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
distinct keys for client direct you know

840
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,720
client send and server send directions

841
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,919
so there's there's a lot of key

842
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,720
derivation going on with quick and

843
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
um

844
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
it's something that's definitely an

845
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,279
impact on the the scale of

846
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,279
the clients and servers and also

847
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,039
in a monitoring situation you need to do

848
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,440
this one thing that really surprises me

849
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,279
about quick is

850
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,799
the keys are not registered with the

851
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,200
internet assigned numbers authority

852
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,519
right so in the traditional internet you

853
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,200
know people who wrote rfcs expect that

854
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,720
i'm writing an rfc so that anybody in

855
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
the world can interoperate with

856
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
something it's actually hard to track

857
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,279
down the quick keys if you actually want

858
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
to know the quick keys associated with

859
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,799
every distinct version of quick

860
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,720
that it takes a lot of uh you know a

861
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
little bit of reverse engineering and

862
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
some sleuthing to actually get them all

863
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,399
so

864
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,120
the the quick authors uh didn't make it

865
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,640
easy to monitor quick and it's pretty um

866
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
radical departure from

867
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,559
the the way the internet was 20 years

868
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,840
ago

869
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,000
um application layer protocols are also

870
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
not registered with the internet

871
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
assigned numbers authority

872
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,039
so

873
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
you know the you know like with tls

874
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,399
when a client talks to a server it can

875
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,840
say i want to do

876
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,720
um

877
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
speedy or i want to do http 2 or

878
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,159
something like that right that's what

879
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,760
the application there protocol is in

880
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,440
quick they've made it so that you don't

881
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,760
have to register those right so quick is

882
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,399
designed to be a framework for uh people

883
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,640
developing their own

884
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
uh

885
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,399
you know

886
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,159
encrypted transport protocols

887
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,760
essentially

888
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
and something interesting about quick

889
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,039
right if you're doing network traffic

890
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,159
analysis

891
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:58,960
there

892
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,399
some quick implementations randomize

893
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,960
the order in which extensions appear

894
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
appear right so the

895
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
there's a list of extensions and like

896
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,679
most protocols right the client can

897
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,000
propose a list of things it wants to do

898
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,559
and uh there's randomization that goes

899
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,720
on i think in an attempt to make

900
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,799
fingerprinting harder to do although

901
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,080
fingerprinting is still pretty effective

902
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,159
against quick

903
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,039
so

904
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,720
um quick is is very interesting

905
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,760
and

906
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
um at this point you know i'll tell you

907
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
how i feel is like i feel like i'm

908
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
playing visibility bingo right which is

909
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
like there's all these different data

910
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,960
features and you know my hope is like

911
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,279
each each indicator of compromise i have

912
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,960
at least one way to observe it right you

913
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
know so

914
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
um

915
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
but there are some i think sensible

916
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,919
mitigations and so i want to you know

917
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,760
make clear that

918
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,360
so these mitigations that i'm talking

919
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,600
about to regain visibility these are

920
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,720
would be appropriate when you're

921
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
defending an enterprise network right

922
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
i'm they absolutely would be

923
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,159
inappropriate like if you're an internet

924
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,760
service provider or if you're monitoring

925
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,039
the public internet or something like

926
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,960
that right so i'll talk a little bit

927
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
about privacy later but just to be clear

928
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:12,960
you know when you're when you're

929
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,760
defending a network

930
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,399
these mitigations would be good for

931
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
retaining visibility for a domain name

932
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,839
watch list right

933
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,239
you should use an enterprise

934
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,480
sanctioned doh provider right in other

935
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
words you know there's

936
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
use doh but make sure that it's all

937
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,839
connected to

938
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,960
a service that actually is doing you

939
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,679
know

940
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
visibility and control there

941
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
and then there's

942
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,719
another thing you have to do

943
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,800
unfortunately which is you need to block

944
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,639
unsanctioned doh

945
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,520
and uh dns over quick and and also

946
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,280
unsanctioned dns right because i think

947
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,079
in in some networks um you can run dns

948
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,359
over tcp

949
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,680
and and that's accepted or maybe even

950
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
they're they're not blocking dns to you

951
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
know like because quad 8 is really

952
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,839
popular right you know it's a good

953
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,359
backup to have

954
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,560
but you need to at least be paying

955
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,359
attention to unsanctioned use of

956
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,560
um

957
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,320
these other you know dns providers

958
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
and as far as tls rate i talked about

959
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,599
like a way to get a triggered scan to

960
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,359
get certificates

961
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,400
that's a good way to get visibility into

962
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,160
the

963
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,599
server names

964
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,720
and

965
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,880
you can block domain fronting right it's

966
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
actually there's a small number of

967
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
places on the internet that support

968
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
domain fronting there's domain faking

969
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,440
thing can go on in any cloud provider

970
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
where somebody can stand up

971
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,000
their own tls server

972
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,880
but

973
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
it is possible to detect and block

974
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
domain fronting

975
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,720
so for an ip watch list

976
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,079
to defend a network you're going to want

977
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,240
to block this unsanctioned lens like you

978
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
don't want tor running in your data

979
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
center or your secure environment right

980
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,160
which isn't to say that tor doesn't have

981
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,119
you know

982
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,200
let me say it positively right tor has

983
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,240
really good uses allowing people in

984
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,040
uh

985
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,440
in repressive regimes to you know access

986
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
the real internet which is a wonderful

987
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
incredible positive but that that

988
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
doesn't change like it doesn't make tor

989
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
all of a sudden good to run in your

990
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,119
secure enclave right you know that's uh

991
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,400
a different thing so you need to be able

992
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
to detect and block that sort of thing

993
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,599
and

994
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,720
and the last point is host based network

995
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,800
activity monitoring by which i mean you

996
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
can look for all of these iocs on an

997
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,400
endpoint in other words you sit on the

998
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
endpoint and and watch this network

999
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,079
activity there's a bunch of commercial

1000
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,520
products that do that

1001
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,079
and uh it's an obvious trend

1002
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,520
that a positive trend

1003
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,599
and

1004
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,200
uh it's also hard there's a lot of

1005
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,680
challenges right so the

1006
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
if if there's a software application

1007
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,119
that has embedded in it a hard-coded

1008
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,320
address of a doh provider it's going to

1009
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,480
reach out to that thing unless you block

1010
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,079
it on your network or or on the host

1011
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,440
right the host could detect oh wait a

1012
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,000
minute this is the doh unsanctioned doh

1013
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
that's being reached out to right but

1014
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,520
the point is that even when you're doing

1015
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,359
host-based network

1016
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,960
monitoring

1017
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
you're still going to have to pay

1018
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,480
attention to these these evasions right

1019
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
it's not like a slam dunk there

1020
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,480
so that's a lot of information

1021
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,760
i hope it came through and

1022
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
if not you know please ask questions

1023
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,200
so it's really important to state

1024
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,960
um

1025
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
people deserve privacy malware does not

1026
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,520
right which is you know one of the this

1027
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,359
is like a mantra for us inside cisco

1028
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,560
right because we do a lot of network

1029
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,720
security monitoring and you know i

1030
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,320
sometimes get questions from you know

1031
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,640
well-meaning but uninformed people who

1032
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
don't understand the difference between

1033
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,079
like uh

1034
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,359
you know like a network switch and a

1035
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,280
data center and an internet service

1036
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
provider right but it's different

1037
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
equipment different use cases

1038
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,760
um

1039
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
so

1040
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,599
before i get on to talking about

1041
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,200
zero trust architectures which is you

1042
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,320
know like probably what you were hoping

1043
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
i'd be talking about

1044
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
let me just spend a little time on the

1045
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,800
privacy issues right so

1046
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,839
you know

1047
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,119
i would say

1048
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
that it's a false dichotomy to say that

1049
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
you have to have privacy or you have to

1050
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
have security to say they're exclusive

1051
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,280
is a false dichotomy right so

1052
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,200
privacy is a human right

1053
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,160
and

1054
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
um defending a data center and

1055
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,240
defending a server that contains

1056
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
somebody's personal information you're

1057
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
defending privacy that way right so

1058
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,839
that's how i view it

1059
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,200
you know

1060
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
to get real privacy in the scenario you

1061
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
need real security

1062
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,079
and

1063
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,160
indicator of compromise visibility does

1064
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,240
not require us to like you know run

1065
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,560
everybody's tls connection to a proxy so

1066
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
that we can scan all their their files

1067
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
or something like that right all the

1068
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
visibility i'm talking about here uh you

1069
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,000
know requires some you know some

1070
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,320
attention but you know we're not like

1071
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
both decrypting somebody's traffic

1072
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,960
and a really important point to lead

1073
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
into the zero trust

1074
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,920
part of the talk

1075
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,800
privacy considerations do not apply to a

1076
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,960
huge fraction of the encrypted

1077
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,920
connections on the internet today right

1078
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
they don't apply to machine to machine

1079
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
communication or all sorts of automation

1080
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
or all these cases where you know

1081
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,520
somebody has a process that's reaching

1082
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,640
out over a rest api over https and

1083
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
they're oh we're going to download the

1084
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
data every day right knowing that that's

1085
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
part of your critical infrastructure

1086
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,599
is

1087
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,359
is really good and doesn't violate

1088
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,839
anybody's privacy to like know what that

1089
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
what's going on inside that encrypted

1090
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,520
connection and the iot space is of

1091
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,160
course really huge here right that

1092
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,839
you know my thermostat doesn't deserve

1093
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,440
privacy as far as i'm concerned

1094
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,839
so

1095
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,280
now i'm so i think i'm like halfway

1096
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
through my talk and i finally got into

1097
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
the zero trust part

1098
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
so

1099
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,599
i have uh

1100
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,520
so here's my definition of zero trust

1101
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,640
right and

1102
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,599
i'm

1103
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,960
heavily indebted to this nist zero trust

1104
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,599
architecture special publication that

1105
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,319
came out i guess two years ago now

1106
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,960
and uh it's a good document i really

1107
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
appreciate it for being you know vendor

1108
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,720
neutral

1109
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
so in a zero trust world

1110
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,359
trust is never granted implicitly

1111
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,920
and it has to be continuously evaluated

1112
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,240
right so this is kind of like you know

1113
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
when we were you know back in the 90s

1114
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,760
like staff was talking about you know

1115
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,359
the we're imagining wow we could use

1116
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,960
cryptography we could actually secure

1117
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
all these connections right this is just

1118
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
what we wanted right was that we can

1119
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
authenticate who we're talking to

1120
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,680
um

1121
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,200
most of this traffic in the zero trust

1122
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,880
world is encrypted

1123
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
and of course in the world we've got a

1124
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
heterogeneous mix we've got enterprise

1125
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,200
managed devices and then we also have to

1126
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,880
deal with unmanaged devices and there's

1127
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,839
going to be non-enterprise assets there

1128
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,800
and

1129
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
you know we've got a lot of

1130
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,599
mission-critical connections right from

1131
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,839
like our devices out to you know like a

1132
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,400
partner's device or something like that

1133
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,079
um

1134
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
so the xero trust world is i mean it's

1135
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,200
really cool if we can actually like

1136
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,440
authenticate who we're talking to and

1137
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,839
you know we should do that where we can

1138
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,640
but

1139
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,720
in in the zero trust architecture they

1140
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,079
have something called the implicit trust

1141
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
zone

1142
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,359
right the implicit trust zone is all

1143
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,119
those places where you can't actually

1144
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,280
authenticate you know who you're talking

1145
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,880
to and

1146
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
so

1147
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,440
um

1148
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,880
you know it's basic basically in the

1149
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
zero trust architecture the the implicit

1150
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,119
trust zone is an admission that

1151
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,880
there's going to be a lot of devices and

1152
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
a lot of software and a bunch of users

1153
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,720
and a bunch of providers right you know

1154
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
i can't really verify that i trust them

1155
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,319
right so this is what we call the

1156
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,319
implicit trust zone and

1157
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,680
sometimes it can be very large

1158
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,000
especially as an organization

1159
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,160
um you know moves to zero trust

1160
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
architecture it's not gonna get there

1161
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
overnight you know it might get there

1162
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
over a decade

1163
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,680
and

1164
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,920
and so the implicit

1165
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
um could include things like uh

1166
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,640
unmanaged systems like your guest os or

1167
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,040
containers which like

1168
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,359
is it really feasible to deploy

1169
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,599
um you know host monitoring in all your

1170
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,200
docker containers you know that that

1171
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
would be awesome if you could

1172
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,800
um

1173
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
you know same goes for

1174
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
virtual machine guest os's

1175
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,480
you know a lot of organizations have

1176
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
development or test machines that are

1177
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,040
run by some group other than its because

1178
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,200
they have some you know requirements to

1179
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
run whatever software and hardware

1180
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,359
there's out of policy devices right you

1181
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,359
have all these legacy devices that like

1182
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,200
okay well you know we paid a lot of

1183
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,720
money for it we're going to use it until

1184
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
the warranty expires and then you have

1185
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
like people install workarounds right

1186
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,520
you know it's like well i just bought

1187
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
this nat off of ebay and that's going to

1188
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,200
really solve a problem in our lab

1189
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,319
and

1190
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,800
bring your own device the guest devices

1191
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
are you know in the implicit trust zone

1192
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,359
very often the physical infrastructure

1193
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,400
iot

1194
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,680
and ot

1195
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,839
and and then network infrastructure

1196
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,079
uh you know might be in this zone

1197
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,280
so

1198
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,920
you know zta is really cool i really

1199
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
honestly think it's a good thing but i

1200
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,760
want to focus on the implicit trust zone

1201
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,680
which is kind of like okay this is the

1202
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,319
part of our architecture that's not yet

1203
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,680
up to speed

1204
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,599
and the really key point here is at the

1205
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,200
bottom right in a zero trust

1206
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,520
architecture we do not trust the network

1207
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
but at the same time

1208
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
we need to do everything we can to deny

1209
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
to the threat actors the ability to

1210
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,640
operate an environment

1211
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,079
and this is a really key point right

1212
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,280
because a lot of people talking about

1213
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,839
zta will focus on like all the cool

1214
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,359
stuff we can do when we can authenticate

1215
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,319
somebody so well okay that's super but

1216
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,839
what about the implicit trust zone which

1217
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,800
is like 70 of your devices

1218
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,599
and

1219
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,200
so

1220
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,560
um so here's a graphic you know

1221
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,400
you know it's kind of a word salad on on

1222
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,839
the last slide right hopefully this

1223
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,760
illustrates it a little bit

1224
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,599
i'm trying to show here we've got a

1225
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,440
factory we've got an office and we've

1226
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,839
got a home network and like a mobile

1227
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,040
network

1228
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,440
and then we've got like enterprise cloud

1229
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,280
we've got third-party clouds and then

1230
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,200
we've got the the web

1231
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,040
and we have you know some enterprise

1232
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,720
devices some managed devices some

1233
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,040
unmanaged devices and all these things

1234
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,240
are going to be communicating right

1235
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
there's going to be you know connections

1236
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,040
all over it you know it's a nearly

1237
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
complete graph

1238
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,200
or or it's not a sparse graph if you

1239
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,720
were to plot out the communication

1240
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,319
between these things right and we're

1241
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,160
going to rely on security

1242
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,960
and we're going to need encryption

1243
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
yet we're not going to actually be able

1244
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
to rely on

1245
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
um

1246
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,160
you know the zero trust architecture so

1247
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,520
we're going to have to worry about the

1248
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,599
implicit trust zone here right so this

1249
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,319
is

1250
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,319
um

1251
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,240
you know i was talking about visibility

1252
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
because we're now going to need to use

1253
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,599
it to secure our implicit trust zone

1254
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,400
so as far as network security goes here

1255
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,000
like i said before we want to use host

1256
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,640
based software to monitor network

1257
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,119
activity wherever we can right so if we

1258
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,640
can install a software agent on an

1259
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,359
endpoint and it's able to monitor the

1260
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,960
activity and and get those those

1261
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,480
indicators of compromise and do like

1262
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
behavioral monitoring that's super we

1263
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,760
should do that

1264
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
um

1265
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,800
but then there's gonna be a lot of

1266
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,400
places where we can't

1267
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,839
actually install

1268
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,160
the that agent or we can't get the

1269
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,839
telemetry off it the way we want you

1270
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,960
know in the real world um you can try

1271
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,800
even if you're you know it's even if

1272
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
it's a priority to run host-based

1273
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,319
monitoring network-based monitoring is

1274
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,240
often the best you have

1275
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,960
so

1276
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,560
you know network-based visibility and

1277
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
control is going to be everywhere else

1278
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,400
and especially in this implicit trust

1279
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,720
zone

1280
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,040
so let me

1281
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,119
move right on to that right so

1282
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,680
here i am channeling again this special

1283
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
publication

1284
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,880
right because

1285
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,960
it's really interesting how you can take

1286
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,480
this like

1287
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
network visibility ideas and map them

1288
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,000
onto

1289
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,160
the the xero trust architecture and how

1290
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,000
it talks about

1291
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the need to manage the devices in the

1292
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,079
implicit trust zone so we need to

1293
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
identify all of the devices that are

1294
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,359
actually in this trust zone and if you

1295
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,800
work in a large enterprise actually

1296
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,319
defending it you might

1297
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,520
you probably know that like one of the

1298
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,960
hardest things of your job is to

1299
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,119
actually inventory every single bit of

1300
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,720
device every device and every bit of

1301
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
software and and every you know

1302
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
communication interaction right i mean

1303
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,520
that's

1304
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,599
that's huge so we need to identify these

1305
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,960
devices we need to track them over time

1306
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,880
we need to use network visibility to

1307
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
check for the indicators of compromise

1308
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,359
in the implicit trust zone

1309
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,359
we need to be able to detect devices in

1310
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,839
this zone that are out of policy

1311
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,839
and especially ones that are infected

1312
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,960
right so that they can be contained

1313
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,079
and

1314
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,960
um we need to identify uh insecure

1315
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,119
communication that's going on there

1316
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
and uh devices with a poor security

1317
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,359
posture i'm actually really excited

1318
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,720
about this one

1319
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,240
because

1320
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
when you're doing network monitoring one

1321
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,520
one of the things you can tell is like

1322
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,880
you know somebody's using a self-signed

1323
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,040
certificate somebody else is using rc4

1324
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
md5

1325
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
that that sort of thing is really easy

1326
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
to spot with network visibility

1327
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,839
and we need to

1328
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,119
detect scans or attempted logins in in

1329
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,200
the implicit trust zone the network

1330
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,280
visibility is the best thing for that

1331
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,960
and and the last point

1332
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
we need to integrate with apis that

1333
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
allow the enterprise to

1334
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,760
um

1335
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
understand

1336
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
you know programmatically right we want

1337
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,559
to programmatically integrate the

1338
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,640
network visibility into

1339
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,359
the zta right so this is a great point

1340
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,960
and i can't speak to that so much but i

1341
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,960
think it's a fantastic direction

1342
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,319
so

1343
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,079
most of what i've talked to you know up

1344
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,920
to this point has been an explanation of

1345
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,079
like why i'm working on what i'm working

1346
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,480
on and the next few slides are going to

1347
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,760
explain a little bit of what i am

1348
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,720
working on

1349
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,559
so

1350
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,280
um we can our best way to get visibility

1351
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,440
in into

1352
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,359
the things we need is through

1353
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,680
inferencing right identification of

1354
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,000
operating systems or devices

1355
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,079
client or server software and then

1356
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,000
identifying malware communication these

1357
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,079
are well studied problems in network

1358
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,319
protocol fingerprinting

1359
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,920
and you know very often when people say

1360
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,280
fingerprinting they're being a little

1361
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,520
bit um you know it's sometimes used in

1362
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,119
two ways sometimes a fingerprint means

1363
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,240
like

1364
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,160
like a byte string and sometimes

1365
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,640
fingerprinting is used to mean like i'm

1366
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,160
actually analyzing some behavior and

1367
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,760
applying some rules to it or maybe some

1368
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,359
machine learning to it

1369
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,599
and um

1370
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,839
so

1371
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,240
and

1372
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,040
both senses are perfectly good

1373
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,200
machine learning is very often the best

1374
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,400
way to

1375
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
uh frame these inferencing problems

1376
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,920
right so

1377
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,839
uh within the network security world

1378
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,440
right you have like paxon and summer's

1379
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,400
paper which is like 10 years old

1380
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,720
that speaks to the difficulty of

1381
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,640
applying machine learning in network

1382
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,119
analysis and and and i certainly think

1383
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,559
they have many valid points but in my

1384
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,839
experience when you're when you're

1385
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,599
actually analyzing something like you i

1386
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,119
want to identify is somebody running

1387
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,440
an unpatched you know windows 7 version

1388
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,119
or whatever there are fingerprinting

1389
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,720
techniques you can apply there that use

1390
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,079
simple and interpretable machine

1391
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,160
learning models right so

1392
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,599
in our work we've used a lot of naive

1393
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,839
bayes and we've used um a lot of

1394
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,520
logistic regression right these these

1395
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,680
are interpretable models and

1396
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,119
you know we're not throwing it into a

1397
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,520
neural net and and and then getting an

1398
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,200
answer that we can't tell you you know

1399
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,880
how the model got the answer but machine

1400
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,599
learning i think has a lot of value here

1401
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,440
and um

1402
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,079
one last plug here

1403
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,839
better data sharing would improve all of

1404
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,040
these solutions right so

1405
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
you know everybody trying to defend a

1406
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,040
network has

1407
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,440
to make decisions like you know

1408
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
is this is this device doing something

1409
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,880
that it shouldn't is this should this

1410
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,160
device be on my network what kind of

1411
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,520
device is that

1412
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
and

1413
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,359
so um you know big vendors can get

1414
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,119
data pretty easily

1415
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,040
and you know network defenders have a

1416
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,720
view of their own devices

1417
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,319
but the world would be such a better

1418
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,880
place if we could come up with ways to

1419
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,920
share data about um

1420
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
devices and about threats right so the

1421
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,079
um i

1422
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,079
this is an area where i think

1423
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,599
research could make a huge difference in

1424
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,559
the world and specifically uh privacy

1425
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,559
techniques that made that could solve

1426
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,280
these problems

1427
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,640
where

1428
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,160
organizations would be willing to share

1429
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,920
data because there was some mechanism

1430
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,839
that was protecting their privacy

1431
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,400
oh and i have a link down here to the

1432
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,480
naive bayes uh fingerprinting with

1433
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,400
destination contacts right so this is my

1434
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,079
contribution to this

1435
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,480
space

1436
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,960
so

1437
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,480
like kind of the foundation level when

1438
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,200
you're analyzing stuff on the network

1439
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,079
network protocol fingerprints right so

1440
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,720
uh we have an open source

1441
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,960
release that includes

1442
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,680
uh i've got a url to the specification

1443
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,040
here

1444
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,480
um

1445
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,240
the the open source project is called

1446
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
mercury at cisco we do a lot of

1447
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,160
different kinds of network traffic

1448
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,319
analysis and we've published this thing

1449
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,880
a fingerprinting system that can be

1450
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,000
applied to different protocols

1451
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,359
to explain network protocol

1452
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,720
fingerprinting you look at a packet that

1453
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,000
somebody sends

1454
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,200
and probably you're going to sift

1455
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,400
through it so like you're going to want

1456
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,559
to find a tls client hello for example

1457
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,160
and then you're going to select certain

1458
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,960
substrings from that packet like the the

1459
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,839
cipher suite offer and the extensions

1460
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,280
and then you're going to normalize that

1461
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
data the normalization step removes

1462
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,839
things that are session specific so

1463
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,920
what's left is just

1464
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,640
client specific right so

1465
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,400
here we have some examples

1466
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,880
of what fingerprints look like

1467
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,640
and uh there's tcp http tls and quick

1468
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
and so this is uh

1469
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
the interesting thing with the you know

1470
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,040
quick looks a lot like the other ones

1471
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,960
and

1472
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,880
uh but you know despite the fact that

1473
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,280
the this is i forget which fingerprint

1474
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,040
this is but you know the there was

1475
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,359
randomization that was used in uh by the

1476
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,480
client to try to um

1477
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,960
make fingerprinting harder

1478
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,800
so this is kind of like the foundation

1479
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
for all fingerprinting is this like

1480
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,559
string analysis you need to do in order

1481
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,119
to get the the data features and we have

1482
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,880
an open source contribution we'd love to

1483
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,280
have uh you know anyone interested in

1484
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,000
this

1485
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,960
um you know reach out to me or just uh

1486
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,040
open an issue on the on github

1487
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,119
but i think there's a

1488
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,800
a good opportunity around network

1489
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,200
protocol fingerprinting because

1490
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,720
it can be used in indicators of

1491
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,200
compromise and

1492
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,119
you know some indicators of compromise

1493
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,800
are shared

1494
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,119
with fingerprints i think that's

1495
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,200
a good direction to consider

1496
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,720
and

1497
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,079
so

1498
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,680
from my colleague blake anderson here's

1499
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,240
a confusion chart to show what accuracy

1500
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,440
you can get

1501
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,559
if you have an environment where you

1502
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,359
have good labels you can get a really

1503
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,119
good accuracy this is looking at a

1504
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,559
single tls client hello and estimating

1505
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,880
what client sent that client hello and

1506
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,920
so there's

1507
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,160
it's a confusion matrix right so if

1508
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,400
there's a one on the diagonal

1509
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,280
then

1510
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,599
we're perfect to you know two

1511
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,480
significant figures and if there's a

1512
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
lower number on the diagonal that means

1513
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,839
you know that we're mistaking something

1514
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,000
on the row oh i should explain we have

1515
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,760
the

1516
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,119
the true label

1517
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,400
is on the vertical

1518
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,240
and then the predicted label is on the

1519
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,240
horizontal right in other words

1520
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,280
so

1521
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
um an off-diagonal element means we

1522
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,319
guessed that

1523
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,040
we made an incorrect guess as to what

1524
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,440
process it was

1525
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,119
so you know this is a randomly chosen

1526
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,079
example

1527
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,839
to show that you can get really good

1528
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,040
accuracy if you have good labels

1529
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,160
so

1530
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,359
so i've talked a lot i i hope i made

1531
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,520
sense and i'm going to try to sum up

1532
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,559
with some conclusions

1533
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,520
so

1534
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,839
it seems really clear network security

1535
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,200
is evolving

1536
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,839
and the the loss of visibility is

1537
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,559
something we need to pay attention to

1538
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,119
and we need to distribute network

1539
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,880
security functionality so that it's

1540
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,960
sometimes network devices but also you

1541
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,280
know increasingly end host devices are

1542
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,960
actually looking for the iocs for us or

1543
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,880
they're doing the monitoring so network

1544
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,480
security is moving more to end hosts

1545
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,160
and we need the

1546
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,680
host monitoring and network monitoring

1547
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,160
to work together which you know some

1548
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,079
industry analysts would say okay that's

1549
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,720
xdr and i'm i'm perfectly good with that

1550
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,000
i'm a big fan of xdr um xdr is extended

1551
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,520
detection and response forester and

1552
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,440
gartner have different definitions of

1553
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,040
xdr range so

1554
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,920
um

1555
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,440
and frost and sullivan you know i'm not

1556
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,599
sure where they lie but anyway extended

1557
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,200
detection and response is a good way to

1558
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,200
analyze network and host data together

1559
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,799
um

1560
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,599
so network-based security

1561
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,280
we need it to monitor

1562
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,359
that implicit trust zone right and we

1563
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,119
need it to

1564
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,319
to to make sure that we have an

1565
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,559
integrated view that okay inside my xero

1566
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,799
trust architecture i'm talk you know i

1567
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,160
have this device that's talking to

1568
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,599
something in the implicit trust zone you

1569
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,280
know is that is it a good thing out

1570
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,280
there or is it something that's on the

1571
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,040
on the bad list because it's it's

1572
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,960
behaving strangely or i'm not sure it

1573
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,960
should actually be there

1574
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,599
and uh network protocol fingerprints

1575
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,680
could be a valuable addition to

1576
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,440
indicators of compromise because you

1577
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,400
know on the list of iocs right

1578
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,160
the fingerprints aren't going away due

1579
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,319
to any form of encryption

1580
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,680
and

1581
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,599
fingerprinting can be applied to

1582
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,599
all encrypted connections including vpn

1583
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,720
and including

1584
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,359
dns over https or

1585
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,079
dns over quick right so fingerprinting

1586
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,280
uh seems to be a good tool

1587
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
and and lastly i'd really love to see

1588
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,559
research right so i'm talking uh to a

1589
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,480
place with some brilliant researchers

1590
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,200
and

1591
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,040
uh people who can make an impact in the

1592
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,400
real world with their research so

1593
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,119
getting visibility

1594
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,640
to actually defend the information

1595
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,720
systems that we need to defend while at

1596
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
the same time not like weakening

1597
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,480
technologies that would in a way that

1598
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,400
would hurt privacy right i think this is

1599
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,319
a major challenge for our time

1600
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,400
and i think there's all sorts of

1601
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,760
different solutions that could be

1602
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,680
brought to bear here right so

1603
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,119
i you know i i hope i i motivate you to

1604
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,640
think about the problem and i would you

1605
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,480
know i hesitate to try to you know

1606
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,599
suggest an approach because i think

1607
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,799
there's many different approaches that

1608
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,319
could possibly work

1609
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,359
and

1610
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,160
um and i think it's a problem that that

1611
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,319
really deserves our some of our

1612
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,640
attention

1613
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,640
and

1614
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,400
so speaking of attention i want to thank

1615
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,000
you for your attention to my talk today

1616
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,799
i

1617
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,430
really appreciate the opportunity

1618
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:33,680
[Applause]

1619
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,440
yeah so

1620
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,799
we have time for questions are we going

1621
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,680
to use this microphone here

1622
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,359
so so what do you think

1623
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,920
does it make sense to you do you see uh

1624
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,680
something i missed maybe you have a

1625
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,960
different perspective on something

1626
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,599
david from

1627
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,920
david from your perspective

1628
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,760
what are you seeing that most industry

1629
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
who is trying to adopt zero trust

1630
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,440
architectures are getting it wrong

1631
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,280
what are the common mistakes that you

1632
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,520
see over and over again

1633
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,040
i'm not sure

1634
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,558
i can really speak to that

1635
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,640
because uh

1636
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,319
you can see where my thoughts are my

1637
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,359
thoughts are on the implicit trust zone

1638
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,119
um

1639
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:29,839
i

1640
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,240
my sense is that

1641
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,839
a lot of people adopting zero trust

1642
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,920
architectures might say something like

1643
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,799
well

1644
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,960
you know here here's i've got this data

1645
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,319
that's really important and it's on this

1646
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,359
device and i'm going to install a

1647
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,440
monitoring agent on that device

1648
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,359
and and that's kind of where the focus

1649
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,559
is like while i'm protecting the crown

1650
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,720
jewels and that's where my focus is

1651
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,760
and

1652
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,880
that's

1653
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,160
um

1654
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,839
that's good

1655
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,200
uh you know where it succeeds but

1656
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,520
in my experience the

1657
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,559
let's see

1658
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,480
there it would be really good to have

1659
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,599
some introspection i think introspection

1660
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,119
like

1661
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,680
like in the programming sense right

1662
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,839
or

1663
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,280
your monitoring system should be

1664
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,119
tracking how good a job it's actually

1665
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,640
doing is it actually monitoring the

1666
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,640
connections and in my experience right

1667
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,160
so if you actually do this like network

1668
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,359
monitoring and host monitoring and

1669
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,359
i work with some some customers

1670
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,119
including cisco who actually do this

1671
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,359
like try to monitor you know they have a

1672
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,200
set of devices they're monitoring

1673
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,720
and and then they're monitoring the

1674
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,920
network and then they actually bring all

1675
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,680
that data together and it's pretty

1676
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,000
revealing it's like well there's all

1677
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,440
these hosts that you know you thought

1678
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,960
you had the host monitoring working on

1679
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,400
but there's all this net your activity

1680
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,680
you see on the network side that you

1681
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,440
don't see on the host side

1682
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,799
so

1683
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,799
i think that's a

1684
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,480
we could do a lot better there right we

1685
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,599
should

1686
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
we should be finding a way to

1687
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,839
um

1688
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,599
do you know get visibility where we need

1689
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,599
it

1690
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,280
chris clifton uh from here at sirius you

1691
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,119
brought up something earlier about

1692
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,760
people deserve privacy but you know

1693
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,680
devices don't

1694
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,559
and

1695
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,000
i'm concerned that that's a very

1696
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,760
slippery slope i mean

1697
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,880
my thermostat may not deserve privacy

1698
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,760
but

1699
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,079
what about the data that my thermostat

1700
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,400
has saying i'm going to be gone for the

1701
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,720
next week

1702
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,480
you know how do we figure out

1703
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,520
when

1704
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,400
you know

1705
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,440
when information is

1706
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,760
something we shouldn't be disclosing and

1707
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,319
when it's some and and where's that line

1708
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,079
that that's a that's a really great

1709
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,000
point thank you chris

1710
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
yeah you're totally right

1711
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,200
that

1712
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,040
um so so actually what the slide said

1713
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,799
was like malware doesn't deserve privacy

1714
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,240
right so it's always good to have a

1715
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,520
statement there that you know nobody

1716
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,079
could disagree with right

1717
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,119
um

1718
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,319
but but you're absolutely right about

1719
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,559
the thermostat example and it's a

1720
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,319
non-trip thing right so i would say like

1721
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,280
if we're getting visibility into like so

1722
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,920
i forget kind of thermostat

1723
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,960
like a honeywell i think i have a

1724
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,319
honeywell right so it goes to

1725
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,839
honeywell.com or whatever right so i've

1726
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,119
actually monitored this i've looked at

1727
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,119
what it is going to and it's like okay i

1728
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,280
can tell it's going to honeywell.com and

1729
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,599
if honeywell were to implement like you

1730
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,000
know all of those like encrypted client

1731
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,960
hello

1732
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,599
and with with quick and

1733
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,599
um you know in in an attempt to like

1734
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,839
prevent me from being able to tell the

1735
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,760
server name that it was contacting right

1736
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,040
i think that was a big mistake on

1737
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,640
honeywell's part right i think honeywell

1738
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,200
should make a commitment to like

1739
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,440
yeah our thermostat goes to honeywell

1740
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,599
and maybe a few other you know providers

1741
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,680
that are associated with honeywell and

1742
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,680
and you should be able to tell that like

1743
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,880
because otherwise how are you supposed

1744
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,319
to know that like

1745
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,079
like uh

1746
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,240
i forget what

1747
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,160
there was a there was a brand of a

1748
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,160
router that was involved in a recent

1749
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,839
botnet right and it was like a home

1750
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,359
router that was in a bond i'm sorry i

1751
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,559
can't

1752
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,400
uh it doesn't come to mind now right but

1753
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,039
this is an example of like

1754
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,839
um home networks are you know don't

1755
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,400
necessarily have the security that

1756
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,480
we would want and

1757
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,280
um

1758
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,599
monitoring for on you know communication

1759
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,400
to

1760
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,799
unusual places on the internet uh

1761
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:19,680
you know

1762
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,000
is often valuable

1763
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,640
anyway it's a fantastic point chris and

1764
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,440
good for discussion

1765
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,319
hi sir my name is alex master i'm a

1766
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,400
graduate researcher here at purdue what

1767
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,960
i wanted to ask you specifically about

1768
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,960
your thoughts on

1769
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,520
tls so industry adoption of ech so

1770
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,400
i've been watching the rfc draft pretty

1771
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,280
closely we know that in 2018 cloudflare

1772
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,400
tried to roll out esni only web one web

1773
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,079
browser in the industry supported it

1774
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,839
eventually that kind of eroded and they

1775
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,240
stopped supporting esi

1776
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,839
and disclaimer i come from the

1777
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,799
countering censorship and consumer

1778
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,280
privacy part of the research equation

1779
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,280
and so i'm just interested in do you

1780
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,920
think that you know ech once this

1781
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,599
actually gets ratified if and when it

1782
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,599
gets ratified will industry actually be

1783
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,599
willing to embrace and adopt it because

1784
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,119
of some of the

1785
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,960
limited visibility that enterprises are

1786
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,400
going to have do you see that as

1787
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,000
something that they're eventually going

1788
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,760
to be willing to embrace in the sake of

1789
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,280
privacy or do you think it's going to be

1790
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,559
a challenge to roll it out from what

1791
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,640
we've seen with cloudflare and other

1792
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,200
protocol proposals that's a great

1793
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,799
question thank you um

1794
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,240
so

1795
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,000
i think you know the solution we we want

1796
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,079
to get to is one where

1797
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,000
um

1798
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,039
it's one more

1799
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,319
you know network defenders people

1800
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,559
defending information systems need to

1801
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,039
know that like you know when i pull down

1802
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,839
a docker container from docker hub

1803
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,440
and you know it doesn't contain software

1804
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,799
that goes out to

1805
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,400
some weird place right because somebody

1806
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
managed to infect that you know this

1807
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,760
particular container they put up a

1808
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,839
container there that actually does

1809
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,160
something nefarious and it's there and i

1810
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,160
can tell if i can see the communication

1811
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,119
but

1812
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,079
you know if i can't see the

1813
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,240
communication because it's using ech

1814
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,240
right that would be a problem um

1815
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,720
let me try to more directly answer right

1816
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,559
so the solution we want would be one

1817
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,000
where an enterprise that's actually

1818
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,440
defending something

1819
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,200
has some kind of visibility they have a

1820
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,240
way to

1821
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,280
um

1822
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,559
to to know

1823
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,200
what the software is connecting to

1824
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,319
and i i think there's a very

1825
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,240
serious case to be made that right there

1826
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,520
there does need to be a solution that

1827
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,200
permits visibility in some scenarios and

1828
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,359
you know within the itf i i have opposed

1829
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,240
several

1830
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,920
of the proposals that have been made

1831
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,440
that would weaken tls right and i think

1832
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,760
that's really important too and

1833
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,520
a couple of times i stood up at the itaf

1834
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,480
microphone and said um

1835
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,000
you know we need to not give the

1836
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,240
dictators the easy button

1837
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,000
right because that's the thing right you

1838
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,839
need to be wary so like something like

1839
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,680
the browser has like here you can

1840
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,920
integrate with the doh provider and the

1841
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,400
doh provider um

1842
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,720
has you know this visibility and control

1843
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,559
they can give to the enterprise so and

1844
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,000
then there's there's got to be a way

1845
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,119
that within the enterprise you can

1846
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,200
actually direct people to hey here's the

1847
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,720
doh you should be using if you're going

1848
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,640
to be accessing this network right

1849
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,039
so i think some of that's in motion

1850
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,440
and and certainly ech could be part of

1851
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,280
that solution

1852
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,079
so

1853
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,319
um

1854
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,599
that

1855
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,280
uh

1856
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,880
you know they're i'm hoping that there's

1857
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,640
there's some kind of

1858
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,440
uh that it's possible to get to like a a

1859
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,039
happy medium there

1860
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,280
um

1861
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,920
and you know i hate to say it but in in

1862
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,520
a lot of ways i think the current

1863
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,760
situation is like the

1864
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,480
as bad as it gets right you know it's uh

1865
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,240
um if you look at the possible solution

1866
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,240
space right so it's like people using

1867
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,200
toy

1868
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,720
it's obvious that they're using tor

1869
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,960
right so frankly you know if i lived in

1870
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,480
iran or russia you know i wouldn't be

1871
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,280
using

1872
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,839
because i'm pretty sure that gets

1873
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:06,480
a it it it's uh it's obvious to the

1874
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,760
people in charge that you're using it

1875
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,359
right so they're not getting that so

1876
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,559
they are getting

1877
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,119
uh a connection to tor

1878
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,520
but it's not actually hidden and then

1879
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,319
you know similarly with with things like

1880
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,559
um

1881
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,119
you know the the the server name

1882
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,880
it's something that

1883
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,000
uh

1884
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,760
in the vast majority of cases i don't

1885
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,520
think it's sensitive

1886
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,119
and i'll grant you though sometimes it

1887
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:32,480
is sensitive and those are the cases

1888
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,079
that matter right so

1889
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,000
um and again you know iran would be

1890
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,440
another good example right because there

1891
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,680
are probably places on the internet that

1892
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,880
you know you could visit that would get

1893
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,720
you instantly thrown in jail

1894
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,599
for

1895
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,480
uh

1896
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,599
yeah

1897
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:46,400
so

1898
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,480
i don't know i'm rambling

1899
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,680
we should connect after this right

1900
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,359
because i'd love to talk to you more

1901
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,160
thank you sir i appreciate it

1902
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,359
uh don't you serious uh thank you for a

1903
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,839
very technically motivating uh speech

1904
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,359
so my question is regarding mpf so i

1905
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,480
i agreed that the mpf is a very powerful

1906
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,440
method and approach to ioc and also for

1907
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,599
indicating especially early stage

1908
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,280
attacks and all that

1909
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,960
i also know that the mpf or the related

1910
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,440
mp reverse engineering techniques they

1911
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,839
could be you know in different contexts

1912
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,319
you know a kind of a double-sided sword

1913
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,119
um

1914
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,480
would you be worrying about using mpf or

1915
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,039
mp reverse engineering for actually

1916
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,359
kind of violate the you know privacy of

1917
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,520
user especially for example in a

1918
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,359
wireless environment

1919
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,359
the network protocol fingerprinting

1920
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,440
technologies are so advanced right with

1921
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,839
machine learning and all that now

1922
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,079
uh at least based on my own experience

1923
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,559
i'm actually able to infer not only the

1924
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,559
specific network protocol that is being

1925
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,480
used i can even infer what is the

1926
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,720
specific stage or what is the specific

1927
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,880
operation that is going on at the end

1928
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,839
system so for example i have a uh

1929
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,480
airline app i can actually differentiate

1930
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,640
between your online checking and the

1931
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,359
online purchase and for a online dating

1932
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,680
app i can differentiate between browsing

1933
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,240
your potential contacts and chatting

1934
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,200
with a specific friend so that kind of

1935
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,439
information can be

1936
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,920
disclosed with high accuracy because of

1937
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,000
mpf mp reverse engineering so what is

1938
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,920
your insight on kind of balancing

1939
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,000
because we're supposed to fight the

1940
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,120
attack right to enhance ioc not to

1941
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,000
compromise privacy

1942
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,880
yeah

1943
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
so if you actually look at what it's

1944
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,000
possible to infer encrypted connections

1945
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,399
it's it there's a tremendous amount of

1946
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,238
things that could be inferred

1947
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:43,359
um

1948
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,319
my colleague blake anderson did a a

1949
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,359
study of http 2 protocol machinery

1950
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,600
it you could learn you could infer like

1951
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,279
a huge amount of what was actually going

1952
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,000
on inside of an http 2 connection which

1953
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,399
is was really meaningful like

1954
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,279
like

1955
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,560
file sizes say right um

1956
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,920
that are you know the size of the files

1957
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,520
going up and down

1958
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,198
um

1959
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,238
i think

1960
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:12,158
let's see i really tried to focus more

1961
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,238
on visibility and then some of the basic

1962
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,479
inferencing things right which is like

1963
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,719
what operating system you're using or

1964
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,399
maybe more importantly like i'm using an

1965
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,839
operating system that's patched and up

1966
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,880
to date i i'm not running you know

1967
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,479
unpatched windows 8 or something like

1968
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,158
that right i mean that's there's no

1969
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:29,679
privacy issues there

1970
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,920
um

1971
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,000
definitely i think in theory there's

1972
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
probably a lot of privacy invasive stuff

1973
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,679
that could be done

1974
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:40,640
i

1975
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,560
i'm a little bit skeptical that it's

1976
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,319
actually being done

1977
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,479
and i might be wrong about that but in

1978
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,960
my own you know in in my experience like

1979
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,880
when you work on a big data project and

1980
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,319
you're trying to you've got billions of

1981
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,600
events a day

1982
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,199
and uh

1983
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,719
managing the scale of the data

1984
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,000
especially

1985
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,840
the sophisticated attacks need labeled

1986
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,480
data right so trying to get labeled data

1987
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,840
that's comprehensive at scale is

1988
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,719
uh

1989
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,120
is really really ugly right so

1990
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:09,840
uh

1991
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,040
i don't know it's an it's another

1992
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,480
interesting question right it deserves a

1993
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,920
lot more thought than than i could give

1994
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,000
it now

1995
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,360
i hopefully on the last question so

1996
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,600
people can get some break but um

1997
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,000
zac tutor uh idaho national lab um so

1998
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,760
when you're mentioning your example of

1999
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,280
monitoring you talk about so that the

2000
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,920
network you know sought certain data the

2001
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,440
host uh was providing other data and

2002
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,120
they didn't uh you know fully correlate

2003
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,120
so i'm kind of on the other side so when

2004
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,000
in this era of now ubiquitous sensing um

2005
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,199
you have endpoints all over the place

2006
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,880
you know flooding with data shouldn't

2007
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,400
the host just be providing the data

2008
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,239
that's important to it or that it thinks

2009
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,600
is important to the network and let the

2010
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,560
network

2011
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,920
then develop those things and if we

2012
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,159
collect everything we won't be able to

2013
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,159
analyze anything in enough time to stop

2014
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,400
an attack that might be coming that that

2015
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,519
sounds like a great vision to me

2016
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,800
so

2017
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,159
what you're saying totally makes sense

2018
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:06,960
and

2019
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,480
i still think there's there's a lot of

2020
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,400
challenges as far as like the visibility

2021
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,280
example would be like the

2022
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,880
the application software might not be

2023
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,080
cooperating

2024
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,840
with the operating system right so you

2025
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,440
install something as a shim in the

2026
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,239
operating system um like i don't know if

2027
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,920
anybody who does like

2028
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,400
monitoring on a host will know that

2029
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,000
there's all sorts of ways that packets

2030
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,320
can go from like an application onto the

2031
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
network that somehow like well wait a

2032
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,840
minute i inserted this shim that the

2033
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,360
operating syst you know the os vendor

2034
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,280
told me to do this shim here but somehow

2035
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,960
a packet got out onto the network right

2036
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,560
and and it's like okay there's another

2037
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,480
path there oh there's a raw socket or

2038
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,800
whatever like or like wait the

2039
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,320
the virtual machine thing goes through a

2040
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,440
tunnel and so there's this extra

2041
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,120
encapsulation i wasn't recognizing any

2042
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,760
of the packets um there's all sorts of

2043
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,440
like challenges to visibility and that's

2044
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,920
what i meant to allude to more than

2045
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,920
uh i was you know i

2046
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,679
anyway i hope that's clear anyway i

2047
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,040
think we've hit all the questions and i

2048
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,640
i think there's

2049
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,070
a break now

2050
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:12,710
[Applause]

2051
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,120
you
