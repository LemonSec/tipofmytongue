news released yesterday the 2023 ranking

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,759
of graduate school uh purdue engineering

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
is ranked number four

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,000
which is the highest among all the big

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,960

highly ranked programs across campus

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
in addition to engineering and also

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
within engineering if you look at the

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,239
the discipline ranking i think we're

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,760
doing extremely extremely well

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,799

for very bright talent all right so um

185
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
so my area of expertise is uh it's an

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
intersection of um of privacy security

187
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
and ammo so some of the things that you

188
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
that that we've done here in the project

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
they have direct applications to privacy

190
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
preserving machine learning and data

191
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
analysis so if you're looking for

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
someone who works at this intersection

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,639
please

194
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,280

well uh our next award uh is the diamond

210
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
award do you want to talk about the

211
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
diamond award

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
you got it

213
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
so uh so it's my honor and privilege

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
privilege to announce the diamond award

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
both for both 2021 and 2022 this year so

216
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
the diamond awards to a student that

217
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
most exemplifies the diamond in the

218
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
rough transition through outstanding

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
academic achievement and slash or

220
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
research excellence uh since we did not

221
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
uh give out the the diamond award last

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
year so we decided to uh you know award

223
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
uh make uh give one uh you know one

224
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,640
diamond award for the year 2021 and also

225
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
we have our

226
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
you know winners for 2022. uh so we

227
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
receive a number of uh nominations from

228
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,519
faculty from uh you know researchers

229
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
across campus nominating their students

230
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
so we we require that the students are

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
affiliated with serious and also going

232
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
through you know this transition you

233
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,800
know starting as a student and gradually

234
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
learning and doing research and becoming

235
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
you know a mature researcher engineer

236
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
practitioner so that is the kind of the

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,839
typical trajectory trajectory that we

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
are looking for so the selection

239
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
of the diamond award winners uh is

240
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,279
always a difficult task so it took us

241
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
quite some time

242
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
to actually reveal all the nominations

243
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
and determine the winner and for that

244
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
reason i do have to uh kind of apologize

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
for

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
we don't have that to play

247
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
because the customer yeah so because

248
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
since the you know we do have that the

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
certificate we would like to customize

250
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
it and we we uh we did not even have

251
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
time to actually send the names of our

252
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
winners um you know to the vendor right

253
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
to produce the uh the plague in time

254
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
so i have to pre-apologize for that so

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
when i uh

256
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
announce the winner uh if the winner is

257
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
in the audience please come up to the

258
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
podium and then we will just take a

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
picture shake hands and then we're gonna

260
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,360
ship or you know send uh the yeah later

261
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,120
um so without further ado the uh

262
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,440
2021 so that is last year uh diamond

263
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
award uh goes to

264
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
uh

265
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
well i watch oscar on sunday so let me

266
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
here you go uh

267
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
so uh dr tien how long so tenhau

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
already received his phd last year in

269
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
computer science and he's currently an

270
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
assistant professor of computer science

271
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
at the university of virginia he's

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
nominated by his advisor professor

273
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
ninghui lee

274
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
ten house phd research is on data

275
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
collection under the local differential

276
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
privacy model so differential privacy or

277
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
dp is a rigorous privacy notion that has

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
been widely accepted as the de facto

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
standard for data privacy so in recent

280
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
years there also there are also

281
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,320
technique for satisfying differential

282
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
differential privacy in the local

283
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,440
setting which is called ldp local

284
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
differentiate differentiation privacy

285
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,160
that further enable the gathering of

286
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,720
statistics while preserving privacy of

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
every user without relying on trust in a

288
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
single data curator so that's the unique

289
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
capability so tenhau has done

290
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
foundational work uh in the domain of

291
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
ldp developing techniques to analyze and

292
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
optimize the utility of ldp protocols

293
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,040
with high impacts in both research and

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,399
practice so i would like to uh

295
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,200
i guess 10 how himself is not here but i

296
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
would like to invite the professor

297
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
ninwali up to the podium so that we can

298
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
congratulate him

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,279
for graduating uh

300
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,839
our awardee lessons

301
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,440
um so let me announce the 2022 diamond

302
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
award winners and you may notice that i

303
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
use plural forms so there are actually

304
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
two winners for this year

305
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,320
so the first winner is noor jabber

306
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,760
from ece

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
noir is a phd candidate in the school of

308
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,720
ece and he is expected to graduate in

309
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
the summer of this year and he's

310
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,959
nominated by his co-advisor professor

311
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
rupcia samantha and marlene kucarni

312
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
so his phd focuses on formal method and

313
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,959
program synthesis and moreover as

314
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
described by his advisor

315
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
he from difficult beginning

316
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
through a long but very successful

317
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,600
career here at purdue all with the

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
backdrop of numerous challenges coming

319
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,839
from technical personal and family

320
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
aspects noah exemplifies the quality of

321
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,399
a diamond awardee who has overcome

322
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,040
adversity not just to arrive at purdue

323
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,079
literally but to strive at purdue

324
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,760
so

325
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,799

nuclear engineering and he's expected to

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
graduate also this summer he's nominated

339
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,399
by his advisor professor henry abdel

340
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,519
kalig

341
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
arben's phd has focused on the

342
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
development of new paradigm for

343
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
intelligent embedding in industrial

344
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
control systems to enhance the security

345
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,639
of ics

346
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
he has been recognized by the school of

347
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
nuclear engineering and awarded the

348
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
inaugural prestigious graduate research

349
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,360
recognition award earlier this month

350
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,519
finally arvin's work has served as the

351
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,800
basis for a nsf icorps award for

352
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
research commercialization where he

353
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,120
currently serves as the entrepreneurial

354
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
lead of this effort so congratulations

355
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,440
to arvind

356
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
thank you and our final award uh as uh

357
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
that we have today is every year

358
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,480
we give out a serious pillar award the

359
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
idea being is that somebody goes above

360
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,079
and beyond to prop up sirius

361
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,399
so we have taken people from staff we've

362
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
gotten people from

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
our industry partners those who are

364
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160
outside those who have found a way uh to

365
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
help us along the way that we may not

366
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,360
have seen as possible uh our award

367
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,360
winner um is is has been long dear to

368
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
sirius for all that he has has done for

369
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,320
us so as most of you know sirius is a

370
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,079
standalone institute at purdue we're not

371
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
part of one any department so we're not

372
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
funded by the university we have a

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
pseudo consortium

374
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,480
that has our strategic partners many of

375
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
them in the audience today uh who

376
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
provide a small amount of money that

377
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
provides just enough that we can all

378
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
i'll keep the lights turned on provide

379
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,880
some money to our researchers to to do

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
our faculty to do research and to

381
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,199
support our students so the support of

382
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,000
industry is is is extremely important to

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
sirius

384
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
i started at sirius being the internal

385
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
person that was trying to build these

386
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
relationships uh now managing director

387
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
sean huddy over here now has a role to

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
engage with industry

389
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,600
but

390
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
but this is a very large industry one

391
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
person really can't do it uh i can tell

392
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
you that because i was in that role for

393
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,839
a long time and so when you find

394
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,199
somebody else that can assist you in

395
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
this area it's a it's a big deal and

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
sirius has grown quite a bit over the

397
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
last few years

398
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
because we've had great partners but

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
also because we've had great help in

400
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
identifying organizations that would

401
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
benefit from a relationship so eric

402
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
woods is a senior director in the office

403
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
of industrial partnerships at purdue and

404
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
has been with purdue for nine years he

405
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
started as a corporate relations

406
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,280
director for a for a department for a

407
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
college

408
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
and in the past if we go back to when he

409
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,480
was first hired

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
corporate relations and advancement and

411
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
development people were tied to their

412
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,640
department so when a company said i'm

413
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
interested in talking to you about cyber

414
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
security

415
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,520
that person's motivator was who is in my

416
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
department that i can introduce you to

417
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
sirius is interdisciplinary we go across

418
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,880
every boundary on campus and we bring

419
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
together everybody that works in this

420
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
area uh when eric learned what we were

421
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
he said

422
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
we don't really have incentives for me

423
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
to bring people to you unless they're

424
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
working with this

425
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
but if somebody calls and said they want

426
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
to learn about cyber security how stupid

427
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
it would be for me to only introduce

428
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
them to the people that are in my

429
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
department

430
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,679
so he said hey i'm doing fine my bosses

431
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
are okay with we do this but i'm gonna

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
take care of the outside industry when

433
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
they say they're interested in cyber

434
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,039
security so from the day one on campus

435
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,120
eric started making sure that we met

436
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
everybody that was coming to campus that

437
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
he'd met that said hey we've got an

438
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
interest in cyber security

439
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
so over his tenure here there's been a

440
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
couple of transitions of his department

441
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
he ended up then running corporate

442
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
relations and told all of the other

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
corporate relations people who were tied

444
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
to their own departments

445
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
hey i yes we want you to take care of

446
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,400
engineer once you take care of computer

447
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
science we want you to take care of

448
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
krannert business you you have your

449
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
assignment but if somebody says cyber

450
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
security you have to call serious

451
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
because they know the people who can

452
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
help regardless of the department and at

453
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,480
the end we're corporate relations here

454
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
to help street engage in purdue and

455
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
we're not serving industry if we say

456
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
well i'll introduce you to the one

457
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
person that's doing cyber security in my

458
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,440
department so eric changed the culture

459
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,919
within per develop purdue development

460
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
others took note that

461
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
well duh this makes an awful lot of

462
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,640
sense

463
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
so they actually changed the entire

464
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
system based on what eric had been doing

465
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
and now corporate relation developers

466
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
are not tied to a department

467
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,600
they're tied to a theme

468
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
um

469
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,039
eric's current assignment is general

470
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
motors so if general motor says i want

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
to talk cyber security he knows a call

472
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
if they want to talk hey i want to talk

473
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
to you guys about mechanical engineering

474
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
uh hiring an iron type

475
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
deep deep mechanical injury he can do

476
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
that all these people have that but as

477
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
we know is cyber security is a cut

478
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
across so nearly every one of these

479
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,240
corporate relations directors eventually

480
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,799
hears yes we're in this industry but

481
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,120
we're interested in cyber security so

482
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
eric's initiatives over the nine years

483
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
completely changed the system and how

484
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
purdue does development and corporate

485
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
engagement

486
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,159
he has been instrumental in bringing

487
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,559
several of our partners introductions

488
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
and continues today

489
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
even though his

490
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,679
assigned

491
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,400
uh category is not cyber security or

492
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
computing so he's a guy who continues

493
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
what he's been preaching for nine years

494
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
that it doesn't matter

495
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
what where where our assignments are in

496
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,440
purdue if we want key engagement we need

497
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
to figure out what's important to the

498
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,039
industry partner and make sure that they

499
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,320
are leveraged they can leverage the

500
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
benefit of that's on campus this most

501
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
recent engagement with this is that

502
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,200
because of his long history of

503
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
understanding what we do and being

504
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
