for the end of the symposium our closing

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,159
keynote

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,119
um

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
dick and i met back in 1998 i think and

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
we've crossed paths

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
quite a few times since then in various

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
ways

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
i'm not going to go through and and

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
recount his biography you've got the

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
handout

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
he knows who he is you could read it

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
but he has played an important role in

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
national security and infrastructure

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,479
protection

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
back when i met him uh we were probably

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,159
two of

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
you know maybe a dozen people who really

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,759
cared about security at the time in the

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,040
cyberspace

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
arena and certainly it's grown since

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
then

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
he's going to talk about a fascinating

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,360
topic that few people can

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
speak with as definitively as he can

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,560
given his time in government and his

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
time as a consultant and his time as an

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
author of some very interesting fiction

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
uh you ought to check out his books if

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,319
you haven't

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,640
uh he's going to talk to us about

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
we're in a hybrid war

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
so

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,239
please join me in welcoming the esteemed

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
richard a clark

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,360
thank you i want you to know that the

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,440
only reason i came here was so that i

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,200
could hear a staff say that

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
because it's a very high honor to have

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
him say that

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,599
and

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,399
but you know him

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
so hybrid warfare

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
hybrid warfare

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,800
is what we are in

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
and it is very much dependent on i.t

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
and

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
we're

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
probably in the early stages maybe

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
of a major hybrid war so let's talk

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
about that

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
how does it

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
make hybrid war possible what is hybrid

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,319
war

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
so about a month ago

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
the wolf

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
dropped the sheep's clothing

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,599
about a month ago we were able finally

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,680
in case anyone had doubted it before

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,319
to see that vladimir putin is in a moral

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,640
sociopath

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
most of us

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,599
in the

86
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
national security business knew that for

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
a long time

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
but now the world knows it

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
and what he has embarked upon here he's

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,679
done before

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
he's trying out uh things from a

92
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,599
playbook that he's utilized in other

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
parts of the world

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,319
and it goes under the heading uh

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,920
according to

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
his top general uh general garasimov

97
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
who may or may not still be with us i'm

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
not sure um

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,959
general garasimov

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
gave a famous

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
lecture at the russian military academy

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,918
about hybrid war

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
and how russia would use it

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,080
uh in the future so what is hybrid war

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
hybrid war according to general

106
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,919
gerasimov is designed to substitute

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
or augment

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
conventional war

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,840
to substitute for regular weapons

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,759
tanks and things

111
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,880
or to augment them

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
the key thing about

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
hybrid war

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
is that the people who do it don't look

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,600
like the military

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
they're not in national military

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
uniforms

118
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
they may not be in the military at all

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
but what they do

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
in hybrid war is designed

121
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,880
to

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
disrupt

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
the enemy

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
and to

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
sow dissent

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
in the enemy ranks

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,440
there are lots of pieces to hybrid war

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
but the two i want to talk to you about

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
are the two that use i.t

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
and they are disinformatia

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
as the russians would call it

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
disinformation

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,400
and

134
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
cyber attacks

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
separate things

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
this information is something that the

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
soviet union

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
and before that the tsar

139
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,239
have been practicing for over 100 years

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,440
it is embedded in every russian soldier

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
russian officer in their military

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,600
academy that one of the

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
tools in your

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
toolbox

145
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,919
is

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,479
what they call maskarovka

147
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
camouflage concealment and deception

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
emphasis on the deception

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,000
and

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
it can be done

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
and should be done before as well as

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
during the war

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
and it can be done at the tactical level

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
where you make weapon systems that are

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
actually made out of plywood so the

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
enemy can see them and blow them up

157
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
it can be done at the strategic level

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,240
where you try to change the leadership

159
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
or the opinions of

160
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
the country that you're

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
fighting

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
i first came across

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
russian disinformation in the 1980s

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
when i was working in the reagan

165
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
administration yes i'm that old

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,599
in the intelligence

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
part of the state department

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599
and

169
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
we had an ambassador from an african

170
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,520
country an american ambassador to an

171
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
african country who was visiting and i

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,759
said well what are the problems you're

173
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
seeing in africa

174
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
and he said well the major one

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
is of course that the united states

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
invented hiv aids

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
i said excuse me

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
what

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
he said yeah the worcester institute

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
uh on the corner of 33rd street and

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
spruce in philadelphia right off the

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
penn campus the worcester institute

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
invented aids and it's designed to kill

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
black people

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
i didn't know what to say to this guy i

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
didn't know if he was kidding or if it's

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
insane or

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
he said

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,479
that's what everybody in africa believes

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
how could that be

191
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
it's it's the most

192
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
laughable thing i have ever heard

193
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
especially if you know the wiz star

194
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,878
institute

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
the russians had been placing that story

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
the soviets had been placing that story

197
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,000
all over africa

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
buying newspaper editors

199
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
buying tv

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
and radio people

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
to spread that story

202
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
and it was just accepted

203
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
by everybody in africa and no one in

204
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
washington knew it

205
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
until then

206
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,319
until it was too late

207
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
the effect that had on our image in

208
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
africa

209
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,719
continued until george w bush

210
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
did an incredible thing and that was to

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
pay for all of the hiv aids treatment in

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,679
africa

213
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,399
which we're still doing

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
the russians had that effect

215
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
with the big lie

216
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
the outrageous lie

217
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,839
they had that effect before the internet

218
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
when the internet came along

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
those same people

220
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
eventually realized what they could do

221
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
with the internet and i t technology to

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
spread

223
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
lies

224
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,440
and there is a very large bureaucracy

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
in russia

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
that does that every day

227
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,279
and it doesn't just do it

228
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,279
directed at the united states it does it

229
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
directed all over the world

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
with lots of different themes

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
now i

232
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
i'm going to warn you that what i'm

233
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
about to say is going to sound partisan

234
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
i don't mean it too

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
but it's going to sound a little bit

236
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
like perhaps the democratic party

237
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,399
talking points

238
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,160
it's not

239
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,519
this is factual pure factual i can

240
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,839
footnote i can send you to congressional

241
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
studies i can send you to intelligence

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
reports

243
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
they began

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
seriously working the united states

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
in 2015 and 2016 in terms of affecting

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
our election

247
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,760
they created tens of thousands

248
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
of american personas

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
on every social media you've heard of

250
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,160
and many that you have not heard of

251
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
they sent agents into the united states

252
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
to help them make those

253
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
postings credible by learning more about

254
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,839
our culture

255
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
and narrowing in on particular zones in

256
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
particular cities

257
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
they were able to be so convincing

258
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,360
that they organized rallies in the

259
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
united states

260
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,560
at which thousands of people showed up

261
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,920
and they organized those rallies

262
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,000
pretending to be americans and they did

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,680
it all from saint petersburg

264
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,720
they were able to get american citizens

265
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
to spend their money out of their pocket

266
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
to make fake jail cells

267
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
to buy

268
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
a prison jumpsuit and a blonde wig

269
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,600
and to get an american woman

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
to go sit in a fake jail cell

271
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
pretending to be hillary clinton in a

272
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,920
jail cell in a jumpsuit

273
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,200
and the orders for that to happen

274
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
originated in saint petersburg and were

275
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
carried out

276
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,399
by

277
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,079
americans who thought they were talking

278
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,199
to other americans

279
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,160
that's how extreme it was

280
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
now you can go on and on about the 2016

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
election but

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
realize they did that and that's

283
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
disinformation

284
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,079
they didn't stop there

285
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
they went on and

286
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,200
to continue their campaign because they

287
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,639
found a

288
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
vein in the united states that responded

289
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
to them

290
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
and we now know that a lot

291
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,160
of the anti-backs propaganda

292
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,120
and the anti-vax personas

293
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
that were on the internet beginning in

294
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
2020

295
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
were either created

296
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,399
in russia

297
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
or amplified by russia

298
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
and if you have any doubt about that

299
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
go and look at those anti-vaxx

300
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,079
media sites websites personas and social

301
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,360
media

302
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
and today what are they doing

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
they're saying how great putin is

304
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,680
and how the united states provoked him

305
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
to invade

306
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
ukraine and how ukraine deserved to be

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
invaded

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
there is a one-for-one correlation

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
and what those

310
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
websites are saying and what those

311
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
personalities are saying but we're

312
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,639
anti-vaxx and are now

313
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,440
pro-ukrainian invasion

314
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
pro-putin

315
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
you can directly trace individual

316
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,319
stories

317
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
one example i will give you is the

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
united states is in a joint program with

319
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,880
ukraine to make biological weapons

320
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
excuse my french but that's

321
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
there's absolutely

322
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,279
no truth to that nothing near truth to

323
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
that the united states doesn't even have

324
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
biological weapons

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
but that story

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
is widely believed

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
in a number of places around the world

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
and you can trace it from when it first

329
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,839
popped up

330
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
on russian media sites

331
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,639
and how then it moved from russian media

332
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,480
sites

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
to u.s social media sites

334
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,760
verbatim

335
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
talking points

336
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
and how it then moved from those u.s

337
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
social media sites

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,839
to certain american congressmen and

339
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,920
senators and on to certain american tv

340
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,319
networks

341
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,360
and so there are americans today

342
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
who go and get their news from those

343
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
websites and from those tv networks who

344
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,040
believe

345
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,399
that the government in washington that

346
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,760
they don't trust for all sorts of good

347
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
reasons

348
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
i worked in it i don't trust it either

349
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,639
should never trust the government

350
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,240
that that government is lying to them

351
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
and that government was involved in the

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
biological weapons program and that's

353
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
why putin invaded ukraine

354
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
and if you think that story is having

355
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
some effect here which it is

356
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,279
it's all over india

357
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,240
it's widely believed in india

358
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
every mainstream talk show in india is

359
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
talking about it

360
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
that's hybrid warfare that's one example

361
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
of hybrid warfare

362
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,360
the use of disinformation

363
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,160
to

364
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
justify what you're doing

365
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
to discredit your opponent but if you

366
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
are really good at it to cause

367
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,560
disruption and dissent

368
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,519
in the enemy camp

369
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,440
january 6th

370
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
is the culmination

371
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,839
of

372
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,600
disinformation january 6

373
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,880
is exactly what this was all about

374
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
to cause the physical manifestation to

375
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,440
cause americans by the thousands

376
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
to physically manifest

377
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
the propaganda line originating in

378
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
russia

379
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
so it was going on

380
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
before ukraine

381
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
but it is

382
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,839
now going on about ukraine

383
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,079
the good news

384
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
is that for the vast majority of

385
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,320
americans it's not working

386
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,839
it's not working on the ukraine

387
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,680
part the vast majority of americans if

388
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
you look at the polls support everything

389
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
that the united states and nato have

390
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,120
been doing to support

391
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
the zielinski government in ukraine so

392
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
it's not penetrating

393
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,279
um because it's ludicrous

394
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,560
and

395
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
we can all see what's going on in

396
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,680
ukraine by turning on cnn

397
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,519
so it's hard to overcome that

398
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,399
but in other cases where you can't go on

399
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,480
cnn and see truth

400
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
see it with your own eyes

401
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
in other cases

402
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,920
gullible americans are being duped

403
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,279
some of them

404
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
know it and some of them don't

405
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
and that

406
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,799
is what

407
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
hybrid warfare looks like

408
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,480
but the other aspect of it

409
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
and the one i think closer to spat's

410
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,679
heart

411
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,319
and the heart of most of you here

412
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,959
is cyber warfare

413
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,679
i wrote the book

414
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,799
14 years ago now something like that

415
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
with robert kennaki

416
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
called cyberwar

417
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
uh and

418
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
a sequel ten years later called the

419
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
fifth domain

420
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
when cyber war came out

421
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,919
we got one review in the newspaper that

422
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
said file under fiction

423
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
none of the things that these guys talk

424
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,160
about in this book could ever really

425
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
happen

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,280
that was a while ago

427
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
where we are today

428
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
fascinating difference

429
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,280
the president of the united states has

430
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,919
on three occasions publicly warned

431
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
russia not to engage in a cyber war

432
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,039
against the united states

433
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
the president of the united states has

434
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,320
called in

435
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,120
dozens of ceos of major american

436
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,880
companies

437
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
to tell them a cyber war is about to

438
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
happen and they need to do things

439
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
the president united states has told

440
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,919
russia that if you engage in cyber

441
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,760
attacks on the united states we will

442
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,720
respond in kind

443
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
and if you poll

444
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
ceos today

445
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
of major companies

446
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,080
if you poll

447
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
administrators of state and local

448
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,679
governments

449
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
and say are you concerned about cyber

450
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,039
war

451
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,039
right now the answer is yes

452
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,360
from almost all of them

453
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
so it went from being something that was

454
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
laughable and couldn't happen

455
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
to total acceptance

456
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,240
and

457
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
a high priority

458
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
i don't know when that shift occurred

459
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
but i think the war in ukraine marks a

460
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,559
major

461
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
milestone

462
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
in people's acceptance that cyber war

463
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,520
can happen

464
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
people have asked me well

465
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
you know if you keep warning about how

466
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
the ukraine war is going to spill over

467
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,480
into the united states in as a cyber war

468
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,559
why hasn't that happened why aren't we

469
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
in a cyber war

470
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,520
we are

471
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
we are in a cyber war

472
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
there are three theaters of this cyber

473
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,799
war

474
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,360
one is ukraine

475
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,400
where

476
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,200
the russians have tried

477
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
very very hard to knock off

478
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
communications

479
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
knocked off the satellite-based system

480
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
for

481
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
ukrainian military command and control

482
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
they have attempted to knock off the

483
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
major internet providers

484
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
and have had some limited success

485
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
they've taken down most of the

486
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,600
government websites

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,240
taking down most of the 911 systems

488
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
they've done a lot

489
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,480
but

490
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
it hasn't succeeded

491
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
this is one of the great lessons that we

492
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
will take away from the ukraine war and

493
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,960
there's a long list of lessons but one

494
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,520
of them is

495
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
try as the gru might

496
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
to ukrainian systems

497
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,919
through cyber war

498
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,880
they have

499
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,200
largely failed

500
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
and when they have succeeded in taking

501
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
down the system the ukrainians have

502
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
gotten it back up

503
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
or gotten a substitute back up within a

504
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
matter of days

505
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,760
why is that

506
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,360
two reasons one

507
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,880
this is not the first war between

508
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
ukraine and russia

509
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,799
this started in 2014

510
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,640
when the russians

511
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
took crimea

512
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,840
and as part of their hybrid war

513
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,559
the troops that did that

514
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,679
were the famous little green men

515
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,039
so-called little green men because they

516
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,039
were green uniforms that said nothing on

517
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,919
them

518
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
about russia

519
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,679
remember when i said the definition of

520
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,840
hybrid war don't make it look like it's

521
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
your military

522
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
the russians denied that it was their

523
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
military that took over crimea

524
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,679
it was just locals

525
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,720
local special forces

526
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
so the ukrainians started getting ready

527
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
in 2015

528
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
for the inevitable war big war with

529
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,918
russia that they knew would come

530
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
their military was pathetic

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
in 2014.

532
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
they had 6 000 troops that they could

533
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
put on into combat 6 000.

534
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,039
they've totally rebuilt their military

535
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,400
you can see the results today

536
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
and as part of that they built one of

537
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,799
the best defensive systems

538
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,720
for cyber attacks anywhere in the world

539
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,640
and they have partners

540
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
they have partners from every major

541
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,000
european government

542
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
and they have partners from every major

543
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
american cyber security firm

544
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
now i'm not going to say the names of

545
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
those firms

546
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
but you can go to the uh

547
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
you can go to your stock index and look

548
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,320
up cyber security firms and they're all

549
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
publicly traded

550
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
they don't want to attract attention

551
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
they don't want to have the russians

552
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
target them

553
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
but there are people in silicon valley

554
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
today

555
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
who are directly tied into kiev

556
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,960
and

557
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
who are working 24 hours a day seven

558
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,360
days a week with the ukrainian cyber

559
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
defenders

560
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
to keep that those networks back up and

561
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
to get them back up when they come down

562
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
intelligence is flowing at a rate i've

563
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
never seen before

564
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
and intelligence just doesn't come from

565
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
us intelligence agencies

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,679
intelligence in this business comes from

567
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,000
cyber security firms

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
as much as it does from nsa and cia

569
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
so in the first theater of cyber war

570
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
there is a battle going on in ukraine

571
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,200
the russians are doing as much as they

572
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
can do

573
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,799
and the ukrainians are holding them off

574
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,720
in cyberspace just as in physical space

575
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,440
the second theater of this cyber war

576
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
is russia

577
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,840
who's attacking russia

578
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,200
people from all around the world

579
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,400
in an uncoordinated way

580
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
you've heard about anonymous

581
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
doing attacks

582
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,880
they are a small group

583
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
of the greater picture

584
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,840
of

585
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
hackers

586
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
white hat gray hat

587
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
black hat

588
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
vigilante hackers

589
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
who are doing some fun things

590
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,039
and some doing some serious things

591
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,039
they are the fun thing is they're

592
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
getting the news through to russian

593
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,559
people

594
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
that they can't get on their

595
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
state-run media about what's going on in

596
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
ukraine

597
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
they're doing that by such brilliant

598
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
ideas as having home printers print off

599
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640
the news

600
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
but there is a real risk here

601
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
cyber war

602
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
just like nuclear war

603
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,400
they're very different but there are

604
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,799
some similarities

605
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,640
escalation has to be carefully

606
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
controlled

607
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
or it can get out of hand

608
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,720
miscommunication misunderstanding

609
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
of what the other side is doing

610
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
can be very very dangerous

611
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
russia today

612
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
could be forgiven for thinking

613
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,480
that we the united states are attacking

614
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
them

615
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
because people in the united states are

616
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
attacking them

617
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,279
and they mirror image a lot

618
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,559
they know

619
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,880
that hackers in russia are not allowed

620
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,080
to hack

621
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
targets in the united states without

622
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
russian government approval

623
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,919
and if you doubted that before

624
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
there's a treasure trove of new material

625
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
that hackers have been able to pull in

626
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
the last month from these criminal

627
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
organizations

628
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
that have been doing ransomware

629
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
and there it is in their own

630
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
communications about how they coordinate

631
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
with the fsb and they coordinate with

632
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,640
the gru

633
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,159
so the russians

634
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,840
may well think

635
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,080
that when hackers in the united states

636
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
or the netherlands

637
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,520
or france

638
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
or germany are attacking them it's with

639
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
government permission

640
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,799
that is putting pressure i'm afraid

641
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,799
on the russian leadership

642
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,880
to bring this cyber war

643
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,279
to the third theater

644
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,919
which is here

645
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,360
they haven't done that yet

646
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
talk in a minute about why

647
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,919
they may not have done that yet

648
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,400
but they've done it in the past

649
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
in both ukraine

650
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,480
and in the united states

651
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,840
they engaged in dry runs

652
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,279
they engaged in dry runs both for very

653
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
targeted attacks

654
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,320
and for indiscriminate attacks

655
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,840
let's start with the targeted attacks

656
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,840
on two

657
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,480
occasions

658
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
the russian military the gru hackers

659
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,279
collapsed parts of the ukrainian power

660
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,720
grid

661
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,679
knocking offline

662
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,679
now

663
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
the fact that they did that is probably

664
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,760
one of the reasons it hasn't happened

665
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,360
again

666
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
because the ukrainians with the help of

667
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,919
their friends figured out how that was

668
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,880
done

669
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,399
and made it more difficult to do

670
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,880
but they did a targeted attack twice

671
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
against the ukrainian power grid

672
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,600
shutting it down

673
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,760
and for those of us who live on the east

674
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,080
coast we remember

675
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,880
not being able to get gasoline last year

676
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,919
because the colonial pipeline

677
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,679
which brought most of the gas and most

678
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
of the jet fuel

679
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,000
to the east coast and northeast

680
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,520
was attacked by a russian hacker group

681
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,279
targeted attacks

682
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,240
if the russians choose to respond

683
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
to our sanctions we'll talk about that

684
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,279
in a sec

685
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,960
one of the targets

686
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,039
will surely be

687
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,120
things like refineries and pipelines

688
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
because they want to put pain and

689
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,159
pressure on our economy and on our

690
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,399
leadership just as our economic

691
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,279
sanctions have put pain and pressure on

692
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,360
their economy and their political

693
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,880
leadership

694
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,200
the place to do it

695
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,320
is pipelines and refineries

696
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
we're going to replace some of the

697
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,720
russian lng that is going to europe well

698
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
we're only going to do that

699
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
if two

700
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,600
export terminals in louisiana and texas

701
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,320
are functioning

702
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,159
and let me tell you they both rely a lot

703
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,720
on i.t

704
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,200
i could say more they would be

705
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,679
depressing but i won't

706
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,919
targeted attacks

707
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,480
they also did indiscriminate attacks

708
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
both in ukraine

709
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,600
and in the united states

710
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
the famous case of not pecha does

711
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,520
everyone know what not patio was i

712
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,039
assume in this audience

713
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
most people do

714
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,960
not patio was

715
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,399
taking a software provider in ukraine a

716
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,760
software provider that made the tax and

717
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
audit accounting that everyone used

718
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,520
in ukraine

719
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,279
think of it as

720
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,279
quickbooks

721
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,080
or

722
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
something more

723
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,799
enterprise focused

724
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
they got into the build for the software

725
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
they could enfor into the software

726
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
supply chain into the software update

727
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
and put a piece of malware

728
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,039
that looked like it was the petia

729
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,520
ransomware

730
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,799
but it was not petya

731
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,200
it was in fact wiperware

732
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
and it wiped out all of the software on

733
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,679
all of the networks

734
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,520
so routers servers printers laptops

735
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
mobile phones

736
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,279
desktop iphones

737
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,320
had no software on them and were useless

738
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,360
except his doorstops

739
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,919
that was the russian gru

740
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,600
they did a similar

741
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,360
and and by the way when i say it's

742
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
indiscriminate attack not only did they

743
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
do that to thousands of ukrainian

744
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,760
companies but as you probably know it

745
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
jumped out

746
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
from ukraine and wiped out companies

747
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
around the world

748
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,240
wiped out the largest

749
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,760
port

750
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,279
management firm

751
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,080
uh in the world mersk burst shipping

752
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
ports all over the world ground to a

753
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,720
halt the big cranes that move containers

754
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
all over the world stopped in mid-air

755
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,399
in the united states

756
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
merck pharmaceuticals

757
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
their production line in new jersey

758
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,559
stopped running

759
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,360
and these facilities were down

760
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,918
for weeks

761
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,600
and in the particularly nasty thing

762
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,399
the the virus hit the maker of oreo

763
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,879
cookies

764
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,159
it was the

765
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,000
largest case

766
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,399
of cyber damages in history

767
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
the insured losses

768
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,159
exceed 1.5 billion dollars

769
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,799
totally indiscriminate attack

770
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,240
but they did it here too

771
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,279
solar winds

772
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,240
solar winds is the classic

773
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,519
software supply chain attack

774
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,000
and it is a technique

775
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,919
that to this day we don't have a good

776
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,039
solution for

777
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,559
you want a good research project for

778
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,240
somebody

779
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
tell me how the stop solar winds

780
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,720
style software supply chain attacks

781
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,840
they got into the build process at a

782
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,080
company that was widely used 14 000

783
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,480
customers

784
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,880
they put an incredibly sophisticated

785
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
zero day

786
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
into that build

787
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,320
and solar winds pumped it out to its 14

788
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,279
000

789
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,360
companies as the monthly software update

790
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,559
no detection system caught it

791
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
14 000 leading american companies

792
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,320
federal departments

793
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,880
none of them in the techniques that they

794
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
used to scan software before they put it

795
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
on their networks none of them caught it

796
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,039
and this was not two lines of code

797
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,279
this is a very complex piece of malware

798
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,880
it ran for months

799
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,880
on thousands of american companies

800
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,519
and no one caught it

801
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,039
and we can name

802
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,320
the very sophisticated cyber products

803
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
from very good american companies that

804
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,760
we're running on these networks

805
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,399
you know in my consulting business when

806
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,399
somebody says to me well yeah do i need

807
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,799
an edr do i need an mdr yes buy this one

808
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
by that way none of them worked

809
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,039
and by luck one of the companies that

810
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
was hit was fireeye mandiant

811
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,000
and by luck

812
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,519
months into the hack

813
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
one very astute fellow

814
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,840
noticed an anomaly and pulled the

815
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,720
thread that's how we discovered it

816
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
totally indiscriminate attack

817
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,159
in thousands of companies

818
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
i'd love to do a poll of this audience

819
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,039
and ask the question

820
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,720
was solar winds the only one they did

821
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
that too

822
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,399
no

823
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,520
it's the only one we're caught

824
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,079
so as

825
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,240
bad as they're doing in ukraine

826
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
there's reason to believe that if they

827
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,760
wanted to bring the war the cyber war to

828
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,719
this theater the third theater

829
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,918
it would have some devastating effects

830
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,759
so why hasn't it happened

831
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,079
i don't know

832
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,040
i found in dealing with american

833
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
presidents then when they ask you a

834
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,639
question occasionally answering it that

835
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,839
way gives you credibility

836
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,320
i am the vaguest idea

837
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,400
the only possible explanation that i

838
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
have not been able to invalidate

839
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,839
is that we have deterred them

840
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,280
and

841
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
if you read cyber war or you read the

842
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
fifth domain i go on for pages about how

843
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,160
we can't deter them

844
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,359
how

845
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
our saying we'll do cyber war to you if

846
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
you do cyber work to us

847
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
won't stop them

848
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,200
because they can take the heat they can

849
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,720
take the pain a they're less

850
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
technologically dependent

851
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
on network systems and b

852
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,760
they're not going to be a lot of people

853
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,880
protesting in the streets

854
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
but it's just possible i'm

855
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,640
entirely wrong about that

856
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,880
when joe biden said to them

857
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,680
if you engage in cyber war

858
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
we will do the same to you

859
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,200
that may have had an effect

860
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,400
because even though we think putin can

861
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
lock everybody up

862
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,640
and we think putin can suppress dissent

863
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,119
even he is worried about the mob even he

864
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,800
is worried about

865
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,359
uprisings if there's one thing we know

866
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,599
from looking at his conversations with

867
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,040
interlocutors over the course of the

868
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,000
last 10 years 20 years

869
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,320
10 years he's been talking about the

870
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,640
terrible color revolutions

871
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
the orange revolution in ukraine the

872
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,599
green revolution

873
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,359
the arab spring

874
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,400
where

875
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,880
dictators were

876
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,640
killed

877
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,280
he obsesses about that

878
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,599
reportedly he's watched the video of

879
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,640
mumar qaddafi being brutally killed over

880
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,680
and over and over

881
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
fear of the mob

882
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
i had a professor at the kennedy school

883
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
who

884
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,040
taught us that

885
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
if you're trying to analyze somebody

886
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,400
sitting across the table from you try to

887
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,839
find out what were the

888
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,040
formative

889
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,520
traumatic events in their life

890
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,440
in their professional life

891
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
because

892
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,440
even though the world has changed

893
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
they're still concerned about that kind

894
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,800
of thing well for vladimir putin

895
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,079
when the berlin wall fell

896
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,079
he was a young major in the kgb

897
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
in east germany in dresden

898
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,640
and the mob came down the street

899
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:32,800
with

900
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
torches

901
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
placards

902
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,720
and they went for his building the kgb

903
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
building

904
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
and they were going to do to it what

905
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,480
they had done to the secret police the

906
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
stasi down the street

907
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
and he had to summon up all of his

908
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,720
courage

909
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,560
and get two other

910
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
kgb guys

911
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
and stand on the steps of that building

912
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,839
with a

913
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
rifle

914
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,879
and ward off the mob

915
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,720
so

916
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,599
that's a very vivid image in his mind

917
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,200
which has been reinforced by the color

918
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
revolutions

919
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,440
i think he's actually worried

920
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,280
that if we really did a cyber attack

921
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,599
a major cyber attack

922
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,160
on his economy we could make it even

923
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
worse

924
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,359
and if you've seen the videos of riots

925
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,839
in stores in moscow

926
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,359
riots over when they bring the sugar out

927
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,359
to put the sugar on the shelves

928
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,280
complete mayhem

929
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,040
people fighting each other to get the

930
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
bags of sugar

931
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
because the economic effects the

932
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,040
economic sanctions are already

933
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
having some effect

934
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,200
so maybe we've determined

935
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,040
or maybe we've just deterred him for now

936
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,400
and as

937
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
the economic sanctions grind harder and

938
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
harder on his economy

939
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
maybe the voices in his councils who are

940
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,720
telling him retaliate retaliate against

941
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,440
the united states

942
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
maybe

943
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,359
he will

944
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,200
so if you think about

945
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,839
the sort of escalatory ladder i know if

946
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,079
any of you ever read herman cahn's book

947
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
on escalation

948
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,880
it's 1966 so you probably haven't but i

949
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,839
went back and found it

950
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,599
khan goes into great detail about the

951
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
escalatory ladder

952
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,160
uh in conflict and and how you have to

953
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,760
control it now you have to be

954
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
intentional about movement from one

955
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,680
stage to another

956
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
now you can signal with it and how you

957
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
can miscommunicate that's why i worry

958
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
about the vigilantism

959
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,880
but

960
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,599
the escalatory ladder here is

961
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,560
russia invades ukraine step one step two

962
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,520
the united states the eu the g7 slap on

963
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,400
really draconian unprecedentedly

964
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,320
draconian economic sanctions

965
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,800
there's a joke going around moscow

966
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,119
what's the difference between a dollar

967
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,280
and a rupal

968
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,760
a dollar

969
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
these these are sanctions that are

970
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,839
really really hurting

971
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,240
well the next step on the escalatory

972
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,839
ladder

973
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,480
is likely ramping up that hybrid warfare

974
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,119
going to the third theater and attacking

975
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,200
the united states the eu

976
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,000
in cyberspace and causing

977
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,720
economic damage to us

978
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,319
causing pipeline damage to us

979
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,520
could still happen

980
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720
but biden didn't just

981
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
tell putin if you do it i'll do it back

982
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
to you in spades

983
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
he also as i said earlier he brought in

984
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,079
all the american ceos

985
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,920
he brought in all the american ceos and

986
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
said you can improve your security and

987
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,560
you don't have a lot of time to do it

988
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,480
but we will open up the intelligence

989
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
treasure trove

990
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,160
we will share information we will cut

991
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,440
through the and cut through the

992
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
red tape and we will work with you

993
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,280
to go shields up

994
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,720
now when i heard that i was a little mad

995
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
because

996
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,079
about 18 months ago

997
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,400
i wrote an essay and spread it around to

998
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,760
everybody

999
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,880
saying

1000
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,920
in a period of crisis you can to quote

1001
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,680
star trek go shields up

1002
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,799
and i didn't trademark it

1003
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,480
and now if you go to the homeland

1004
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,359
security department cisa's web page what

1005
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,040
does it say in

1006
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
giant letters

1007
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,279
shields up

1008
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,359
well can you really do that

1009
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,119
can you really

1010
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,960
do things day to day

1011
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,040
and then in a period of crisis in the

1012
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,800
period when you are anticipating an

1013
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
attack

1014
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,880
do different things do more can you

1015
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,400
i argued

1016
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
about two years ago that you could

1017
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,319
there were a series of things that most

1018
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
companies aren't doing

1019
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,960
and they could do

1020
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,760
uh

1021
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,000
i published that then

1022
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,839
mandiant has published a similar one

1023
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,359
since most of the cyber security

1024
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,880
companies have published a similar list

1025
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,400
cisa at homeland

1026
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
has compiled those and refined it

1027
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,079
and they have their list

1028
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
but

1029
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,839
since this is

1030
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
indiana and that great son of indiana

1031
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
david letterman

1032
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,598
invented the top 10 list

1033
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
i'm going to give you my

1034
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,240
top 10 list

1035
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,280
in terms of how you go shields up

1036
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,400
and then i'm going to trademark it

1037
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
the first one is patch patch patch patch

1038
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,240
patch

1039
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,599
do not wait

1040
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,200
for the one day a month that you patch

1041
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,160
patch

1042
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,520
at least during this period of

1043
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
heightened tensions at least during the

1044
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,800
time when your shields are up patch when

1045
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
the patch comes in

1046
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,839
and

1047
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,640
trust

1048
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,560
trust that it doesn't have malware in it

1049
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,440
while you're at patching

1050
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,680
go back and look this is still number

1051
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,640
one

1052
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,240
go back and look at your risk register

1053
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,079
every company

1054
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
has a risk register

1055
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,319
every company has a cyber security

1056
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,560
chapter of its risk register

1057
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
and nobody ever looked at it

1058
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,960
except to create it so that when the

1059
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,040
audit firms come along they can show it

1060
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,359
to them

1061
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,599
to the extent that your risk register

1062
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,760
has any

1063
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,440
semblance of reality to it

1064
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,760
pull forward some of the things that you

1065
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,040
were going to do

1066
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,520
next year

1067
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,240
if there are

1068
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
high level category red category

1069
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,280
risks that you are running and you we're

1070
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,800
going to do them

1071
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,880
address them next year

1072
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
address them now if you need more money

1073
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,400
for that get more money for that

1074
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,720
i know i tell all my clients you can't

1075
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,079
do everything in a year you need a three

1076
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,160
year plan blah blah blah

1077
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
take a look at your high level risks in

1078
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,480
your risk register and pull forward the

1079
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
ones

1080
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,280
that are most appropriate

1081
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,480
number two

1082
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,480
get more eyes on glass now

1083
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,160
make sure that that sock is

1084
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,359
staffed 24 7 and if you don't have the

1085
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,960
people to do that

1086
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,480
hire an mssp

1087
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,640
or shift people over

1088
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,000
from the i.t department

1089
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,319
the speed with which you identify the

1090
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,839
problem

1091
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,839
and

1092
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,640
act determines the effect of the of the

1093
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,800
attack

1094
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,839
and if no one's seeing it

1095
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,160
if it's lost in a series of alarms

1096
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
the damage can be done in a matter of

1097
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
minutes

1098
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
so more eyes on glass

1099
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,880
number three

1100
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,440
yeah multi-factor authentication

1101
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
but multi-factor authentication with the

1102
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,400
physical key

1103
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,640
and

1104
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
the federal government's policy now is

1105
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,640
zero trust zero trust zero trust yeah

1106
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,000
zero trust

1107
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,119
says find all sorts of places where you

1108
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,440
aren't using mfa

1109
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,520
or aren't using authentication at all

1110
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
and install mfa

1111
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,119
and please do it with a physical key

1112
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,000
because as we know there are ways around

1113
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,520
other forms of mfa

1114
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,920
number four

1115
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,040
take a look at your backup

1116
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,160
you may find it's shocking the number of

1117
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,319
major companies and enterprises whose

1118
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,839
backup is online

1119
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,480
anybody see a problem with that

1120
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
have your backup

1121
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,680
offline

1122
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,119
and have it at varying intervals in time

1123
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,560
going back as far as you can go back

1124
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,760
because you may have backed up

1125
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,119
malware

1126
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,720
and if you mount it

1127
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,920
it may again affect your system

1128
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,800
which case go back to the next one

1129
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,839
have

1130
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,599
offline backup

1131
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,040
for multiple periods in time

1132
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,400
number five go to active blocking

1133
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
companies have invested lots of money in

1134
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,319
data loss prevention tools

1135
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,760
uh dlp and other things which they have

1136
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,160
on alarm

1137
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,319
well

1138
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,920
during this period where the shields are

1139
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,880
up

1140
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,240
take the switch

1141
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,079
move it over from alarm to block

1142
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,079
yes you will block good stuff

1143
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,599
that's fine

1144
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,920
the world won't end

1145
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,000
people will complain to you

1146
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,280
when they complain to you you can let it

1147
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
go

1148
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,880
if someone you know calls up and says

1149
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,680
you

1150
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,240
that you've blocked them

1151
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,000
they have a russian accent probably not

1152
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,800
number six

1153
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,960
get a tip get a thread intelligence

1154
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,079
program

1155
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,000
there are lots of companies

1156
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,880
out there um probably too many but there

1157
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
are lots of companies out there who

1158
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,760
provide really good threat intelligence

1159
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
information and they will give it to you

1160
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,680
days before cisa will give it to you

1161
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,559
and days matter

1162
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,920
so buy your intelligence

1163
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,599
number seven

1164
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,079
block inward and outward dns

1165
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,880
domains and ip addresses that you don't

1166
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,119
need

1167
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,760
your enterprise your institution doesn't

1168
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,200
need to be communicating with everybody

1169
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,359
in the world

1170
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,119
there are vast blocks of dns and ip that

1171
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,960
you can just block

1172
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,839
inbound and outbound

1173
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,119
and you can get a daily update

1174
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
on what those domains are

1175
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,400
from your threat intelligence company

1176
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,599
number eight

1177
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,880
educate

1178
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,599
the workforce

1179
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
the workforce wants to be part of the

1180
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,160
solution

1181
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,839
but if all you tell them is they have to

1182
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,359
change their password every time they go

1183
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,880
to the bathroom they're not going to do

1184
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,040
it

1185
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,839
have an all hands meeting

1186
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,040
virtual or in person

1187
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
go back to world war ii style put up

1188
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,440
posters

1189
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,800
you know loose lips sing ships

1190
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,640
tell them if they think it's fishing

1191
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,359
what to do educate them about how to

1192
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,680
identify fishing

1193
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,440
give them prizes

1194
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,599
if they successfully identify fishing

1195
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,599
make it a competition make it fun

1196
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,079
and tell them why

1197
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,520
all of these additional security

1198
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,640
measures are

1199
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
being put into effect appeal to their

1200
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,759
patriotism

1201
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,200
number nine find somewhere in the filing

1202
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,520
cabinet at the back of the room

1203
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,000
covered in dust your incident response

1204
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,319
plant

1205
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,119
and your business continuity plan which

1206
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,920
are two different things

1207
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,720
dust them off see if they make sense

1208
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,520
and update them

1209
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,720
why are they two different things an

1210
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,839
incident response plan tells you

1211
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,599
what to do when something has just

1212
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,079
happened

1213
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,000
and how do you run the crisis

1214
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,520
and

1215
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,680
there a good incident response plan is

1216
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,960
fairly complex

1217
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,640
and it should be tailored to your

1218
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,040
company

1219
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,680
the business continuity plan

1220
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,079
is how do you run the business

1221
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,319
while it's down how do you run the

1222
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,280
business

1223
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,520
while nothing over here is working

1224
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,800
finally

1225
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,839
the

1226
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,480
transportation security agency

1227
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
recently told the railroads

1228
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,760
that by the end of june

1229
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
they have to have a business continuity

1230
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,960
plan

1231
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,480
that tells

1232
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,079
the government how are they going to run

1233
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,319
the railroad when their network has been

1234
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,920
hacked and isn't available

1235
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,119
well we all need that

1236
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,440
not just the railroads we all need an

1237
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,040
instant response plan

1238
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,440
and we all need a business continuity

1239
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,200
plan that tells us how we're going to

1240
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,920
work when nothing works

1241
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,079
quick war story you all remember when

1242
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,359
north korea

1243
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,960
the leader of north korea the dear

1244
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,280
leader of north korea

1245
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
got very upset about a movie that sony

1246
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,440
was going to release

1247
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,359
and they launched a piece of wiperware

1248
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,000
remember wiperware not betja

1249
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,680
against sony

1250
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
sony pictures entertainment just that

1251
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,200
division

1252
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
i happened to be in la that day and i

1253
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,640
got a call could you come over

1254
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,280
and so i went drove up to the gate

1255
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,200
big hollywood lot

1256
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
and the security guard looked at me and

1257
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,680
said no i don't need to see your id

1258
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,359
i can't look up on the computer to see

1259
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,040
if you have an appointment because the

1260
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,280
computer doesn't work and i can't print

1261
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,119
you out a parking pass or a building

1262
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,800
pass because the computer doesn't work

1263
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,760
so just go in

1264
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,319
so i walked in to the lobby

1265
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,720
the beautiful art deco lobby

1266
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
uh

1267
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,800
at sony and

1268
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,960
there were two young women

1269
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,280
hand-writing out paychecks in a long

1270
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,559
line of people

1271
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,440
and as they walked up to the line

1272
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,200
the woman would say to them how much do

1273
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,520
you get paid

1274
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,960
it was payday

1275
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,160
they wanted to make sure everybody was

1276
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,599
paid

1277
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
but they had no adp system no personnel

1278
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
no way of doing that so they trusted

1279
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,839
everybody and they hand draw that

1280
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,319
paycheck which is nice right

1281
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,720
consider it

1282
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,480
i then walked into the

1283
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,160
board room

1284
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,599
and they were all

1285
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,000
all these executives were

1286
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,200
complaining

1287
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,640
uh but they'd had to stop making movies

1288
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,160
they had all these actors on the lot

1289
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,040
that were sitting around doing nothing

1290
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
nothing was working

1291
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,880
uh the

1292
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,359
iphones didn't work the ip phones on the

1293
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,960
desk didn't work nothing worked the

1294
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,880
cameras didn't work in the

1295
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,800
in the studios

1296
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,440
and then some guy broke into the meeting

1297
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,240
with a shoebox

1298
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,559
and it had about a dozen blackberries in

1299
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,440
it

1300
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,680
and he said i found the blackberries and

1301
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,480
they still work

1302
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,200
and i then got to see 20 really highly

1303
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,520
paid hollywood executives fight each

1304
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,640
other over who is going to get the

1305
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,200
blackberry

1306
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,119
so it's nice to have a business

1307
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,440
continuity plan that will tell you how

1308
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,280
you're going to run the enterprise when

1309
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,079
nothing works

1310
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,440
and number 10

1311
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,680
drum roll

1312
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,400
take that incident response plan

1313
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,680
and exercise it

1314
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,200
if you don't understand the importance

1315
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,319
of exercising it in the real world as

1316
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,319
real as you can get talk to your

1317
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,359
basketball coach

1318
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,680
you can have the best game plan in the

1319
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,280
world

1320
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,280
he would never think

1321
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,960
of putting the purdue basketball team

1322
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,760
out on the field out on the court

1323
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,119
with a really good

1324
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,720
plan for the game if they hadn't

1325
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,880
exercised it

1326
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,720
and yet company after company around the

1327
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,200
united states has an incident response

1328
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,319
plan covered in dust that has never seen

1329
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,160
the light of day

1330
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,960
in the c-suite

1331
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,760
never been exercised involving the real

1332
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,319
ceo

1333
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,040
or the real ceo or the real cfo

1334
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
if ever there is a time

1335
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,839
to exercise response plans

1336
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,280
it's now

1337
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,280
because the difference in companies that

1338
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,440
have done that

1339
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,119
and companies that haven't

1340
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,200
when the real thing happens

1341
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,680
is night and day

1342
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,160
so my motto for this is

1343
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,799
never let

1344
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:29,599
a

1345
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,000
cyber crisis

1346
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,160
never let your first cyber crisis be a

1347
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,640
real one

1348
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,599
have as real as you can get a cyber

1349
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
crisis now

1350
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,559
that's what i would do there are lots of

1351
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,640
other suggestions for going shills up

1352
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,119
that's my top 10 list but the important

1353
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,559
message is

1354
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,960
that the president is telling companies

1355
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,799
to go shields up

1356
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,400
and no longer

1357
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,880
do we have the problem that we had

1358
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,640
for a couple of decades of people

1359
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,640
thinking we were mad

1360
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,799
in talking about cyber war

1361
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,799
now we're in one

1362
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,960
and the only question is will it come

1363
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,040
here

1364
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,480
so let me stop there i know we'll get

1365
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,559
time limits

1366
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,240
be glad to take any

1367
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,440
reasonable

1368
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,559
decent questions

1369
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,440
if you have a question please line up

1370
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,520
the microphone

1371
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,880
is that on thank you

1372
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,480
okay

1373
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,599
the red light's on

1374
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,040
oh

1375
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,200
thank you all right

1376
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,040
so this may be an unreasonable unfair

1377
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,559
question and so if you say i don't know

1378
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,240
i totally understand

1379
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,559
but in simplistic terms there's kind of

1380
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,240
a race right now between how many

1381
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,760
ukrainians will die

1382
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,200
and when the russians will pull out and

1383
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,960
maybe possibly when putin is no longer

1384
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,480
in power

1385
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
any smart guys speculating or thinking

1386
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,319
about that or if they are

1387
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,680
we don't know it

1388
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,880
oh there are lots of smart guys

1389
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,240
speculating about it no one knows what

1390
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,040
they're talking about though

1391
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,720
the thing

1392
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,839
about this ukrainian war has been how

1393
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,920
humiliating it has been

1394
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,880
for

1395
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,400
experts and prognosticators

1396
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,319
the

1397
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,440
the room

1398
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
that you could fill with all of the

1399
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
experts that said the russian military

1400
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,079
was pathetic

1401
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,599
would be a very small phone booth

1402
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,520
nobody said that

1403
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,599
i'm looking if you find them let me know

1404
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,760
i'd love to find that person

1405
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,680
because i wrote a book warnings about

1406
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,359
finding people who could see things in

1407
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,480
advance

1408
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,880
i have still not found the person who

1409
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,119
said the russian military is pathetic

1410
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,680
and it will fall apart if you use it

1411
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,559
um i don't think we know

1412
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,240
uh i don't think we know

1413
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,480
how long the ukrainian military can be

1414
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,680
sustained by nato

1415
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,920
and by its own people obviously i don't

1416
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,640
know

1417
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,319
how long um

1418
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,520
people in

1419
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,319
the kremlin will put up with putin

1420
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,760
i think it's very hard to get rid of

1421
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,280
them

1422
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,520
but i said that about other leaders like

1423
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,599
gaddafi and you know

1424
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,280
qaddafi ended up in the ditch so

1425
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,680
it's the right question

1426
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,760
uh and we could do all sorts of

1427
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,599
sensitivity analysis on it but basically

1428
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,359
we don't know

1429
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,680
thank you

1430
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,400
mr clark mr clark

1431
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
i'm michael clark and i've got a dumb

1432
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,640
question and i mean yes in all sincerity

1433
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
there are no dumb questions well dumb

1434
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,160
answers but

1435
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,160
give me give me a shot i might surprise

1436
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,960
you um

1437
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,280
this is not meant to be challenging this

1438
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,480
is not meant to be disrespectful i am

1439
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,839
i'm asking this in sincerity

1440
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,760
your top ten list your first one was

1441
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,160
patch patch patch i've got 34 years in

1442
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,880
the industrial automation sector

1443
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,559
i've worked for all the bigs i've never

1444
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,480
worked for a vendor i've always worked

1445
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
on the end user side of the equation and

1446
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,599
critical infrastructure

1447
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,839
they have enormous allergic reactions to

1448
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,880
patches oh i know and i would like your

1449
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,839
opinion

1450
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,480
on what is being done or how

1451
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,359
instructions are being received or sent

1452
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,720
to

1453
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,280
the very vendor who is creating the

1454
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,640
patch

1455
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,359
and why they can't get it right i've

1456
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,599
seen entire refineries brought to their

1457
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,720
knees by patching i was there and

1458
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,799
internet providers and i got a burn from

1459
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,400
the flare

1460
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,720
okay so that's that's what i'm saying is

1461
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,440
these guys are highly allergic

1462
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,559
reactions to patching so so forgive me

1463
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,720
but no no i accept price i accept that

1464
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,319
there's a reason

1465
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,240
why people only patch once a month and

1466
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,640
then they don't even do that

1467
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,760
um

1468
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,160
i get that

1469
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,799
i'm talking i i t not ot but there's a

1470
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,000
similar problem with i.t

1471
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,200
nobody wants to put a patch on a major

1472
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,559
complex corporate enterprise network

1473
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,640
without simulating it

1474
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,400
without running it in a sandbox

1475
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,799
and that takes a lot of time and money

1476
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,920
and staff

1477
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,079
and you can't be doing that

1478
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,359
all the time or you'll never be doing

1479
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,799
anything else i get that

1480
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,000
but if you can't patch to at least a

1481
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,640
workaround

1482
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,559
if the vendor says this is a high

1483
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,480
priority patch and includes a security

1484
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,280
function

1485
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,319
now if they don't tell you what the

1486
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,680
security function is that's a problem

1487
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,359
right there go back and insist that they

1488
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,960
tell you and and do it as a community

1489
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,960
but if they tell you there is a security

1490
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,079
problem being solved with this patch and

1491
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,280
you can't get to it

1492
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,200
then disable the system

1493
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,760
or build around the system

1494
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,880
isolate the system

1495
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,799
maybe you can't do that either but at

1496
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,680
least think about it

1497
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,079
because there is an alternative between

1498
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,319
saying i'm going to patch it right away

1499
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:33,839
and i'm never going to patch the damn

1500
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,078
thing

1501
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,400
there is an alternative which is build a

1502
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,160
workaround

1503
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,599
and i can't tell you how to do that

1504
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,400
because it's unique in every case

1505
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,559
it's probably easier in other than in

1506
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,119
i.t i don't

1507
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,119
for that reason know yeah

1508
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,599
well as we know um

1509
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,839
sophisticated malware now tests to see

1510
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,480
if it's in the sandbox

1511
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,079
um

1512
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,480
so there's you know we all we all

1513
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,000
started out playing in sandboxes we're

1514
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,599
all back there you know

1515
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,880
when we were three we were playing in

1516
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,480
sandboxes and fighting

1517
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,160
in sandboxes and now there's a war going

1518
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,960
on in sandboxes between malware and

1519
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,920
detection systems

1520
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,119
i realize that

1521
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,280
saying patch patch patch i don't

1522
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,599
literally mean take anything that comes

1523
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,839
in and immediately put it on

1524
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,599
but i do mean pay a lot more attention

1525
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,720
to patches that come on and say there's

1526
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,640
a security problem being solved

1527
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,359
and

1528
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,200
when that happens in the period when you

1529
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,839
are shields up

1530
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:42,960
follow-up

1531
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,559
with patching

1532
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,240
right now

1533
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,039
this is the prime time

1534
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,240
to sneak something under the radar and

1535
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,000
trusting that you've got a supplier that

1536
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,240
has vetted their patch or

1537
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,240
is getting their patch information from

1538
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,119
reliable sources that's that's a sticky

1539
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,079
wicket

1540
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,520
sticky wicket any term

1541
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,880
and that's why i suggested this is a

1542
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,839
great research topic

1543
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,400
i have yet to see

1544
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,480
a product in the market

1545
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,799
that is really reliable

1546
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,440
for looking at patches

1547
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,680
and i mean you can do all sorts of code

1548
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,160
analysis sure

1549
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,280
but

1550
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,280
most of those none of those code

1551
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,039
analysis tools that are out there are

1552
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,720
designed specifically to look at patches

1553
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,680
maybe they'll have to be you know maybe

1554
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,200
you can just take varicode and run it on

1555
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,000
everything i don't know

1556
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,960
but um

1557
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
it's a it's it's a problem that we

1558
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,280
haven't properly addressed

1559
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,680
we know there is an attack vector it's

1560
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,000
been used

1561
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,079
you would think silicon valley would be

1562
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,280
falling all over itself coming up with a

1563
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,119
new product

1564
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,760
to address that new attack vector

1565
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,119
i haven't seen it

1566
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,440
it's not sexy

1567
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,319
no

1568
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,440
