1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
good afternoon and welcome to this

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,140
week's uh episode of the serious

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,460
security Symposium from Purdue

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,680
University my great honor today to

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,139
introduce our distinguished speaker uh

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,139
Dr de pankar

7
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,240
Das Gupta who is the director of the

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
center for information assurance at the

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,500
University of Memphis

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,340
uh which is also a NSA DHS Center of

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,900
academic Excellence similar to what we

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,439
have here at Purdue with Syria so uh Dr

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,859
Des Gupta welcome to Purdue

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,399
thank you thank you for inviting me to

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,860
give this talk uh today I'm going to

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,140
talk about

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,960
adaptive multi-factor authentication and

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,800
cyber identity so before I talk about

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,340
this topic I'd like to give those who

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,940
are not familiar with my work my

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,600
background I have

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,180
let's see

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,440
this is my research I came from AI

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,860
machine learning and worked on a wide

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,619
variety of topics using different AI

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,840
machine learning and my phds in early

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,320
90s that those days the AI machine

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,900
learning had a different shape but over

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,420
the years has not changed computational

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,600
power has increased and many of these

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,759
techniques are becoming more popular

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,479
and I have more than 300 Publications

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,780
about twenty thousand uh

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,400
citations

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
and these are my published books so you

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,100
can see uh I am coming from uh you know

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,079
different kinds of AI machine learning

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,400
and

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,780
since 2000 in since 1995 I started

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,540
applying these methods to cyber security

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,040
problems so to me uh you know I look at

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,500
the cyber security areas as different

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
problem and how uh I can solve those

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
using this machine learning techniques

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,739
and these are some of my patterns and

46
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,900
awarded and submitted

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
so

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
some of uh this is the agenda I'm going

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,660
to talk about the

50
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,160
multi-factor authentication and most of

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,340
you already know about it then active

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,040
and continuous authentication what is

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
the Adaptive multi-factor authentication

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,379
that we proposed and we probably are the

55
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,840
one of the first ones we propose and

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,959
whatso

57
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,180
strategies and I'll give five minutes

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,120
demo on the Prototype system and I'll

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,620
show a new scale minute kind of

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,379
screenshots of a use case then how the

61
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,019
whole field of authentication is moving

62
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,160
to the I identity signs and their

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,900
steering committees on identity

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,780
ecosystems and there is a Fido Alliance

65
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,680
and they have a field or two aspects and

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,680
now recently you may have heard of zero

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,159
trust everything have to be in zero

68
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,680
trust so how the Zero's trust is

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
applicable in authentication and

70
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
identity management

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,659
again disclaimer this presentation is a

72
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,519
collection of information from different

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,280
sources and credits should be given to

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,519
the original contributors

75
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,120
in to my presentation is for educational

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,459
purpose only

77
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,239
so we all know that

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,260
identity verification and user

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,260
identities is very critical particularly

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,500
in remote work environment

81
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,860
since without a education

82
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,080
adequate authentication mechanism in

83
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,780
place there is an increased potential of

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,860
hacking data breach and all kinds of bad

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,860
stuff can happen there are other aspects

86
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,120
also legal liabilities so class section

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,639
lawsuit individual actions then

88
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,620
reputation exposure

89
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,759
business consequences and there are

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,639
different kinds of types of bridge costs

91
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,780
so

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,780
so you can see the

93
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,199
identity verification is the kind of

94
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,780
getting the

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,759
identity credential is the key to the

96
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,479
kingdom if that is stolen then many

97
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,780
things happen in an organization in a

98
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,020
business and there are many incidents

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,120
I'll show you one or two incident very

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
recently what is happening and then

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,340
we'll go to this specific

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,139
area so authentication uh

103
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,500
is a critical Safeguard against illegal

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,620
access to Computing system so the

105
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,620
process of giving individuals access to

106
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,139
the system objects based on their

107
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,340
identity

108
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,840
and

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,560
so important thing is that individual

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,699
who he or she or even the device saying

111
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,800
who they are that should be checked and

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,820
verified

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,520
So currently I'm identifying the

114
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,900
authorized authorized users or the

115
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,539
device in an operating environment is a

116
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,139
challenge and that's the problem that we

117
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,699
are trying to address

118
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,080
most

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,460
until now and even for a long time user

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,979
passwords uh user and passwords are

121
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,300
being used and now it is gradually

122
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,419
two-factor authentication is coming into

123
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,419
play and I'll also show that there are a

124
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,880
number of vendors who are promoting

125
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,979
multi-factor authentication and that's

126
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,020
the

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,259
topic for today's presentation

128
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,699
so final factor or user password is not

129
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,680
secure

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,419
then the second factor is coming and

131
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,539
that second Factor can be in a non

132
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,639
um obvious way not through the same

133
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,740
channel of communication uh the token or

134
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,100
OTP different ways the information is

135
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,720
shared

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,500
we did some work uh

137
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,220
with a mighty a couple of years back and

138
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,060
that tried to address this

139
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,740
password-based authentication system and

140
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,280
it was funded by ayurpa

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,960
and it's called multi-factor

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,720
authentication the concept is like this

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,319
when someone trying to access to the

144
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,960
systems or resources they they will not

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
be directly allowed to access to that

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,819
there is a filtering mechanism the

147
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,380
important thing about the filtering

148
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,479
mechanism the way the filtering is done

149
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
is a non-obvious way and that's what I'm

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,139
going to show you in next slide on

151
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,080
so we have the password profiles and we

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,300
we represent it in a representative

153
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,680
space

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,520
so uh is assumed that the profile is the

155
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,160
green part and the space the rest of the

156
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,060
areas are red then what we do we keep

157
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,280
this

158
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,819
non password areas in the front layer so

159
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,039
that's why we call it negative negative

160
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,340
authentication the concept is who you

161
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,780
are not so this is who you and this part

162
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,440
is who you are not so uh and that will

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,039
go as the security layer 1 and then this

164
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,780
is the security layer and the security

165
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,860
layer 2 are kept in a more secure uh

166
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,680
restricted environment and every now and

167
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,319
then the

168
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,880
detectors negative detectors are created

169
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
and pushed to the front line

170
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,500
so that's was used and

171
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
so this is the concept so if there is

172
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,720
any guessing password they are supposed

173
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,240
to be you know one of these red areas

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,419
and that will be dropped and go for

175
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,240
forensic investigation it will not

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
affect the

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,039
password management system that will

178
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
safeguard the

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,980
um what you call the side Channel at

180
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,100
arts or if there is any vulnerability in

181
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,140
the password system and if they so if

182
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,480
there is legitimate password is entered

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,899
or credential is entered the user will

184
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,839
not uh

185
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,399
know that they have been checked by

186
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,240
these negative filters and they will get

187
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,940
checked their second layer and access to

188
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,180
this information sources will be given

189
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,060
to them so that's the basic concept and

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,000
it was prototyped and MIT had some

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,279
launching of some of the business

192
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,160
aspects on this so what we found out

193
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,860
that negative authentication system can

194
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,839
detect and filter out most of the

195
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,300
invalid requests but again it cannot

196
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
solve all the problems the offline

197
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,720
downloading the things profile and

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,880
finding

199
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,220
that may not be able to handle but the

200
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,420
guessing attacks can be

201
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,459
defended and there are similar words has

202
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,040
been done on honey Awards and others

203
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,440
in the literature so

204
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,100
again there is a video you can find it

205
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,300
from The Source on that project so uh

206
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,779
what I was trying to highlight that the

207
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,140
concept of authentication is in our core

208
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,580
research

209
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,260
now then if we look at now uh the

210
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,779
Biometrics become more important and

211
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,640
many of our mobile devices have

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,600
biometrics so it provides the uniqueness

213
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,360
right the authentication through human

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,420
characteristics who you are the physical

215
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,920
self

216
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,740
and the question is the collectibility

217
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,220
we have to select the features uh or the

218
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,019
character which should be measurable

219
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,260
which does not have it does not change

220
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,600
that much more frequently

221
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,380
and the universibility ability to use

222
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,079
biometric system in a real time at

223
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,560
different operating environment so so

224
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,100
that's the things that Biometrics

225
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,800
provide and

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,680
there is a study International biometric

227
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,140
groups and this is a very interesting

228
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,839
study they showed that different kinds

229
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,839
of Biometrics have different degrees of

230
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,920
difficulty uh and so

231
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,079
in this chart the further you away from

232
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,700
the center

233
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,279
right the biometric techniques are much

234
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,519
better from the usability perspective so

235
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,880
they have these four criterias

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,180
intrusiveness distinctiveness cost and

237
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,519
efforts how much effort it will take to

238
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,040
get the biometric

239
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
signature or biometric area and in this

240
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,920
stage so these are the keystrokes can

241
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,360
facial scan retinals can Iris scan voice

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,600
can fingerprint scan signature scan and

243
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
hand scan so they looked into so you can

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,140
see the retinal scan in all these

245
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,339
measures are not that good because it it

246
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,620
is more intrusive

247
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,899
uh distinctiveness is good

248
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,720
but it is costly and it takes a lot of

249
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,200
effort to take the picture of the retina

250
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,320
facial recognition is goes in a so in an

251
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,380
ideal environment for the biometric uh

252
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,980
the though we have to find it out which

253
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,519
has far from the center so that's the

254
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,640
study and we use some of the measures in

255
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,380
our uh trust over the measurement uh and

256
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,540
I'm going to get to that later

257
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,600
so

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,220
depending only on the face recognition

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,079
uh is not a solution because uh as we

260
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,779
all know digitally manipulated phase

261
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,940
videos and image all can be

262
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,060
this can deceive the system in automatic

263
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,120
Trace recognition system based on this

264
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,820
phase biometric or phrase recognition

265
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,519
The Mask which was created for movies

266
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,120
and other entertainment

267
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,139
are used to discuss the

268
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,480
sensory system or cameras to rob banks

269
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,279
and any other areas there are a number

270
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,720
of incidents

271
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,980
so

272
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,579
and you can see these are real faces

273
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,100
fake faces can be created with a

274
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,260
different kinds of gesture different

275
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,839
color changes and all these things are

276
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,540
possible now nowadays there is an app

277
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,060
and many of those are there face app is

278
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,940
one of those that can change human face

279
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,480
to changing gender changing color all

280
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,720
kinds of things are possible so

281
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,860
and creating this Faith also gone

282
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,079
further

283
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,920
which makes this called Deep fake uh

284
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,579
misclassification so the original image

285
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:15,959
can be changed within with not with tiny

286
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,380
noise and in this case random noise you

287
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,260
have phase changes

288
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,139
so and

289
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,060
so and there are ways to detect and even

290
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,220
uh your

291
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,980
nist has some competence and other uh

292
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,100
fake face created by AI looks more like

293
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,920
a trustworthy than real faces but these

294
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,579
are all using

295
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,240
nit adversial Network again

296
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,720
so the point here is the face

297
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,240
recognition

298
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,019
is not

299
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,899
cannot be only used as a authentication

300
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,980
mechanism or factor and here is the news

301
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,980
where it says that the police testing

302
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,220
imagines phase recognition tune whether

303
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,339
it gives a correct information and also

304
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,980
list has a competition where you can say

305
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,860
the forensic

306
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,320
investigation to automatically detect

307
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,279
locate manipulation of defects

308
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,420
so the media forensic competition or

309
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,500
challenges

310
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,800
the that's and they have number of

311
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,519
examples that people can use to test

312
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,740
their system

313
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,060
so

314
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,880
so what it has been realized that that

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,579
different environment the different

316
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,339
kinds of authentication model it is have

317
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,060
to be selected in traditionally if

318
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,279
someone uses the wear machine or

319
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,459
Wireless cellular

320
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,800
the same pattern of connection in this

321
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
case example is to the bank are used but

322
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,240
that that

323
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,360
same connection or the authentication

324
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,380
pattern can be compromised an identity

325
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,860
can be tapped in this diagram it shows

326
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,800
that wireless connection word connection

327
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
tablets device

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
and media changes still using the same

329
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,940
authentication credibility

330
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,480
so so we know there are many modalities

331
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,779
are out there uh apart from what you

332
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,800
know that is the password pin and what

333
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,959
the user has

334
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,980
different kinds of information where the

335
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,040
user is and who the user is that's a

336
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,860
biometric and a multi-factor

337
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,740
authentication use two or more of this

338
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,360
model it is a current practices

339
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
so

340
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,699
these are different products in

341
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,839
multi-factor in the market and I put the

342
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,720
their website links and they are

343
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,199
capacity on multi-factor these are

344
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,400
Duo security many of us use the Dual

345
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,859
Security in our University and

346
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,280
organization OCTA is another big player

347
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,700
in multi-factor authentication

348
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,000
and this is these are different vendors

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,520
and what how many factors they use and

350
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,940
how many factors register and these are

351
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,580
all listed here and their features are

352
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,059
and the website so this is uh the

353
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,620
Microsoft Azura where user login from

354
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,340
any device using their existing

355
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,860
username and password and that's how

356
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,280
they then create other credential

357
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,220
and store in the cloud and whenever they

358
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,700
want to access it the first factor and

359
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,480
the second factor used from the

360
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,160
registered one so

361
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,600
what happened recently you may know that

362
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,400
last six months news that

363
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
the number of multi-factor

364
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
authentication systems are being hacked

365
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,140
and ironically as or as the you know

366
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,520
report that a group of teenagers

367
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,740
lapis group

368
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,840
it seems they are using different social

369
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,260
engineering attacks and they compromise

370
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,640
the multi-factor authentication for Uber

371
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,679
and they also did it for many of the

372
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,780
companies

373
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,799
multi-factor authentication systems so

374
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,960
they bypassed again many cases the the

375
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,240
all the details are not available

376
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:21,970
[Music]

377
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,599
[Music]

378
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,720
[Music]

379
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,660
what are holding attack or putting a

380
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,360
part where the the victim put their

381
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,179
second factor and that's how they got

382
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,539
the information and this is a you can

383
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,780
see this is very recent news and

384
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,940
investigate and started in different

385
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,320
companies they

386
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,620
this one with the

387
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,760
with the

388
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,220
January the octave was hacked and then

389
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,640
subsequently other things were reported

390
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,559
so let's see this is the OCTA used by

391
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,760
many companies and those were affected

392
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,740
and that was in January 2022.

393
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,120
so question here is that even someone

394
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,539
has a multiple factors

395
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:42,840
that may not be provide enough security

396
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,640
so modality selection should not follow

397
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,299
any fixed pattern so you will have

398
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,919
password followed by OTP so it is we

399
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,480
call it the fixed pattern

400
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,400
should be

401
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,580
unpredictable that's where the uh

402
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,640
you know our work I'm saying it should

403
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,940
be unpredictable what is coming next how

404
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,640
the user will be authenticated is not

405
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,640
known even to the user

406
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,500
so

407
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,080
so the process should make consideration

408
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
of previous selection of authentication

409
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,900
factors to avoid repeatedly use of the

410
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,720
same authentication factor and that can

411
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,659
be done so far most of the companies are

412
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,820
doing these static multi-factor

413
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,220
authentication though they claim that

414
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,620
they are doing

415
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,679
in some cases some companies they say we

416
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
use Dynamic multi-factor Authentication

417
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,100
some also claim they use adaptive

418
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,220
multi-factor authentication

419
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,299
but how they do the adaptiveness that's

420
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,419
not clear it is not um

421
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,200
you know reported so here if you make it

422
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,720
adaptive either static is doesn't work

423
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,780
and we have seen uh still hacking is

424
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,360
going Dynamic has two form you can

425
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,700
randomly select the authentication

426
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,539
factors but those may not be available

427
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,360
for certain device or certain

428
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,539
environment and random also can bring

429
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,000
sometimes reputation if you don't have

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,679
enough possible factors so adaptive is a

431
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,580
calculated way it's a guided search

432
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,700
which can provide better answer with

433
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,980
some kvn and I'm going to talk about

434
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,280
those constraints that how that is

435
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,600
possible so we started our project was

436
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,860
funded by a federal agency and

437
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,059
it the idea was to greatly enhance the

438
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,120
security without changing the user

439
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,700
experience

440
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,460
however when an unauthorized user

441
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,400
attempts to gain access to with stolen

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
credential and and the additional

443
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,179
factors and behaviors normally seen does

444
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,140
not line up so we need to watch that as

445
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,600
a continuous authentication process

446
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
so selection of multiple factors are

447
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,020
considered adapt conducted adaptively

448
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,559
considering the operating device

449
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,900
and the environment where the user is

450
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,100
working and the way they are connected

451
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,440
and the surrounding conditions and I'll

452
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,840
illustrate this what I mean by this in

453
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,080
this way so suppose you have five

454
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,659
factors face recognition fingerprint

455
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,260
voice recognition past

456
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,280
and SMS so it's a tiny set but this

457
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,260
illustration will make

458
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,360
now if

459
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
if it is a noisy environment the speaker

460
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,299
is on then voice recognition will not be

461
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,520
used so he keeps track of the

462
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,880
environment that we are in uh before

463
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,500
selecting the

464
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,520
often here if they if they

465
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,980
if it is a

466
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,740
low illumination area low light area

467
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,020
then the face recognition will not be

468
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,419
used because it may not give the correct

469
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:33,980
uh answer so and similarly both are uh

470
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,380
noisy and the

471
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,440
and the low light area then those will

472
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,780
not be con considered now the question

473
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,960
immediately people say oh then the

474
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,600
hacker will create an environment so you

475
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
that the number of factors will be

476
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,940
eliminated so that you have a reduced

477
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,220
number of factors and which can be

478
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,539
compromised easily so it become now uh a

479
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,039
pattern fixed pattern so to answer that

480
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,120
I when a simple scenario now considering

481
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,299
today's environment you have hundreds of

482
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,799
different

483
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,480
um

484
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,620
authentication factors

485
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,260
some are you have to actively involve

486
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,380
some of the passively monitored and

487
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,559
that's how the balance have to be done

488
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,980
to address this breaking the pattern

489
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,260
so uh

490
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,440
in this example this side it gives

491
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,659
different authentication factors that

492
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,520
are available face recognition login

493
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,059
capture SMS fingerprint voice

494
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,539
recognition keystroke at once this is

495
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,279
the application domain uh we worked on

496
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,740
with 30 participants on online course

497
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,940
and on that online courses we are also

498
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,100
the famous

499
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,720
designated Center for our developing

500
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,179
cyber security online courses so some of

501
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,179
the courses we tested with the pilots so

502
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,700
uh on that environment

503
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,620
so here

504
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,260
I don't know this why this is showing up

505
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,020
so so we used

506
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,460
um

507
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,039
uh

508
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,200
the different device changing different

509
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,520
device

510
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,400
changing different media where wireless

511
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,580
cellular so and the effect of the

512
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,100
surrounding and different modalities are

513
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,860
stored in the backend server or multiple

514
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,400
server as the system our contribution is

515
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,500
the

516
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,400
selection adaptive selection of multiple

517
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,620
authentication factors so it's

518
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,080
considering the situation it selected

519
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,360
face recognition and fingerprinting will

520
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,120
be used so somebody have to put the face

521
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,880
and put the thumb to for the finger

522
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,240
screen but both are active

523
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,919
authentication

524
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,340
in this case

525
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,760
so so the whole problem is

526
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,880
I'm going now little bit on the

527
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
technical aspects on what kind of

528
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
machine learning Technique we use and

529
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,419
how that was

530
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:30,840
considered uh the dynamic selection with

531
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,100
with the guided search so we have

532
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,480
we have the four objectives

533
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,640
and we considered different objectives

534
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,460
this is the trust model consider the

535
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,640
different factors which will be selected

536
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,539
how much you can trust on certain in in

537
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,419
a weird connection certain factors are

538
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,240
more trustworthy than other factors and

539
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,659
then the selection of factors given the

540
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,419
environment and what environment they

541
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,100
are and then the the user experience and

542
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,820
the other factors so we used multi well

543
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,820
multi-objective optimization and those

544
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,880
objectives are fed uh to come up with a

545
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,500
solution

546
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,340
so a different objectives are fed uh and

547
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,500
considered as a multi-objective

548
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,740
optimization problem then we used a

549
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,380
method called evolutionary computation

550
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,559
or genetic algorithm where it's a

551
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,299
population of

552
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,000
candidate Solutions in this case the

553
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,279
candidate Solutions are what are the

554
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,559
possible factors can be used under

555
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,360
current situation

556
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,020
then it will decide

557
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,480
evaluate it and come up with a subset of

558
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,059
solutions we call it period optimal

559
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,279
solution and then spiritual Optimal

560
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,580
Solutions I will select one of them this

561
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,700
time another so all these Solutions are

562
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,340
good in current making current decision

563
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,760
but the ones which are in the middle we

564
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,059
can choose one of those but not the same

565
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,059
every time and this a period of Primal

566
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,860
Solutions will change with the

567
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,960
environment with the device you use with

568
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
the with all other conditions that we

569
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,919
talked about

570
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,159
so then we did some stress test as I

571
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,679
said with probability

572
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,100
so surrounding condition was at a

573
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,299
different two-factor based

574
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,039
authentication three Factor base and

575
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,460
with the data sets we found that with

576
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,980
full light and

577
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,580
sound system was recognition and face

578
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,899
recognition here uh these are

579
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:52,559
voice recognition was disabled here low

580
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,140
light environment both so the test was

581
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,500
done and to perform to examine the

582
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,360
the performance of the system and

583
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,960
there are as the because it is not a

584
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,360
one-time authentication it is a

585
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,899
continuous authentication so but in a

586
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,020
discrete time so T1 at the triggering

587
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,720
time the what happened that user already

588
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,059
decided every two hour or every three

589
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,580
hours I should be authenticated that's

590
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,679
the parameter that a user can choose

591
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,200
during the registration or at later time

592
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,620
so the time has elapsed so the now user

593
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,419
will be authenticated by password and

594
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,399
capture

595
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,120
then the device changed earlier the user

596
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
was using a fixed Lan connection now

597
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,299
they moved to the mobile device so the

598
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,120
device device has changed so then there

599
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,460
will be authentication and assume that

600
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,200
the connection is a persistent

601
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,659
connection the user is still connected

602
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,600
to their service or the whatever that

603
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,140
they were connected to online but these

604
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,960
checks are happening

605
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,360
during this one is Media chain where to

606
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,000
wireless this is a device change and

607
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,559
again media change so as the time passed

608
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,919
on different triggering time this will

609
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,399
be the the

610
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,620
user will be authenticated this is a

611
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,059
discrete continuous authentication uh

612
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,580
with different triggering events

613
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,260
I'll give you a a few minutes demo of

614
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,980
how we built it so then I can I'll come

615
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,500
back to this presentation

616
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,059
um let's see

617
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,980
hello everyone University of Memphis

618
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,240
Center for information assurance

619
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,399
research team has developed a novel

620
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,620
multi-factor authentication prototype

621
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,960
the Adaptive multi-factor authentication

622
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,480
framework identifies authorized users

623
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
through an active authentication process

624
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,520
using passwords Biometrics cognitive

625
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,679
behaviors and other factors

626
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,840
authentication factors are selected

627
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
adaptively by sensing the user's

628
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,039
operating environment this includes

629
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,140
connected devices communication media

630
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,880
and surrounding conditions previously

631
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,100
selected authentication factors are also

632
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,200
considered the novel aspect of the

633
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,120
invention lies in the design of an

634
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,159
algorithm that determines the optimal

635
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,020
modalities given the user's operating

636
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,460
environment and previously used

637
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,799
modalities the MFA system uses both

638
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,360
biometric and non-biometric

639
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,700
authentication modalities our prototype

640
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,460
includes keystroke voice face and

641
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,860
fingerprint Biometrics as well as the

642
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,360
standard password and passphrase

643
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
modalities no biometric data is stored

644
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,740
on the client device in addition to

645
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,080
these out-of-band modalities such as SMS

646
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,600
and time-based one-time passwords are

647
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,100
supported through the use of mobile

648
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,500
devices the client application captures

649
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,440
the ambient light noise and location to

650
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,880
determine the user's surrounding

651
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,039
conditions the network information is

652
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,720
used to determine the type of device

653
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,480
being used fixed or portable and the

654
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,000
connection type via ethernet Wi-Fi or

655
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,399
cellular this information is used to

656
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:06,779
differentiate between multiple

657
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,120
connections of the same user all of the

658
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,980
information collected is passed to the

659
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,659
server over a secure encrypted

660
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,580
connection the server will process the

661
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,440
information and return a response

662
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,480
directly to the client if the SMS

663
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
modality is chosen the server sends a

664
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
password to the user's registered mobile

665
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,419
device for the time-based one-time

666
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,760
password a secret is shared with the

667
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,159
client during registration after this

668
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,559
point no communication is required to be

669
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,299
made with a phone in order to use

670
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,460
one-time password as a part of user

671
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,740
statistics each connection request is

672
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,200
logged in the database raw biometric

673
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,659
data sent by the user must pass through

674
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,360
a feature extraction phase the relevant

675
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,399
features are collected and stored in a

676
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,620
template only templates never raw

677
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,659
biometric data are stored in the

678
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,340
database when a client submits an

679
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,019
authentication request the server will

680
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,820
execute a selection algorithm that

681
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,260
evaluates the user's surrounding

682
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,720
conditions and the previously chosen set

683
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,480
of modalities to select a new optimal

684
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,700
set of authentication modalities the

685
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,620
selected modalities are returned as a

686
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,418
challenge to the user after the user

687
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,099
responds to the authentication challenge

688
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,260
the features are extracted from the

689
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,839
responding biometric data these features

690
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,760
are matched against the target features

691
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,440
which are retrieved from the database

692
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
based on the match result the server

693
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,399
will successfully authenticate the user

694
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,560
or decline the attempt this shows the

695
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
overall system and how the client and

696
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,760
server components are connected next we

697
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,679
have a demonstration of the software we

698
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,239
have prototyped this is the welcome

699
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,179
screen for the Adaptive MFA system to

700
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,399
begin the user is prompted to enter a

701
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,320
valid email address if the email address

702
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,780
does not exist in the system the user is

703
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,000
prompted to begin registration the first

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,199
page prompts for the personal

705
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,359
information of the user note that the

706
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,520
information on this page is all that

707
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,320
most authentication systems require

708
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,719
because the registration process can be

709
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,240
lengthy our prototype allows the user to

710
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,220
partially register their account so they

711
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,780
don't have to complete the entire

712
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,240
registration in one sitting furthermore

713
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,400
this allows the system to be configured

714
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,980
to use varying levels of security for

715
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,680
different users or user groups next the

716
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,180
user must enter their cellular

717
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,220
information in order to bind their

718
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,500
cellular phone to their account to

719
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,780
confirm the phone number is valid an SMS

720
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,000
message containing a six-digit code will

721
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,040
be sent to the phone the user then

722
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,440
enters and submits the code to set up

723
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,000
the time-based one-time password

724
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,820
modality we use a mobile app to scan the

725
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,099
QR code that was generated by the server

726
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,740
and contains a shared secret key the

727
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,660
mobile app automatically generates a new

728
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,000
code every 30 seconds the user must

729
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,680
enter and submit the displayed code

730
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,839
within the 30 second window for our

731
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,240
biometric algorithms our system uses

732
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,740
machine learning techniques to better

733
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,380
learn and identify the users as more

734
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,599
samples are given the more accurate it

735
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,579
becomes now we begin registering

736
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,619
biometric modalities here are the

737
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,660
keystroke timing information is recorded

738
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,760
you can see these times posted on the

739
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,140
screen but these are not normally

740
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,420
visible to the user here a connected

741
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,880
webcam captures 10 facial images which

742
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,680
are then sent to the server for feature

743
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,960
extraction on this page we record the

744
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,720
user's voice speaking the phrase

745
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,520
multi-factor authentication in order to

746
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,680
build an audio biometric profile for the

747
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,200
user for all Biometrics we take several

748
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,240
recordings in order to develop a more

749
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,700
robust model for the user lastly a

750
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,500
fingerprint scanner is used to obtain

751
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,420
three fingerprint images from the user

752
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,220
this final page is an under the hood

753
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,020
view of the sensors being read to the

754
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,660
screen normally it isn't visible but it

755
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,220
shows the ambient light and sound

756
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,200
conditions for this room these are used

757
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
in order to adaptively influence the

758
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
modalities that will be selected during

759
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,320
the authentication phase to gather the

760
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,300
surrounding conditions we is an Arduino

761
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,339
Mega microcontroller with light and

762
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,320
sound sensors fitted in the customized

763
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,839
3D printed case to begin authentication

764
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,119
we return to the welcome screen this

765
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,859
time when the user enters the email

766
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,839
address a selection of modalities are

767
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,880
given to be used to authenticate to the

768
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,619
system for the first authentication

769
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,960
attempt face recognition keystroke

770
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,420
analysis and password where the modality

771
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,040
selected by the system for the

772
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,079
authentication phase fewer samples are

773
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,700
required for extraction than were

774
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,619
collected in the registration phase for

775
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,480
the second authentication attempt the

776
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,280
system has selected the fingerprint and

777
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,800
passphrase modalities it is worth noting

778
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,260
that multiple algorithms may be used for

779
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,820
each modality during a single

780
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,980
authentication attempt in this case the

781
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,900
fingerprint provided is being processed

782
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,099
through two algorithms for

783
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,140
authentication coupled with passphrase

784
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,820
this brings us to three modalities

785
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,980
actually being authenticated even though

786
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,280
only two were prompted so

787
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,859
that that's the

788
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:47,220
the basic idea so can you hear me

789
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,260
yes yes okay

790
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,579
so

791
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,579
um

792
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,960
going back to my

793
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,380
presentation so this is how uh the MFA

794
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,400
adaptive MFA so you can see it's a

795
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,280
continuous identity

796
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,520
protection and not Square always on

797
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,520
ensuring the user identity as long as

798
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,200
they are connected to the system or

799
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,020
service it can provide it's a

800
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,400
cloud-based

801
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,680
identity management

802
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,980
because the server will push to the

803
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,040
client how the person have to be

804
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,060
authenticated and it can be Federated IT

805
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,520
need not have to be in a one server it

806
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,859
can be very different authentication

807
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,359
Factor uh can come from different places

808
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,940
so the server if one server get

809
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,579
compromised the others are still there

810
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,060
the selection algorithm that's the key

811
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,640
factor that is the

812
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,300
just in time decision so most of the

813
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,460
that's what I personally feel and again

814
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,119
someone can verify I personally feel

815
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,160
most of the multi-factor authentication

816
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,220
that are out there they are not just in

817
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,780
time decisions

818
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,359
in this case

819
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,359
user the server will not know how the

820
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,640
person will be authenticated at the

821
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,960
triggering time

822
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,720
that will be determined by the algorithm

823
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,480
based on the consideration the

824
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,640
environment the device in in the connect

825
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,200
and then the decision will be made and

826
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,320
which will be pushed to the client

827
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,800
to authenticate

828
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,540
and there we use this machine learning

829
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,900
technique which is a kind of guided

830
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,579
search and which will search the space

831
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:50,700
and that will determine so what it is

832
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
bringing it is bringing the

833
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,380
unpredictability what is coming next to

834
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,200
authentication that unpredictability it

835
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,000
is bringing and if we have the

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,099
authentication factors large number of

837
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,440
things that

838
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,020
I'm going to show it and it has a broad

839
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,240
areas of applications

840
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,300
the factors as you get in new factors

841
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,180
for authenticating can add into it so

842
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,760
this is a the patent which you got in

843
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,540
2018 and this is a company who licensed

844
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,160
it and they are working on different

845
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,040
application domain particularly I feel

846
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,579
this it can be deployed at different

847
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,820
levels application Level

848
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,700
you can see at the at the user level

849
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,400
root user administrative is a guest user

850
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
so administrative user will help you

851
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,680
more rigorously authenticated than the

852
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,520
guest user and at the document level we

853
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,660
as we always get the PDF with encryption

854
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,980
but if you see that kind of sorry uh

855
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,460
with a password protected or that give

856
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,960
your first five letters of your name by

857
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,260
your uh four letters or forward numbers

858
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,420
of social security number or something

859
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,460
which is fixed

860
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,460
and anybody who do some social engine

861
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,300
they will be able to find out

862
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,640
data path or last four digit of the

863
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,859
social security number or anything so

864
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:26,040
that fixed type of uh you know

865
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,140
authentication is not secure so we can

866
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,020
use deep

867
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,820
factors every time differently for

868
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,040
Authentication

869
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,880
the system runs in three different modes

870
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,720
the in a normal mode if the user so it

871
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,500
is a part of continuous authentication

872
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,480
it will trigger specific authentication

873
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,260
factors that are uh core application

874
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,280
factors and it will trigger as changes

875
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,000
from where to wireless or any media

876
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,060
change or the threshold time threshold

877
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,720
is over or the device change then it

878
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,980
will work in a Vigilant mode if one of

879
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,560
the authentication Factor was not been

880
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,440
triggered because of the environment is

881
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,440
low light area or there's a noisy

882
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,980
environment then more passive

883
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,020
authentications will be considered and

884
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,060
then the triggering time will get

885
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,140
shorter

886
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,500
when it goes to the surveillance mode

887
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,460
when that when if it is

888
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,240
if it

889
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,400
are not considered

890
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,820
during the selection process then the

891
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,800
space will be enlarged

892
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,079
in other words a lot of other

893
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,079
authentication factors will be

894
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,200
considered and in our version 2 we

895
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
consider the number of other information

896
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,680
from the mobile devices which was

897
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,800
primarily for mobile device or

898
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,220
authentication using the and that's the

899
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,480
expansion and now there are more uh you

900
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,819
know behavioral and aspects are there

901
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,599
like GPS location camera

902
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,900
and all the gyroscope walking pattern

903
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,420
and all this can be captured as

904
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,060
different modalities for user

905
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,599
authentication now

906
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,160
I'll let me see I'll finish with um

907
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,760
with a few other things there is a nice

908
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,579
work since our work been published that

909
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,760
the adaptation can be can happen at a

910
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,339
different levels not only the three

911
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:54,599
things we consider but the the they

912
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,460
followed our work and they said the

913
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,220
authentication and adaptation can happen

914
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,579
at a multiple level in other words you

915
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,859
can see change in Technical Resources

916
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,800
the reason for

917
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,339
self-adaptation so

918
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:13,740
yes we have about five minutes left

919
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,060
okay so so this adaptation can happen in

920
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,280
at a different level and these are

921
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,060
further expansion of the when to adopt

922
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,540
and how to adapt and that's a good area

923
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,500
to look into now I'll finish with the

924
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,599
slide this there is an identity

925
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,060
ecosystem and

926
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,380
um

927
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,339
and the areas that now is more important

928
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:45,260
what we are working on how this

929
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,020
adaptive multi-factor can address the

930
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,680
zero trust architecture that is federal

931
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,099
government is pushing for zero trust so

932
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,160
it it assumes the bridge and verify

933
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,160
every step on the way how people Access

934
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,680
Data whether it is through an

935
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,560
application or a device so regardless of

936
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,260
whether the request originated or what

937
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,440
resources uh it access zero trust

938
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,339
teaches us never trust always verify and

939
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,079
that's where the Adaptive multi-factor

940
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,680
and you can see there is a con

941
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,400
Consortium of called fido2 they are

942
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,380
using hardware token that is attestation

943
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,839
of the device

944
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,380
and also Imagine segmaker

945
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,260
have similar Concepts so with that I'll

946
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,339
like to stop and you know you answer any

947
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,900
question

948
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,599
wonderful we do have a question in the Q

949
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,819
a and if there are any additional

950
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,319
attendees who would like to pose a

951
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,300
question please drop it in the Q a

952
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,460
feature down below so the question is

953
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,599
with regards to NAS

954
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,339
wouldn't the negative filter be

955
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,819
exponentially massive suppose you Hash a

956
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:07,020
password into an N bit string a negative

957
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,859
filter have to store 2 to the nth minus

958
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:14,060
one values to reject that sounds quite

959
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,579
computationally expensive I think the

960
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,300
course is a very valid question and we

961
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,040
address this using a deterministic

962
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,260
mapping because that's we are talking

963
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,900
about the space binary space

964
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,020
and Beauty with the representation you

965
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:39,060
can you can reduce the uh you can use

966
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,180
convex or concave increasing the space

967
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,300
or reducing the space so it is all the

968
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,599
mapping function how you map map that

969
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,780
binary space to a space so we used

970
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,440
called deterministic metrics so we use

971
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,619
the banish space to a two-dimensional uh

972
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:04,880
metrics and different segments

973
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,160
considered as the cluster of points so

974
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,340
our publication I think it was in

975
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,839
[Music]

976
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,000
2018 publication with the entire group

977
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,700
worked on that it's called

978
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,260
deterministic negative selection

979
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,920
algorithm that was used which bounded

980
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,560
the space

981
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,680
remapping it to a cluster of points

982
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,700
that's a very good question yes

983
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,160
but in multi-factor negative

984
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,900
authentication can be a one of the

985
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,319
factor

986
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,859
anything else

987
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,560
great well with that we are just over

988
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,380
our class time period I appreciate and

989
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,819
thank all of the uh the attendees and a

990
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,920
special thank you to our presenter today

991
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,380
Dr gupt it was a pleasure virtually

992
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,720
hosting you here at Purdue University we

993
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,060
hope to see you again soon please tune

994
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,220
in next week for another live serious

995
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,460
security seminar uh or check out our

996
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,920
YouTube and web the serious website for

997
