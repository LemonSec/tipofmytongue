1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
all right well let me let me welcome uh

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,560
all the attendees to our security

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,879
seminar uh this week

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,920
we once again are fortunate to have

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
a really distinguished speaker to uh

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,799
present to all of you

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,840
um i've known our speaker bob gurley for

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,439
over a decade

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,680
um and he has a long career

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,279
in the field

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,199
including serving for a while as the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,119
chief technology officer

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
of the defense intelligence agency

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,719
which

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
you may or may not know about

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,079
but it is one of the major intelligence

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,360
agencies in the u.s government

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,320
and

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,920
chief technology officer is certainly an

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
important role there but he's done much

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
more than that he's run consultancies

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
he's uh a speaker on the

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
the circuit in very many many places yes

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
strategist and analyst uh that many seek

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
out for his opinion

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
uh he recently is part of starting up an

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
organization called uda

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,600
which is uh based on the ooda loop

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
concept and if you're not familiar with

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
that you can look it up on wikipedia

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
but it's basically for strategic

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,159
intelligence in cyber and security

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
generally

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,000
and it's uh i hope it's off to a very

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
successful start bob

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
but today he's going to be talking to us

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
about a big theme defending the

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
metaverse from the fearsome five threats

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
so he'll be telling us about both the

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
metaverse and what those fearsome five

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,040
threats are

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
uh when you have questions please post

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,680
them in the q a and you'll get to them

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
either during or after his talk

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,240
so without further ado

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,200
bob

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,799
please enlighten us

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
well thanks staff and i really

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
appreciate that a very kind introduction

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
i wanted to say um that i started my

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
cyber security career

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
uh well i started defending information

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
from 1982 when i became a navy

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
intelligence officer but i really

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
started my cyber security career when i

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
was helping the department of defense

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,720
defend their computers and networks at

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
jtf cnd joint task force computer

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
network defense

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
in late 1998

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
and so in doing that we had to learn

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
quick a lot of things by the experts

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
who'd come before us and that included

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
learning from staff

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
was critically helpful being able to

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
learn from staff and

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
learn the many things he was teaching

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
others also the things he was saying to

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
congress and others in the executive

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
branch including congressional testimony

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
where he defined what a secure computer

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
is and i hope that that is one thing

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,440
that everybody is taking away from your

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
education today the definition of a

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,519
secure computer uh in spas words because

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
it really resonated with me and ever

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,560
since then i have never talked about

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
computer security the same way i talk

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
about reducing risk and becoming

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
resilient

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
but in starting this off i wanted to say

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
something that spaff missed from my bio

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
that i'm most proud of

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,400
is i'm a continual learner i love to

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
learn

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,239
new technologies new approaches new

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
defensive methods

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
new ways of analyzing information and if

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
you're in the cyber security space

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,519
there's always something to learn

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
and i also wanted to say this i don't

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
want this to sound too gloomy i also

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,319
learned from my mistakes and there's

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,319
been a lot of mistakes

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
and some of my mistakes

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
were huge and some of them were

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
collective big large scale mistakes that

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
a whole generation of people made and if

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
i think if we can examine some of those

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
in this brief it may help us think

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720
through how to better defend in the

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
future

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
so with that i want to start with a

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
quote

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
listen to this i think it's good context

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
for what we're going to talk about

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
it's a letter and the letter starts

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,439
i have the desire to do what is good but

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
i cannot carry it out

110
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
for i do not do the good i want to do

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
but the evil i do not want to do

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
uh that letter was uh from over 2 000

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,199
years ago

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
it's from saint paul in his uh letters

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
the romans but i mentioned that because

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,280
i feel similar things about the internet

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
we never wanted the internet to be evil

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
all of us in the early days were

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,040
thinking this is a true force for good

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
it's going to push back on the dictators

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
and push back on the communists and

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
information wants to be free and it's

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
going to help all of us be more free

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
and i think the internet is a good thing

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
i'm really an optimist and i love it but

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
it did far more evil than i want than we

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
wanted

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
and i want you to keep that in mind as

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
we talk about the future of the

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
metaverse so with that let me get into

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,280
it here and i'll tell you what i mean up

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,919
front um about the metaverse we think of

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
the metaverse as the next wave of

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
internet technologies there have been

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
three waves and i'll talk about those in

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
a little more detail on the next slide

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
but this coming wave

138
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,479
i wanted to underscore

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
there's no indication it's going to be

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
any more secure than the previous two

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
waves so keep that in mind

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
we need it to be secure and it's not

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,800
um there it can be more secure if we as

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
the cyber security community get more

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
involved i'm sure of that so part of the

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
purpose of this brief is to capture the

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
essence of the metaverse what it's going

148
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
to be and then we can start a dialogue

149
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
on how to secure it

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,440
now what are these three waves of the

151
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
internet

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
think of the first wave as that

153
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
beginning internet it's interoperable

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
computers an interoperable comms

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
protocol it's the the killer app was

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,520
email

157
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
but also web pages

158
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
web browsers where you can click and go

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
from one link to another

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
there was the establishment in the first

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
wave of e-commerce sites where you could

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,560
buy things and shop from home at least a

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
little bit

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
and then companies were building web

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
apps for the first time where you could

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
use the internet and then interact with

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
the business uh

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
in some ways this first wave was almost

169
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
100 percent

170
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
fixed line communications either

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
copper cable or a phone line or

172
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
sometimes fiber optic if you're lucky

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
but it's mostly it's fixed line

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
communications in that first wave

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
we still live with a lot of the first

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
wave today uh the pc's on your desk the

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
a lot of hardwired systems

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
all of the e-commerce didn't go away

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
it's been modernized but we're still

180
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
living with the first wave and of course

181
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,479
email

182
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
will probably always be with us but the

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
second wave was really a revolution and

184
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
the second wave of computing let's i

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
mean of the internet

186
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
from about 2010

187
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
until today

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
was the mobile revolution so

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
because there was uh cell data and

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
advanced wi-fi and other mobile coms

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
there could be high data rate to

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
smartphones and with the regular phones

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,599
but then smartphones also and tablets

194
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,240
and laptops and it really did make a

195
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,800
difference along with this second wave

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
came this

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
massive need to move a video and

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
pictures that everybody was taking with

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
their mobile devices

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
so streaming midi media was part of the

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,639
second wave as was the internet of

202
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,599
things

203
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,800
and the second wave as you can imagine

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
still

205
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
relied on interoperable communications

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
but increasingly this was via very smart

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
well-designed cell communications that

208
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
could deliver high bandwidth streaming

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
video to a mobile device

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but also wi-fi

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
especially the

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,479
secure

213
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
wi-fi for enterprises

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
now we're starting to move into the

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
third wave all of the second wave is

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
also here with us but the third wave is

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
this thing that people are calling the

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
metaverse it's a shared

219
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,639
interoperable virtual world where

220
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,520
there's a trust layer for store of value

221
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,720
and there's persistence for your actions

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
so this user persistence will give you

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
new capabilities

224
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,919
online in these virtual worlds so it's

225
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
not just the

226
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,760
the first two waves of the internet it

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
is those but also now an ability to be

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
in the internet

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,760
that's what i think of as the context

230
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
for this metaverse

231
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
um another point now is um this is a

232
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
very dynamic area

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,880
and if someone asks you for a specific

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
definition of the metaverse uh don't pin

235
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
yourself down i think that's going to

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,240
evolve because this is a very dynamic

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
and chaotic a period

238
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
but we can't frame it and kind of say

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
what this thing seems to be

240
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
um

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,519
broadly

242
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,920
the metaverse is a massive

243
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
infinitely scalable

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
shared virtual world

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,519
where land and buildings bots avatars

246
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
and other property can be bought and

247
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,080
sold and persist

248
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
i think of it as a future computing

249
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
environment the metaverse is not here

250
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,839
today

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
but we're seeing hints of what the

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
metaverse will be if you and i have a

253
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
slide coming up in just a second that

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
shows some of what uh

255
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
current metaverse capabilities look like

256
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
um but you think of all of this uh

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
current stuff converged and

258
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
interoperable and interconnected

259
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,880
and all of that being easy to exchange

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
interoperable value across

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,399
if you want an example of what this

262
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,079
could be like you can turn to science

263
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
fiction the term metaverse came out of

264
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
science fiction um snow crash was a very

265
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,839
famous science fiction novel that

266
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
motivated a lot of us in the 90s because

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
it was very forward-looking and frankly

268
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
painted a dystopian picture of a future

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
world that we do not want

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,079
but it motivated us to build a better

271
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
idea of a metaverse

272
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
but the term metaverse did come from

273
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
this book snow crash

274
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
and you can also turn to science fiction

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
movies like uh the book

276
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
ready player one and the movie ready

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,920
player one gives a fantastic glimpse of

278
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
what could be coming um in the metaverse

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
now i mentioned

280
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
it's not here yet but it's clearly

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
coming and we have seen hints of what

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
this is already of course we all saw uh

283
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,320
in the summer of 2021

284
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,079
uh mark zuckerberg declared that

285
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,880
facebook is a metaverse company and he

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
changed the name of his company to meta

287
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
and that brings a lot of attention to

288
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
this and it says uh really that

289
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
something big is coming i don't mind

290
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
telling you however that a lot of us are

291
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,519
saying

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
we don't really want facebook defining

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,079
the future of the metaverse

294
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
for a lot of reasons that's my opinion

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
anyway but still it is coming

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
hints of what the metaverse is i list a

297
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
couple on this chart uh there's

298
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
incredible business collaboration tools

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
available today where you can get into a

300
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,480
3d environment with virtual avatars of

301
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,880
your peers and others that you want to

302
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
collaborate with in a business

303
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
environment and there's dozens of these

304
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
kind of tools that are really working

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
now what about zoom like this

306
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
this is a hint of the coming virtual

307
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
environment it's a virtual interaction

308
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
now very basic still and not the

309
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
advanced sci-fi stuff that

310
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
is coming but it's a hint of a

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,680
distributed system where we can all come

312
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
together and exchange information

313
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
and a lot of folks are getting exposed

314
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
to this because of the online

315
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
environment for schools today

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
and of course the pandemic just taught

317
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
everybody about zoom another place where

318
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
we have seen hints of what is coming is

319
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
the gaming environment

320
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
roblox being one of the most famous of

321
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,480
fortnite

322
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
there are many many many others but

323
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
fortnite is so special

324
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,360
because you can create an avatar

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
and interact with others now the reason

326
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,360
why i say that is not the metaverse is

327
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
it doesn't scale you can have

328
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
20 million people watching a concert but

329
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
you can't interact with all 20 million

330
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,079
of those other people uh you are still

331
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,240
in a limited domain of who you can

332
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
interact with but still it's a hint of

333
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,399
what is coming and it's pretty exciting

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
then there's the online virtual worlds

335
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
places where you can buy land and you

336
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,560
can buy property like a decentraland is

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,480
one of the most famous and uh sandbox is

338
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,519
another

339
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
for ten thousand dollars you can buy a

340
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,600
little plot of land uh maybe it's

341
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
fifteen thousand today i need to check

342
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
there's several others like this where

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
you can buy land you don't have to buy

344
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,399
land to interact in there uh you can go

345
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
and just be a virtual avatar and you can

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
buy things if you want to or interact

347
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
with other people play games

348
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,959
it is kind of like second life

349
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,760
but

350
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
uh interoperable and distributed

351
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,839
and you can own pieces of that

352
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,800
other

353
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
indications of what the metaverse is

354
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
going to be can be seen in things like

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
pokemon go where that's a blending of

356
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,399
the physical world and the virtual world

357
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
through artificial reality

358
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
definitely there's going to be a

359
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
component of that in the metaverse

360
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
on the business side again the

361
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,519
manufacturing world and in cities

362
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,160
there's this concept of digital twins

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,800
give me a complete digital replica of a

364
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
machine or a city or a ship and i can

365
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
operate that and see if i have a better

366
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
idea for a better design or detect when

367
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
a failure is coming this is definitely

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
going to be a key uh piece of the future

369
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
metaverse now the metaverse does not

370
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,040
have to be something you enter with

371
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
goggles on you can enter the metaverse

372
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
by watching a a website or watching

373
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,760
something on your mobile device but for

374
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
the best experience people are wearing

375
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,760
uh the the devices like the oculus rift

376
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,920
of course for the gaming devices some of

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
the best are the commercial solutions

378
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
like magic leap and hololens and these

379
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,600
are giving us hints of what the coming

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
metaverse is going to be

381
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,399
as for the exchange layer of value

382
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,279
there's the web 3 revolution still very

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,880
early in

384
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
its age still a lot of issues with web 3

385
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
a lot of fraud a lot of criminal

386
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
activity but the promise is huge i'm a

387
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
huge believer in the future of web 3 and

388
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
i believe this is going to be the

389
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
interoperable store of value connecting

390
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
all of these metaverses together

391
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,760
other use cases include things like

392
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
remote medicine where through metaverse

393
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
type technologies you can get better

394
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,160
healthcare through your medical

395
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,399
professionals virtually

396
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
and participate in all sorts of kind of

397
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
um

398
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
appointments throughout with the medical

399
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
community some things you have to go in

400
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,959
for you have to get poked and prodded

401
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
you have to get blood samples drawn uh

402
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
you have to have things like that done

403
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,519
in person but a lot can just be the um

404
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,240
the interview be a remote medicine so

405
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
these are some of the things that we see

406
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,279
coming

407
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,040
today that are already here today

408
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
they're giving us hints of what's in the

409
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,839
future

410
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
now uh let's talk about the future

411
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,320
i'm really excited about this and i

412
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
really think this is going to change a

413
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
lot of how humanity works and plays

414
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
together

415
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
we will live work and play an

416
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
environment where

417
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
all of these interoperable technologies

418
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
work on top of the existing internet and

419
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,959
it gives us an ability to have

420
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,040
persistent

421
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
interactions with each other like we can

422
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
be there leave and come back and um

423
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
things

424
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
our avatar is still there continues to

425
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
live we can have a second

426
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
entity where we live

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
we can do this

428
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
with billions of other people not today

429
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
this could be decades from now but

430
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
eventually a shared persistent

431
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,120
simulation accessible by everyone at the

432
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
same time and again i do think this is

433
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
decades from now

434
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
another point

435
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
every major company is going to have a

436
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
metaverse strategy most of them are

437
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,959
forming metaverse strategies already um

438
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,959
and this includes all the big it

439
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,519
companies but soon every company will

440
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,600
have a metaverse strategy what's the

441
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,880
size of this industry um estimates vary

442
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
um i think it's a trillion dollar

443
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
industry and i think it's sooner of ice

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
later

445
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
and one of the reasons i say that is of

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
course the facebook announcement but

447
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
all the major i.t companies are

448
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,319
investing in the metaverse

449
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
and money's being made there right now

450
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
so this will be a trillion dollar

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,599
economy let me show you how one um

452
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,520
financial firm and an individual

453
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,760
matthew ball describes this

454
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,919
matthew ball has been studying the

455
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
metaverse for quite a while and he

456
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
captures the following components shown

457
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,760
on this slide

458
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
as being the places where there will be

459
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
companies

460
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
serving in this space of course

461
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
companies will build the hardware and

462
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,080
they will offer the compute services

463
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
there will be the coms fabric the

464
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
virtual platforms are built by companies

465
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
like epic or unity 3d

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
um and the many developers on top of

467
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
those the uh tools to build these

468
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,520
capabilities of are also like

469
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,640
you know epic and unity 3d payment

470
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
services will be that interoperable

471
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,200
store of value that is going to really

472
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,400
be huge

473
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
there's a lot of services around the

474
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
metaverse

475
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
already i mean for a decade there have

476
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
been people making their livings in

477
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,000
virtual environments building tools or

478
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
building clothes

479
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
and selling those in virtual

480
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,960
environments and these kind of content

481
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
services will grow so all of these are

482
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
the kind of things that matthew baldwin

483
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
are saying

484
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,919
are part of the metaverse economy and

485
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
this is what gets us to a trillion

486
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,640
dollar economy so very exciting but this

487
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
is all just background

488
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,440
it's background to get to where us we

489
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
the cyber security community

490
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,240
can start talking about the threats and

491
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
how to mitigate some of these risks

492
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
because as i mentioned

493
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
a big regret regret being part of this

494
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
wave of

495
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
the first wave of internet technologies

496
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,559
is

497
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,720
we were a little naive

498
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
some of us were

499
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
to the fact that the internet uh had so

500
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
many faults

501
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,120
we knew there were security problems and

502
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
we kept trying to address them and we're

503
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
still trying to address them

504
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
and we thought it was going to push back

505
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,280
on these dictators and bad guys and evil

506
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,559
doers and it really hasn't they have

507
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,720
pushed back themselves and used the

508
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
internet for tools of bad

509
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
so it's time for us security folks now

510
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,039
to think about this next wave the

511
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,320
metaverse

512
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
i list here what i think the big five

513
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,160
threats are

514
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
um i don't have a full solution although

515
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
after this i want to talk about a

516
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
framework that might get us towards a

517
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,400
solution but first let me review what i

518
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
think these threats are one

519
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,919
new

520
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,679
privacy threats because of the metaverse

521
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,559
think of surveillance by corporations

522
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
and by criminal groups and hostile

523
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
nations as well as just common

524
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
fraudsters

525
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,320
imagine a time when your digital life is

526
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
online

527
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
it's already online there's already more

528
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,159
of you online than it should be

529
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,280
but now

530
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
imagine even more of you is online and

531
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,000
whether you realize it or not you're

532
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
being watched and your avatar is being

533
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
watched when you're not there it's being

534
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
watched 24 7 365 to see what it will

535
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
reveal and it's being watched in a way

536
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,720
to see what your desires are

537
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,960
so you can they can better market to you

538
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,440
or better flip you or turn you

539
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
uh or better deceive you

540
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
so this is a serious serious threat with

541
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,039
the coming metaverse here's another that

542
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
now this is not simply in the domain of

543
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,799
cyber security professionals or even i.t

544
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
professionals it's something that

545
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
humanity needs to think about and that's

546
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,039
mass langer

547
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,480
this uh

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
inner new wave of the internet the

549
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
metaverse is so fun

550
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,159
i love it already imagine when it's

551
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
almost like reality um and you get these

552
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,240
super realistic simulations

553
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
imagine the effect on your dopamine and

554
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
your indoor and oxycontin imagine the

555
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
triggers and how much you're going to

556
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
love being in the metaverse uh all of us

557
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,200
so this um

558
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
is a threat that is some of us will

559
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
never want to leave and we will

560
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
reject those that try to pull us out of

561
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,440
this

562
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,360
um and so there's a worry there will

563
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
this contribute to society's mental

564
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
weakness and downfall

565
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,159
we need to think about that the next one

566
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
the uh owner afrinia

567
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
this is a well-studied state of mind

568
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,520
when people lose the ability to

569
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,720
determine what is real and what is not

570
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
and this already happens a lot to people

571
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
because of the virtual worlds that we're

572
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
in and the massive continuous

573
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
bombardment of misinformation and

574
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
disinformation the fear is that the

575
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
metaverse is going to make

576
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,559
misinformation and information even more

577
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
impactful and so we cyber security

578
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,039
professionals need to think about this

579
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,520
and how we can mitigate that threat

580
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
fraud

581
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
will be with us for as long as they're

582
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,640
human beings i'm sad to say

583
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
and the metaverse is probably going to

584
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
inject a lot of new fraud vectors

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,480
uh companies and communities need to

586
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,679
build in

587
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,480
uh trust and the bad guys want to

588
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,799
violate that trust and the more they

589
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
violate it the worse it's going to be

590
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
for communities

591
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
and we the security folks need to

592
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,600
participate in finding ways to improve

593
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,320
trust and protect the digital value of

594
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
the metaverse and keep the fraudsters

595
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,360
from stealing money from individuals and

596
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
companies and communities

597
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,679
i mentioned the last one here because

598
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,039
this is something all of us need to be

599
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
thinking about just about everybody in

600
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
humanity needs to think about this

601
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,440
the internet has in many ways uh

602
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,159
unleashed demons that should not have

603
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,240
been unleashed um

604
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
bringing like more bad people together

605
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
in ways where they can secretly conspire

606
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
to do their bad stuff

607
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
the

608
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,200
worst of it the child pornography

609
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
criminals murderers

610
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
drug runners

611
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
slave traders they all use the internet

612
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,840
terrorists use the internet

613
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,679
imagine now

614
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,120
the metaverse

615
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,760
and imagine that unleashing even more

616
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
demons and then there's the other demons

617
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,880
that we work so hard

618
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
to train people on things like

619
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
the importance of fairness

620
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
and equality

621
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,880
and justice

622
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
and the rule of law and applying to

623
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,760
everybody equally and

624
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,840
pushing back on things like misogyny

625
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,799
well we've already seen cases where

626
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,840
in 3d virtual environments

627
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
people have done bad bad things that

628
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
they never i'm sure never would have

629
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,120
done

630
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
if they knew that

631
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
they they could be

632
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,400
they were being seen

633
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,120
but they get in the metaverse and it for

634
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
something triggers on them i don't know

635
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
what it is but there have been cases of

636
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,440
horrible misogyny in interactions in the

637
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
metaverse

638
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
there's actually been a case of a

639
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
groping in the metaverse where a woman

640
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
says she was felt because of the haptic

641
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,520
device she was wearing and

642
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
of many disgusting examples of things

643
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,360
like that

644
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
we security people i think should play a

645
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
role in figuring out how to mitigate

646
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
this although we're not the only ones

647
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
everybody has to play a role in this but

648
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
we security people might be able to play

649
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
a critically important role in

650
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,679
mitigating some of that

651
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,039
these are what i think the five big

652
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,159
threats are now what's the solutions i

653
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,520
don't know

654
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
but i do know this we security people

655
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
learned a lot of lessons over the last

656
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,919
25 years and we should contribute to

657
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
finding solutions

658
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
and i think a lot of the old lessons

659
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,720
apply

660
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
but we got to find some new

661
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
solutions also

662
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,080
so my

663
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
concept and suggestion and i would love

664
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
your thoughts and feedback questions on

665
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,760
this too

666
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,159
is that we need a feedback i mean a

667
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
framework we need a framework for us to

668
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,120
be able to lay all of our thoughts out

669
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,159
and think what is the right thing to do

670
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,240
let me show you um

671
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
one idea for a framework

672
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
i believe we can establish a framework

673
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,679
for metaverse security

674
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,799
that's based on entities

675
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,679
this

676
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,080
entity-based framework for metaverse

677
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,360
security will help us ensure that the

678
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
right things are being done at the right

679
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,120
level to mitigate some of these risks

680
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,520
and here's what i mean by entities

681
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,400
i think the entities that need solutions

682
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,159
are individuals we our friends

683
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,320
everyone in all of humanity as

684
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
individuals there are things we need to

685
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:02,960
do

686
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
communities

687
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,559
i hope most of the goodness in the

688
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,799
metaverse is going to be delivered by

689
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
communities coming together well there's

690
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
things communities should do to mitigate

691
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
some of these threats

692
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
companies that makes the world go around

693
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
they deliver a lot of value

694
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,200
companies should help mitigate some of

695
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
these threats

696
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,039
governments especially

697
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,000
open governments in good countries

698
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
should help mitigate threats

699
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
uh and there's things

700
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,200
that we can spell out for them in a

701
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,679
framework and of course academia where

702
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,919
there's so much brain power and talent

703
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,480
and future focused thinking

704
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,760
there are things that they can do to

705
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,559
help

706
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,159
secure the metaverse

707
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
i have a few ideas on each of these now

708
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,039
as i go through these ideas i wanted to

709
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,320
pause and take a breath and say as you

710
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,679
have questions

711
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,640
please type them into the q and a box

712
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,000
because we'll have time at the end of

713
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
this

714
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,159
to discuss and answer these questions

715
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,640
anything that you type into this

716
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
we will get into

717
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,760
all right

718
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,480
back to the framework

719
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
individuals there's a lot that we as

720
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,200
individuals can do to

721
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,360
reduce threats to ourselves

722
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
and to others here's a few of my

723
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
recommendations

724
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
i think that we as individuals need to

725
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
learn all of us

726
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,279
about the new cryptocurrencies and how

727
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,760
cryptocurrencies can be protected and

728
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
how cryptocurrencies can be stolen and

729
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
how fraudsters try to trick you out of

730
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,919
your cryptocurrencies

731
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
we need to learn about cryptocurrency

732
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,000
wallets and the different kinds of

733
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,960
wallets

734
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
there's online wallets

735
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,360
called hot storage because they're

736
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
connected to the internet

737
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
and then there's offline storage offline

738
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
wallets called cold wallets which are

739
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
not connected to the internet extremely

740
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,720
secure

741
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,440
but both have strengths and weaknesses

742
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
also we as individuals need to keep

743
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
learning our security fundamentals uh

744
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
you need to protect your home computer

745
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,399
and your home networks because um that's

746
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,799
just fundamental if you have an

747
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,080
adversary that gets into your home

748
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,919
computer and they steal your credentials

749
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,120
and steal your logins you know it's it's

750
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
you're the weak link in the chain

751
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
we as individuals also need to

752
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
continually learn privacy best practices

753
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,799
our privacy will always be under attack

754
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,360
and there's just new methods of attack

755
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
all the time so this needs to be a

756
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,799
continuous process i think we as

757
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,799
individuals need to think through

758
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,600
pseudonymous accounts for the meters

759
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,880
we might want

760
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
multiple different personas depending on

761
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
what we're doing now this is easier said

762
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,520
than done because what we need is not

763
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,120
just personas that are pseudonymous and

764
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,679
cannot be tracked back to us

765
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
but can never be revealed in the future

766
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,240
and that is tough why

767
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
if you have a different persona for your

768
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,320
gaming personality a different persona

769
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,679
for your um news reading personality a

770
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,919
different persona for your concert going

771
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,440
personality

772
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,320
and then your a real name for your

773
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
business work and

774
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,399
community volunteer work

775
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,240
those five are all linked to the same

776
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,440
geography and you know it is knowable

777
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,399
that all five of those are the same if a

778
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,720
government really wants to dig into that

779
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,120
um it can be discovered

780
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,360
and then you know all of that work

781
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
you've done to build different

782
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,960
pseudonymous accounts is all for not

783
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
because it's all connected so we need to

784
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
think about this i'm a huge believer in

785
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,799
pseudonymity

786
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,399
but we need to understand

787
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,640
that there's risk that that can just all

788
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,159
be rolled back

789
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,240
i think we as individuals need to

790
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,279
develop our expectations

791
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,600
for the communities we work with and

792
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,200
also our expectations for companies

793
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,520
we need to be informed users of the

794
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,120
metaverse and be able to tell

795
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,679
communities and companies what we want

796
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,919
and in open societies the way it's

797
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,760
supposed to work is we are supposed to

798
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
tell the government what we want them to

799
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,159
do so we need to think about our

800
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
requirements for the metaverse and what

801
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
we want the government to do in the

802
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
metaverse we also want to tell the

803
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,919
government what we don't want them to do

804
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
in the metaverse

805
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
and so we need to think about our

806
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
requirements there and expectations

807
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
there's a lot we need to learn about the

808
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,039
metaverse before we get into it so

809
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,799
that's why i mentioned here know before

810
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,840
you go

811
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
as individuals you really need to study

812
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
up on the platform you're joining in the

813
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,240
metaverse and know about it and i talk

814
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
about these other things like mass

815
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
langer

816
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,440
i think we as individuals are the ones

817
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,960
that have to stop that for ourselves and

818
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
you do that through exercising and

819
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,000
developing self-discipline

820
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
that's that's

821
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,880
thoughts on some of the things for

822
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
individuals but now let's talk about

823
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
communities as i mentioned

824
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,720
i hope that as communities that really

825
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
develop the metaverse and bring the

826
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
metaverse to reality

827
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,159
because communities are groups of people

828
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,480
coming together to to do things that

829
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
they want to do

830
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,720
and

831
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
there's a lot communities can do to help

832
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,399
secure the metaverse

833
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,000
i think it's at the community level

834
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,559
where we need to find more ways to limit

835
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,559
misogyny and limit bullying and cut down

836
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,039
on fraud and

837
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
manipulation of people

838
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,279
i think the community level is an

839
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,440
extremely important role because

840
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,320
communities can involve users and ensure

841
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
strong feedback loops

842
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,840
when

843
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,240
users deviate from expected norms

844
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,799
including sanctions or removing from the

845
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
community and keeping a good community

846
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,000
free of the worst evils of our nature

847
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,919
at the community level

848
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
this is also a place where we can

849
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,399
develop common interoperable standards

850
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,919
especially for things like store of

851
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
value i think it's going to be something

852
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
like ethereum but whatever it is the

853
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,799
communities need to agree upon that and

854
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,240
that should be

855
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
their role i think

856
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,159
communities do a lot of design work and

857
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,159
they do that in open collaborative ways

858
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
the best of them do

859
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
and these open collaborative communities

860
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,120
that's where security should be built in

861
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
at the very beginning

862
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,000
communities also have a role in auditing

863
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,159
and testing themselves

864
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,720
and that should occur at that level

865
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
and then

866
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,279
communities also need to i hope address

867
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,440
this issue of owner

868
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
owner afrinia um easy for me to say

869
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
owner frenia

870
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
because

871
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
here it's a tough one we want

872
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,080
communities to respect privacy we really

873
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,799
do

874
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,679
but

875
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,840
it would be great if communities had a

876
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,960
way of detecting if a person

877
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,679
has

878
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
mental issues

879
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,679
and is becoming something that they

880
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,679
shouldn't be in the real world

881
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
i don't have the answer to this i'm just

882
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
saying i'm hoping communities can play a

883
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
role in

884
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,039
that let's talk a little bit about

885
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,519
high-level recommendations for companies

886
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,760
hey companies exist to deliver value and

887
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,799
i really believe that this is

888
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,080
a key component of the metaverse

889
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,320
companies should be able to make profit

890
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
and that's great as long

891
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,320
as that's not at the expense of society

892
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,720
and not at the expense of our personal

893
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
privacy and not at the expense of

894
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,200
communities that we many people will be

895
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,760
volunteering time to build

896
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,679
so a high level recommendation for

897
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,120
companies

898
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,399
understand

899
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,600
that profit is great but do not

900
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,679
do that at the expense of communities or

901
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,519
personal privacy

902
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,840
companies should also of course build

903
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,679
security and privacy protections in at

904
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,600
the beginning well we've been saying

905
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,679
things like that for decades

906
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,399
and

907
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,640
i'm always the naive and hopeful one and

908
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,399
i think oh finally they're going to

909
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,079
start doing that but really for them to

910
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,000
do that we're going to have to keep an

911
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
eye on them and keep the pressure on

912
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,639
them to do it we being individuals

913
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,520
communities and governments

914
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,359
companies have a great opportunity to

915
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,320
test their solutions through red teaming

916
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
adversarial um

917
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,879
exploitation of their systems to see how

918
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
secure they really and truly are

919
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
a company should also work with users

920
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,879
and communities to reduce risk to

921
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,079
privacy

922
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,719
and reduce the ability of criminals to

923
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,118
operate in their part of the metaverse

924
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,760
just some ideas now let's talk about

925
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,359
high level requirements and

926
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,000
recommendations for government

927
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,879
i believe that we as individuals should

928
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
encourage the government

929
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
to take these kind of steps

930
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,680
if we really want to reduce security

931
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,599
we need governments to

932
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,920
help incentivize the companies and

933
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,160
communities to build that security in

934
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,280
early

935
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
we also need governments to help find

936
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,599
ways to track and mitigate hostile

937
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,240
intelligence services in the metaverse

938
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,640
they're already there by the way

939
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
there's already indications of hostile

940
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
espionage occurring in these early

941
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,079
metaverse worlds

942
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,880
there's also indications of hostile

943
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,000
governments

944
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,640
using the metaverse already

945
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
for propaganda purposes

946
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
um and this is a threat that really in

947
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,760
our society governments should be

948
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
tracking and informing us on because

949
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,079
it's hard for individuals and companies

950
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
and communities to detect and mitigate

951
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,520
that

952
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,760
well government has a role in mitigating

953
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
the hostile intelligence services

954
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,800
there's also a role for law enforcement

955
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
but it needs to be the right role of law

956
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
enforcement you know

957
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,720
we don't want

958
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
the metaverse to become a surveillance

959
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,599
tool for the fbi for example

960
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,160
but we don't want bad guys to be able to

961
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
run through what we're doing and use it

962
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,160
for their gain either so what's the

963
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,640
right role for law enforcement

964
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,480
in fighting crime especially

965
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,680
international crime in the metaverse

966
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,079
one thing in open societies in all

967
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,599
societies we really need to push for is

968
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,400
staying on the side of human rights and

969
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
privacy when it comes to the government

970
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
because

971
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
the first thought for many might be to

972
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,440
overreact and overreach and say because

973
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,599
there's threats i will surveil

974
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,160
everything and that's not what we want

975
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
we don't want the government to become a

976
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,240
bigger threat to privacy than they

977
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,960
already are and we also want governments

978
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
everywhere to understand and respect

979
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,000
human rights because we're the humans

980
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
governments can also share threat

981
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,200
information and i think that's a key

982
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
part of their framework

983
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,160
now um academia here's one where would

984
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,000
appreciate your thoughts would love your

985
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
thoughts on this

986
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,119
what is the right role for academia in

987
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,000
reducing the threats to the metaverse

988
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,599
well one is teaching requirements

989
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,480
also teaching common language

990
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,839
to express

991
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,400
security and privacy requirements

992
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
and teaching how

993
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,960
to build with privacy and security in

994
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,680
mind uh there must be so many other

995
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,320
things for academia and would love your

996
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,640
input on this as we go forward

997
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
now that was the framework piece

998
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,240
to kind of slow down and wrap up i

999
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,599
wanted to say

1000
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,920
i think we really should start a

1001
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,839
dialogue all of us

1002
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,240
i would love it if everybody hearing

1003
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,359
this would start writing your ideas

1004
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,440
about security in the metaverse and

1005
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,720
write via any source you have access to

1006
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,040
your personal blog your personal twitter

1007
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
feed your personal linkedin

1008
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,079
facebook

1009
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,000
ask questions and state your

1010
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,079
requirements and say what you think

1011
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,760
about the coming metaverse and the need

1012
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,119
for security

1013
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,160
also

1014
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
in academia write and publish and push

1015
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,960
about requirements for the metaverse

1016
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,640
all of us as individuals should think

1017
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,040
about our requirements for the metaverse

1018
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
our requirements for what we want

1019
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,480
companies

1020
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,200
and communities and the government to be

1021
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,440
doing in the future of the metaverse

1022
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,079
and i also believe it's an extremely

1023
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,560
important point that we in the security

1024
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,760
community should teach our friends

1025
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,119
and family

1026
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,480
and co-workers and others

1027
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
in academia how to better protect their

1028
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,599
data today

1029
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,119
and of course going forward into the

1030
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,920
metaverse uh really this is something

1031
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,440
that all people ought to be thinking

1032
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,040
about how do you protect your personal

1033
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,200
information now and how do you protect

1034
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,799
it as we move into the metaverse

1035
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,920
i have a few closing thoughts i want to

1036
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,320
share with you uh just to keep the

1037
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
thoughts going

1038
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,800
uh as i do please think if you have any

1039
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,400
questions

1040
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
ask them in the q a section here

1041
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,079
we'll get to them shortly

1042
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,400
claude shannon very famous not just

1043
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,720
academic but leader

1044
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,480
of the revolution in communications

1045
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,240
brought us into the digital world i

1046
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,960
think

1047
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,760
he's said it so well when it comes to

1048
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,000
security and risk mitigation

1049
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,880
we have to assume that the enemy knows

1050
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
the system it's going to be the same

1051
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
with the metaverse we really have to

1052
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
assume

1053
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
that our adversaries the criminals the

1054
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,119
fraudsters the hostile governments are

1055
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,000
really going to know the system well

1056
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,240
we need to know the system and we

1057
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,800
security professionals need to design in

1058
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
mitigation measures

1059
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,000
that understand that the enemy knows the

1060
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
system

1061
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,000
i thought great food for thought from

1062
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
claude shannon on the metaverse

1063
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,440
john boyd you know uh spaff mentioned

1064
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
oda as the concept we named our company

1065
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,920
as an homage to this mental model the

1066
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,839
ooda loop

1067
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,720
and i always think of john boyd when i

1068
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
think of taking action

1069
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,920
and when it comes to the metaverse

1070
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,400
we should make a lot of decisions but we

1071
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,960
also need to take action and you don't

1072
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,720
just take action without thinking that's

1073
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
reckless and i think that was very well

1074
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,200
put by by boyd here i think the

1075
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,079
framework is a good strategy uh but for

1076
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,800
that i wanted to mention uh food for

1077
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
thought from winston churchill on the

1078
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
meadowverse and defending the metaverse

1079
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,040
i think it's a beautiful strategy but

1080
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,280
maybe it's not what results are we going

1081
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,040
to get with this

1082
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,359
what's the right thing if you have an

1083
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,880
approach that works now it may not work

1084
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
tomorrow and we don't even know if this

1085
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,839
is the right approach yet i really need

1086
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,839
your ideas to think through if this is

1087
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,640
the right approach

1088
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,599
and you i just like as we talk about

1089
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,280
adversaries and what they're going to be

1090
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
doing in our networks i love that

1091
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,000
science fiction so frequently expresses

1092
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,640
things about this dynamic world that are

1093
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,119
worth thinking about so i have a couple

1094
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,319
charts here on uh science fiction

1095
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,800
one from ender's game

1096
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
since when do you have to tell the enemy

1097
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,760
when he has won

1098
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
as we think about the metaverse and the

1099
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,319
role of machines in our future

1100
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,200
um

1101
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,880
you know the the whole plot of doom was

1102
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,040
set in a world

1103
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,839
where people got fed up with their

1104
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,520
machines there was no metaverse in uh

1105
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,480
dune

1106
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
because these machines

1107
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,720
were not permitted to think and i

1108
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,800
thought how awesome

1109
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,319
that was good

1110
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,160
some benefits of having adversaries um

1111
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,079
also captured from dune

1112
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
now i think this is a little too harsh i

1113
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
don't believe this is the reality but

1114
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
it's interesting to think about

1115
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,319
enemies strengthen you allies weaken no

1116
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,400
i think look allies strengthen you too

1117
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
but um it's interesting food for thought

1118
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,000
if when you are in security and you're

1119
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,520
face to face with an adversary and

1120
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,560
you're trying to push them out of your

1121
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,880
network you really should be learning

1122
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,400
you should learn as much as you can

1123
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
and you should learn how to mitigate the

1124
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
current threat you should also learn how

1125
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,079
to mitigate

1126
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,680
issues of

1127
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,200
misinformation

1128
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
and disinformation

1129
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
and i thought

1130
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,759
dune was pretty good about that too

1131
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,520
now why prepare uh there's

1132
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,720
no evidence yet that the metaverse is a

1133
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,240
threat to society well um

1134
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,560
i just wanted to share this with you

1135
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
when it comes to risk management

1136
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,520
professionals just because something

1137
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,440
hasn't happened yet

1138
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,839
doesn't mean it's not going to happen

1139
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,359
we should exercise our ability to think

1140
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,319
about future scenarios and mitigate the

1141
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,480
risk of those future scenarios

1142
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,040
this is to me something any risk

1143
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
management professional should think

1144
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,279
about

1145
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,800
you know another thing that a lot of

1146
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,160
risk management professionals should

1147
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,319
think about is wisdom from guys like

1148
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,680
staff

1149
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,240
who has been doing this for so long and

1150
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
is able to take a long view and say

1151
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
here's what's changed here's what hasn't

1152
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,560
changed through the decades

1153
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,520
another

1154
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,960
common friend

1155
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,720
said this and i

1156
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,040
just wanted to oops sorry i have to go

1157
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,480
back here

1158
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
went a little too fast

1159
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,520
said this in 1991

1160
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,480
when schwartel

1161
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,880
pointing out that

1162
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,440
government and commercial computer

1163
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,640
systems are so poorly protected today

1164
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,560
that they can essentially be considered

1165
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,040
defenseless

1166
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,720
1991 he says this

1167
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,000
and man there's been a lot of

1168
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,839
improvement over the decades there

1169
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,640
really has been uh some systems are far

1170
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,520
more secure and risk is mitigated but so

1171
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,000
many new avenues of attack have come up

1172
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
society has been threatened because of

1173
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,680
computer security issues and i just like

1174
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
mentioning this for context saying

1175
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,119
there's been a lot of warnings for a lot

1176
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
of years

1177
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
and it's time for us to really really

1178
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
work to improve protections of our

1179
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
systems

1180

1194

and with that

1197
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,440
that was great um i wanted to ask if you

1198
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,880
had had a chance

1199
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,040
to um

1200
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,240
uh

1201
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,560
listen to the talk from last week from

1202
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,920
chris stemcheck

1203
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,839
no i haven't not yet

1204
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,040
so i i think a very brief

1205
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,560
excerpt from that

1206
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,640
was the concept that

1207
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,560
we have

1208
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
major entities in this space

1209
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,839
who are building from a different set of

1210
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,160
values and goals

1211
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,359
than some of the ones you outlined

1212
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,960
and

1213
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,240
if we

1214
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,160
spend too much of our time trying to

1215
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
argue what those are

1216
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,240
the ones who are very single-mindedly

1217
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,760
building out to support their goals

1218
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,839
may become

1219
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,680
dominant and that's a danger and i i

1220
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,920
think you illustrated that as well

1221
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,000
but um

1222
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,280
for purposes of the people who are

1223
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,440
listening in this is two speakers in a

1224
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,079
row who are basically pointing that out

1225
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,119
that

1226
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,680
what we have now is not the end result

1227
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,920
we're still building towards something

1228
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,400
and if we are not careful in defining

1229
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,800
what it is we want to build we may not

1230
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,960
be overly pleased with the results of

1231
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,040
what we get

1232
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,240
uh so thank you that was great

1233
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,480
uh we have three questions in the q a so

1234
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
if you want to tackle those uh that

1235
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,079
would be great okay cool

1236
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,760
one uh kinguan yan says

1237
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,280
from reality the virtual world is

1238
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,839
growing rapidly and the impact on it is

1239
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,280
going to be wide

1240
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,560
will the progress of building the

1241
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,079
framework handle the development of the

1242
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,000
metaverse

1243
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
how can the strategy be to ensure our

1244
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,359
privacy simultaneously with the growth

1245
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,520
of technology at the same time get rid

1246
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,800
of the growing range of people who might

1247
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,920
be involved

1248
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,599
in influence in the virtual world i

1249
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,680
think that what this is getting to is

1250
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,720
how do we really articulate a strategy

1251
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,240
that's going to work

1252
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,559
in this new reality because this is

1253
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,960
gonna be tough um and just like you said

1254
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,760
spaff people are building this out um

1255
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,520
and the only way to influence this i

1256
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,000
think is if we get our ducks in a row

1257
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,319
and we start articulating what we want

1258
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,119
and what we expect and so we need to get

1259
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,520
our requirements together and articulate

1260
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,000
that say here's the world i want built

1261
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,280
um and

1262
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,839
i think we need to do that in a way that

1263
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,280
involves government

1264
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,960
but as i mentioned

1265
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,280
don't bring too much government in we

1266
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,119
don't want government surveillance of

1267
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,200
what we're doing but we want to do this

1268
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,520
in a legal framework that is smart and

1269
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,200
well thought out

1270
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,880
so i think we need to start pulling

1271
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,359
folks in like cisa

1272
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,359
jen easterly and start getting their

1273
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,559
thoughts

1274
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,000
um and

1275
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,839
maybe there's things that need to be

1276
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,720
done at the legal level

1277
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,040
but really it all starts with us as

1278
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,119
individuals getting our requirements

1279
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,160
together i think

1280
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,599
another question

1281
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
thoughts on how we impose ethics in the

1282
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,440
metaverse where the traditional minds of

1283
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,920
societies may not apply see this is

1284
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,400
another really good one because we want

1285
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,960
communities to come together from

1286
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,720
all over the world

1287
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,920
different cultures and different

1288
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,119
backgrounds and that's the way it's

1289
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,400
working today in a lot of areas

1290
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
and the ethics that one group grow up

1291
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
with is not necessarily going to be the

1292
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
ethics of another and that is even

1293
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,280
within a single region uh people have

1294
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,880
slightly different approaches and you

1295
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,680
would say different ethics and uh this

1296
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,839
is so hard and i

1297
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,240
sometimes make flippant jokes and i

1298
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,400
shouldn't i say things like uh the way

1299
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,079
to handle that is just make sure

1300
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,880
everybody follows my ethics

1301
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,200
but that's not right everybody

1302
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,440
should have their own ethical center and

1303
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,280
be able to come together in ways where

1304
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,079
we can dialogue and talk through that

1305
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,920
and i think this needs to occur at the

1306
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,520
community level

1307
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,760
where people know what community they're

1308
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,400
joining and what the code of conduct is

1309
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,880
for that community and follow that code

1310
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,680
of conduct and those ethics

1311
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,200
that's all i can say for now

1312
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,680
another thoughts on the effects of

1313
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,559
highly immersive and customized

1314
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,720
advertising

1315
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,400
which will become prevalent in the

1316
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,440
metaverse oh you're so right you know in

1317
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,079
some communities there's a fear

1318
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,160
like imagine if facebook decides that

1319
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,920
they're going to use all the data

1320
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,599
they're going to have on you to deliver

1321
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,960
ads

1322
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,480
you know they will have perhaps if

1323
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,960
you're using a headset they'll have what

1324
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,559
you're looking at

1325
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,559
and what you're interacting with in ways

1326
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,480
that are going to let them know what you

1327
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,680
desire

1328
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,720
for example if you use tick tock today

1329
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,960
they got so many great algorithms that

1330
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,520
are figuring out what you look at how

1331
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
long you look at it what you swipe to

1332
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,880
next and how long you look at that next

1333
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,000
one

1334
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,440
and what you hit the like button on but

1335
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,920
also what you're dwelling on so over

1336
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,839
just a little bit of time

1337
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,599
they're starting to figure out

1338
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,280
what your desires are and so now that

1339
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,200
they know what your desires are they can

1340
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
better market to you

1341
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,040
so imagine a metaverse that knows what

1342
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,359
your desires are and as you walk around

1343
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,680
in the metaverse your desires are being

1344
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,000
presented to you all over the place and

1345
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,680
yes i'll buy that and i'll buy that so

1346
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
it's should be highly effective

1347
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,040
advertising

1348
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,480
i the nightmare scenario for me would be

1349
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,400
if there's a world built like that that

1350
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,040
was shown in altered carbon which is a

1351
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,599
great science fiction series

1352
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,000
and in that world when you enter their

1353
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,280
version of the metaverse you just get

1354
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,280
bombarded with ads and it's really

1355
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,079
overwhelming and sickening so that's the

1356
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,000
kind of world we don't want

1357
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,079
now if we don't want that kind of world

1358
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,599
there has to be some other way that

1359
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,000
communities get enough money to support

1360
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,400
themselves or if you go the company

1361
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,000
route the companies have money to

1362
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,599
support themselves

1363
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,880
so those are just some thoughts there

1364
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,119
another question on concerns of the

1365
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,440
social mediverse

1366
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,880
uh uh

1367
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,480
concerns of the social mediverse and

1368
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,640
industrial metaverse may be very

1369
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,680
different

1370
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,680
digital twins for example and their

1371
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,400
human interfaces for example does this

1372
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,160
proliferation of cyber physical systems

1373
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
require an entirely new paradigm it

1374
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,839
definitely requires different paradigms

1375
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,520
i think maybe there's some foundational

1376
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,359
security that needs to be done on all of

1377
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,000
them but the interactions of a digital

1378
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,079
twin i think are going to be easier to

1379
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,720
restrict to you know only 12 people need

1380
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,040
access to this digital twin for a ship

1381
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,319
design

1382
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,800
or if it's a digital twin of an entire

1383
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,160
city maybe 300 people need access to

1384
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
this digital twin of the entire city and

1385
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,680
if i need other people in i'll invite

1386
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,599
them in so maybe it's easier to control

1387
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,960
that piece of the

1388
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,640
the metaverse the digital twins

1389
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,040
another question

1390
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,480
the promise of the internet the early

1391
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
days was the free exchange of thought ah

1392
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
that's so true

1393
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
today we have fear perpetuated by

1394
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
governments and corporations restricting

1395
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,160
this exchange

1396
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,760
yeah you're right

1397
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,440
uh there's fear perpetuated by

1398
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,920
governments and corporations

1399
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,200
and groups nonprofit organizations

1400
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,800
uh groups coming together and

1401
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,200
promulgating fear

1402
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,920
there's so many doing that and

1403
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,640
also groups coming together and

1404
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,559
spreading misinformation and

1405
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,559
disinformation

1406
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,359
and

1407
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,240
it's

1408
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
really the kind of threat that few of us

1409
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,920
anticipated at least to this extreme

1410
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,079
and i haven't heard the full answer yet

1411
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,880
i have seen great people studying this

1412
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,359
and fielding solutions to pieces of it

1413
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,079
but nothing that scales

1414
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,920
and i really really worry about it

1415
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,280
because one thing about humans is

1416
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,760
unfortunately it seems like we like to

1417
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,520
deceive ourselves

1418
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,800
a lot of us

1419
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,599
like

1420
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,200
to be deceived and it gives us an open

1421
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
fertile ground for misinformation and

1422
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,559
disinformation

1423
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,960
how do we mitigate this it's got to be

1424
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,920
some

1425
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,079
educational approach i think i don't

1426
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,680
know what it is but it needs to start

1427
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,480
early k-12 education on critical

1428
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,000
thinking

1429
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,400
not every school is the same as the same

1430
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,599
curriculum

1431
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,319
many high schools today do teach some

1432
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,160
pieces of critical thinking but it's

1433
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,000
kind of an oh by the way maybe that

1434
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,520
should be the center of the whole

1435
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
educational experience

1436
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,440
is how to think about analytical

1437
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,800
methodologies

1438
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,040
and how to think about your own human

1439
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,599
biases and all the wonderful research

1440
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,720
that's been done on that and um how to

1441
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,760
spot

1442
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,160
misinformation and disinformation

1443
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,880
maybe that should be the centerpiece of

1444
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,040
all k-12 education

1445
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,000
and then a little bit of math and

1446
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,520
science on the side

1447
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,640
uh just a thought

1448
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,480
well i would uh

1449
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,640
i would react to that bob myself by

1450
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,240
saying that

1451
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,240
in my experience and i think if you

1452
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,760
reflect on this

1453
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,280
um

1454
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,319
lots of organizations and individuals

1455
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,000
don't want to promote critical thinking

1456
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,079
and don't want to promote controls

1457
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,680
because it would get in the way of them

1458
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,839
putting out their possibly false

1459
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:52,960
messages

1460
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,920
yeah

1461
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,880
uh

1462
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,680
and

1463
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,440
and you know we we've seen that a lot

1464
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,359
recently whether it's in

1465
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,760
politics whether it's on views about

1466
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,319
what's happening with ukraine uh views

1467
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,440
on

1468
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,119
vaccines

1469
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,319
we have

1470
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,640
a number of different viewpoints and the

1471
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,240
people who are holding out with ones

1472
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,680
that may be

1473
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,839
contrary to the public good

1474
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,559
don't want their speech restricted

1475
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,680
yeah

1476
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,760
you know i think you're so right and way

1477
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,559
before the age of the internet um we can

1478
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,839
go back and see the ads for cigarettes

1479
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,079
where uh nine out of ten doctors prefer

1480
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,119
camels

1481
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,200
and smoking is good for you and it's

1482
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,559
good for the lungs

1483
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,480
and it's just that was believed and it

1484
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,200
was pushed by the advertisers even when

1485
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,799
evidence was coming out that it was

1486
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,440
cancerous they continued to push that

1487
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,280
and that's just one example the next

1488
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
really really big one in the time scale

1489
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,240
was the sugar industry when i was

1490
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,079
growing up and maybe this excuse why i

1491
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,480
can't keep the weight off it was sugar

1492
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,880
is just calories like any other calories

1493
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,280
there's no problem have as much sugar as

1494
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,960
you want as long as you're counting

1495
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,359
calories a calorie's a calorie

1496
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,559
um and that was all a bunch of bs sugar

1497
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,799
is like poison and

1498
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,200
it's just one after the advertisers are

1499
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,640
bad of course the polarized politics we

1500
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,960
can't get away from uh but there's an

1501
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,000
example i think where um a large number

1502
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,079
of people would not want

1503
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,760
a lot of critical thinking taught and

1504
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,440
you're right i think in fact some people

1505
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,119
would push back and say if we propose

1506
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,720
critical thinking as the core of

1507
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,200
education everywhere uh oh there's

1508
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,799
government mind control they're trying

1509
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,079
to control us all yep yeah i just uh

1510
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,559
so i hope this isn't a gloomy thought

1511
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,839
but i i wish we had more critical

1512
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
thinking i i i well as an educator i

1513
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:46,720
agree

1514
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,599
i i think we we have some some issues

1515
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,400
there

1516
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,599
and

1517
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,000
uh we actually are seeing a backlash now

1518
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
in a number of states where legislation

1519
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,240
is being introduced that prevents

1520
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,640
teaching anything that might

1521
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,520
upset students parents

1522
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,280
uh in any way

1523
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,520
so whatever their preconceived notions

1524
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,480
are

1525
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,160
whether it's backed by history or

1526
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,400
scientific fact they don't want to talk

1527
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,599
hopefully that's just temporary

1528
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,760
but

1529
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,440
it goes to a lot of what you're talking

1530
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,319
about

1531
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,920
as to

1532
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,680
being able to move forward we need an

1533
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,640
educated uh workforce we need an

1534
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,880
educated populist who can actually think

1535
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,040
through some of these issues rather than

1536
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,240
being told what's right and wrong

1537
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,359
and uh

1538
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,880
we're not at a point in our history

1539
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,359
right now where that's necessarily the

1540
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,599
uh

1541
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,240
the universal uh certainly

1542
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,078
and maybe not even the popular view

1543
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,559
and i say i i hesitate to say that

1544
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,799
because it sounds gloomy but

1545
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:55,680
um

1546
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,559
you know as a his as a

1547
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,079
somebody who's looked at history i won't

1548
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,000
call you a historian but

1549
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,319
um we do have cycles

1550
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,680
of what

1551
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,359
people are willing to accept and uh what

1552
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,760
people are going to demand to be able to

1553
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,319
deal with challenges

1554
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,119
right

1555
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,040
so you've got an audience here and

1556
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,960
possibly others who will listen to this

1557
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,160
who i think

1558
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,880
should take this to heart that to think

1559
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,160
through there aren't simple answers

1560
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,680
but we have to learn how to think

1561
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,440
carefully about them

1562
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,480
