1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
and so we'll get started um this is the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,160
first presentation of the semester and

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,520
of the year

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,200
and i am absolutely delighted to welcome

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
our speaker uh melissa dark

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
melissa was one of the

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,480
um

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,760
early

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
members of the the staff and then

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,880
faculty

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,080
of sirius in our early days here at

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,119
purdue

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
she served as assistant director there

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
for a number of years

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,840
and helped run a number of programs

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
she helped get the infosec

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
interdisciplinary degree started here at

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,520
purdue and for a number of years she was

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
the wc furnace professor uh in the

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
computer network information technology

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,920
and what is now the polytechnic while

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
also serving there as assistant and then

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,760
as associate dean

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
um in recent years she's been running a

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
non-profit and there's some information

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
about that not only in her bio but in

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
the presentation she's going to give us

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,559
uh

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
she's had an incredible impact on cyber

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,960
security education not only at purdue

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
but nationally and perhaps even

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
internationally

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
uh and without further introduction let

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
me introduce our star for the day

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,840
uh dr melissa dark

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
melissa

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,840
thank you staff

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,640
um this is in a lot of ways it is like a

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,000
homecoming

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
um

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,079
so

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,360
when

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
a staff reached out and

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,759
asked if i would like to talk i said yes

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
of course i think i was supposed to do

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
this maybe last november

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
um and i lost my dad so i rescheduled

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,640
here to 2022.

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,600
i did start at sirius in 2000.

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
and when i started at sirius in the year

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
2000

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,240
um purdue was one of only seven

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,799
universities in the united states

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
recognized for its information security

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
program

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
and now i think we use the term cyber

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
security but at that point in time we

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
really use the term

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,879
information security

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,160
um

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,720
so much has changed in in just 22 years

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
so purdue still in in my heart and mind

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
is one of the flagship schools for

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,840
educating students and producing quality

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
research in cyber security but today we

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,959
sit at about 350

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,959
institutions of higher education

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
universities colleges and community

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,879
colleges

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
that offer cyber security degrees to

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
students

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
and so

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
much of this work

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,879
over the last 22 years 25 years has been

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
to try to build a workforce

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
and i wanted to talk a little bit about

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
the next generation cybersecurity

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
workforce i wanted to talk about

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
progress and i want to also talk a

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
little bit about challenges

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,840
so i've been in this space now

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
for

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
almost 22 years

84
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
when spaff first hired me he hired

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
another woman

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,799
and he said melissa what i'd like you to

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,000
work on

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,200
is education initiatives for everything

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
18 years and older

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
so they will have already graduated from

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
high school

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
any education initiative

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
to do cyber security education for

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
somebody who is over the age of 18

95
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
is fair game

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,439
and he hired another woman who was going

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,400
to work on k-12 and did work on k-12

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
um

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
so as the talk i think unfolds um you'll

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
see that i have now migrated to the the

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
k-12 space

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
um so i'm going to talk a little bit

103
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
about what i think the workforce

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
challenge is how i think about the call

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
to action

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,520
um to meet this workforce challenge

107
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
i'm going to talk about work to date and

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
because we only have a little bit of

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,759
time i'm going to talk about my current

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
work to date

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
um

112
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
and then where i see some of it going in

113
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
the future

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
and then open it up for some questions

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,479
and

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,759
really

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
my hope is that

118
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,800
some of you who are listening today

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
will get excited about what i'm talking

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,400
about and look to get involved

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
so

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
cyber security um

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
i think there are two ways that i'd like

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,360
to characterize the workforce challenge

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,039
this is the first way

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
cyber security involves

127
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,240
lots of things hardware software

128
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
networks

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
data people and the integration of all

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
of this

131
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,479
into

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
our daily and and

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,479
physical and social worlds

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
um

135
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,280
cyber security

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
matters to a lot of different

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,320
stakeholders it matters to society it

138
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
matters to corporations it matters to

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
agencies

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,759
state agencies local agencies

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
federal agencies it matters to the

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
national infrastructure it matters to

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,759
individuals

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,560
and

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
cyber security matters because

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
all of these things society corporations

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
individuals infrastructures are

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
increasingly reliant

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
and you all know this because you care

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
about cyber security

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
um

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
but when you think about

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
these top two bullets cyber security

154
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
involves hardware software networks data

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
people and the integration of that cyber

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
security matters to society corporations

157
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
agencies

158
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,479
infrastructure individuals

159
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
it makes talking about motivating and

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
educating people in cyber security it

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
makes it a

162
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,039
big

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
hairy problem

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
um

165
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
everyone is a lot of people to educate

166
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,960
who needs to be educated what do they

167
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,440
need to be educated on to what extent to

168
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
what degree how much of this is about

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,919
cyber safety for every single person

170
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,359
just like we do you know

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,759
every single person is expected to wear

172
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,199
a seat belt

173
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,639
and to drive defensively

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
and then what pieces of knowledge in the

175
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,520
cyber security domain

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
are

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,800
go beyond that cyber safety for every

178
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
person

179
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
and help us think about how do we

180
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
educate people who are going to build

181
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,599
secure systems

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,840
do they need to know different things

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
than people who are not going to build

184
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,639
them but are just going to operate them

185
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
um do the people who are going to

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
operate

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
secure systems need to know different

188
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,840
things from people who are

189
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,039
protecting existing infrastructure

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
technology changes all the time how do

191
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,199
you keep people

192
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,840
continually up to date

193
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
um

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
so when you think about you start to

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
peel back the onion

196
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
well what do we mean about

197
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
educating people about cyber security

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
there are a lot of other questions that

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
need to be answered

200
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,919
and so we're always trying to think

201
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
about these questions and how to answer

202
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,960
these questions um

203
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
and how the questions are changing

204
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,880
in in the face of

205
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
a pretty

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
significant workforce shortage

207
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
right so

208
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
i have a number here that says roughly

209
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,040
520 000 unfilled jobs today i'm sure

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
many of you have seen similar numbers

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
they might

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
go a little bit lower might go a little

213
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,399
bit higher

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
it depends on what information source

215
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
you're using this came from using

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,519
cyberseek

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
and the bureau of labor statistics

218
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
projects a 31

219
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
job growth

220
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,850
in cyber security

221
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,360
[Music]

222
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,519
so that means that we could potentially

223
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
be at a you know

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
upwards of 681 000 unfilled jobs by by

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,640
2029

226
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,839
current college production if you take

227
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
those

228
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
350

229
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
community colleges colleges and

230
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,000
universities producing people at the

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
associate

232
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
baccalaureate

233
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
master's

234
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
ph.d level

235
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,839
um

236
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,640
it probably is around 23 000 24 000

237
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
per year

238
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,719
um so obviously

239
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,640
supply

240
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
is not coming close to meeting what we

241
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
have in terms of workforce demand

242
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
and this is just looking at it from the

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,240
sheer numbers it doesn't break it down

244
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
and say well how many people do we need

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,440
in

246
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,240
systems ark architecture how many people

247
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
do we need in r d so that we can

248
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
build

249
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
more secure systems how many people do

250
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
we need in governance and administration

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
and

252
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
leadership and policy

253
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
how many people would we need in

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
analytics how many people would we need

255
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,680
in forensics

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,399
um

257
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,279
so

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
working in this space

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
for 22 years now

260
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
three years ago

261
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
i came to a point in my career where i

262
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
thought i don't know if this is where i

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,360
could have the biggest impact

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
i had been able to work with staff and

265
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
to work with joel in

266
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,079
sirius to

267
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,399
help grow those

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,360
seven

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
universities that had cae designation

270
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
we mentored other schools we had faculty

271
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
development programs we brought in

272
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,360
faculty from other universities trained

273
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
these faculty

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
so that they could go back to their home

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
institutions

276
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
and start growing cybersecurity courses

277
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
that then would grow into cybersecurity

278
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
minors that then would grow into

279
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
cybersecurity majors

280
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
and today spaff and i could pull out the

281
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,000
list of these schools and and we could

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
name names and say well we helped get

283
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
that school started down the path to

284
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,279
having a cyber security major

285
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,240
and so we were really proud of that work

286
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,760
um but when you look at these shortfalls

287
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
it's clear that something else has to

288
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,160
happen

289
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
in order to change the landscape and in

290
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
order to try to

291
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
provide the kind of cyber security

292
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
workforce that we need in the united

293
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
states

294
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
and so

295
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
while i was hired initially to work on

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
projects in cyber security education

297
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,200
that were for anybody 18 and over and

298
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
my colleague judy was hired to work on

299
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,079
k-12

300
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
about five years ago six years ago

301
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
i got asked to join two projects that

302
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
were high school projects while i was

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
still at purdue

304
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
and when i got asked to join those

305
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
projects

306
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
i felt that spaff's vision back in 2000

307
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
when he hired me and judy

308
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
and spaff's vision to hire judy to do

309
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,720
something in the k-12 space

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,120
i felt that the time was finally right

311
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,000
that we were ready to start working

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
in k-12 education

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,200
in in cyber security

314
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,680
and so one of those projects

315
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,399
was a national science foundation grant

316
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
funded by the college

317
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
funded by the national science

318
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,600
foundation to integrate more cyber

319
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,399
security into the college board class

320
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,240
advanced placement computer science

321
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,240
principles

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
the second project that i was asked to

323
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
join five six years ago

324
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,839
was gen cyber which is a series of

325
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,519
summer camps

326
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,279
for either students or teachers funded

327
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,760
by the national security agency and the

328
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,959
national science foundation

329
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
so i started working on on those two

330
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
projects

331
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
and at the time that i said yes to both

332
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,240
of those projects

333
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
in my mind what i was doing was taking a

334
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
field trip into k-12 cyber security

335
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
education

336
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,880
um but my field trip ended up

337
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
being a fork in the road

338
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,199
and so i did retire from purdue three

339
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
years ago

340
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
and i as bef mentioned in the

341
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,199
introduction i work full time in

342
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
k-12 mostly

343
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
high school

344
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,399
cyber security education

345
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
so i want to talk now about

346
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
if that's the challenge

347
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
you know trying to understand what we

348
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
need in cyber security education both

349
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
the numbers

350
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,360
as well as where do we need those people

351
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
um

352
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
and trying to understand

353
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
if you have limited resources limited

354
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
time limited money to affect

355
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,440
significant change

356
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,199
where can you affect significant change

357
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,040
and i already told you i decided it

358
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,519
would be in the k-12 space and right now

359
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
in the high school space

360
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
so if we look just at that space

361
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,680
i think of the call to action

362
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,880
in one of three ways using one of three

363
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
metaphors

364
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,839
i first of all think of the call to

365
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
action as building

366
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,959
pipelines

367
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,480
um so attracting and retaining students

368
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
and pipelines are usually

369
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
thought of you know if this is what you

370
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
need

371
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
on the tail end coming out of

372
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,240
college and we'll just say

373
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
this is the number of students we need

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
coming out of a bachelor's degree

375
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,199
you know

376
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
backing up if that's what you need

377
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,399
coming out of a bachelor's degree

378
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,000
how big does this

379
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
need to be coming out of high school

380
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,279
assuming that you're not going to

381
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
get all the students who take cyber

382
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
security in high school

383
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,399
going into cyber security in college if

384
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
this is what you need in high school

385
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
then backing up how big does the funnel

386
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
need to be and what do you need to be

387
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,720
doing in middle school

388
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
to move some students forward from

389
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
middle school to high school cyber

390
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
security education and then backing up

391
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,880
what do you need

392
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,600
as early as elementary school

393
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
assuming that

394
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
you're always going to have

395
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,120
some some leakage

396
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
so sometimes i think about cyber

397
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
security education and the challenge

398
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,000
using this metaphor

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
and the work i'm doing using this

400
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,079
metaphor

401
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
sometimes i think about the the

402
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
challenge not using a pipelines metaphor

403
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,079
which is usually applied to

404
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,039
institutions

405
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
um but i think about it using a pathways

406
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
metaphor

407
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
and the pathways metaphor

408
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
really comes at the problem less from an

409
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
institutional lens and more from an

410
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,600
individual lens

411
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
how do you develop routes that are

412
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
learner

413
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
friendly

414
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
um

415
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
and and learner

416
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,760
facilitating

417
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
to help them

418
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,720
build their knowledge progressively

419
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,600
right

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
and so

421
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
how do you think about this challenge

422
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
and what you do

423
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
with out of school time activities and

424
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
how does somebody learn something in an

425
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
out of school time activity like a gen

426
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
cyber camp

427
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
and then if they learn it in a gen cyber

428
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
camp

429
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
how could they build on that

430
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,559
once they go back to their high school

431
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,480
if their first exposure to cyber

432
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
security education is in their high

433
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
school

434
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
how might they then seek out an out of

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
school time activity how do those

436
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
things

437
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,440
work together to feed them into college

438
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
how do we analyze how these things are

439
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
working together and how many people

440
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
were getting to go to college

441
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
is it responsive to

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,799
community priorities from there how do

443
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,840
these paths lead to the workforce or

444
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
lead to graduate school

445
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,760
people

446
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
people

447
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
pick careers

448
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
having an accumulation

449
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
of learning experiences

450
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,080
um

451
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
and and how do we understand how those

452
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
learning experiences might be or might

453
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,799
not be contributing to the the workforce

454
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,280
the size and the nature of the workforce

455
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
that we're trying to build

456
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
um so that's kind of that lens

457
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,640
um

458
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
and then the third lens that i i like to

459
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
use in thinking about my work is

460
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,160
ecosystems

461
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
so

462
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,200
no two places are the same

463
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,520
um

464
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
when i was at purdue spaf and i

465
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,559
um but one of the sfs grants the

466
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,440
scholarship for service grants and i

467
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
would go

468
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
to sfs

469
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,000
meetings and i would talk to people from

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
other universities that had sfs grants

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,679
and

472
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,559
students were coming to purdue

473
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,840
and purdue was a certain ecosystem to

474
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,480
learn about cyber security but to also

475
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,640
launch students into their career in

476
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
cyber security and it was a very

477
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,159
different ecosystem because indiana is

478
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,400
not a large in defense

479
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
ecosystem

480
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
it's a manufacturing and an agriculture

481
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,559
ecosystem

482
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,320
and

483
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,480
that was very different than maybe

484
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,760
sitting next to you know carnegie mellon

485
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,559
that's in pittsburgh or

486
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,280
um george washington university that's

487
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
in washington dc or the university of

488
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
maryland that's right there

489
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
you know in in the

490
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
nsa and intelligence community

491
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,919
and so

492
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
i like to also think about how

493
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
when and where and why cyber security

494
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
should develop in a particular

495
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
ecosystem

496
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
to help that ecosystem do what it needs

497
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,880
to do

498
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,000
but at the same time to help it serve

499
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
its

500
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
its participants its residents its

501
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,280
habitants

502
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
who may or may not stay in that

503
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,520
particular ecosystem

504
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,840
um

505
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
so i try to think really carefully using

506
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
all of these metaphors when when i think

507
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,200
about

508
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,840
what could we do

509
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
now in cyber security education and what

510
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
should we do now in cyber security

511
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,240
education

512
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,919
because things that you can do are not

513
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,600
necessarily things that you should do

514
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,039
and things that you should do aren't

515
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,200
necessarily things that you can do

516
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,600
so i'm going to transition now and talk

517
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
a little bit about about my particular

518
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
work

519
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,679
um and and this is really work that has

520
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
been underway

521
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,440
since i retired from purdue in in 2019

522
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
um

523
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
in

524
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,600
late 2017

525
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
a set of guidelines was issued by a

526
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,120
joint task force from the association

527
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,039
for computing machinery and ieee

528
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
and it was a set of guidelines on what

529
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
should be in

530
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,080
an undergraduate cyber security degree

531
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,559
and those guidelines are now being used

532
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
by abet which is the accreditation board

533
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
of engineering and technology

534
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
to accredit

535
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,960
undergraduate cybersecurity

536
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
degrees across the united states

537
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,440
and that was really significant to me

538
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
because once we had those guidelines

539
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,559
i felt that we could start to express

540
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,080
down to the high school level

541
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
what from those guidelines would be

542
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
considered introductory knowledge that

543
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,159
you might see

544
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,120
in a cyber security 101 course at the

545
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
college level

546
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,440
or could even potentially see in a high

547
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
school cyber security course

548
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
and the first time i was asked that

549
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
question

550
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
from a high school teacher what should i

551
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,360
teach in my

552
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
high school class what does purdue

553
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,200
university

554
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
want me to teach in high school cyber

555
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
security

556
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,559
so that students would be prepared to

557
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,720
come to purdue the first time i was

558
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
asked that question was in

559
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
2015

560
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
and i thought it was a common sense and

561
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
a good question

562
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
because we know that in a lot of other

563
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
fields we know what is in

564
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
math 151 at purdue university which is a

565
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,639
calculus class

566
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
and we know what is in

567
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
calculus

568
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,279
advanced placement calculus

569
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,880
a and b at the high school level

570
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
we know what is in

571
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,799
an intro to biology an intro to

572
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,080
chemistry and intro to physics

573
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
and what can be in an advanced placement

574
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,960
high school class in biology chemistry

575
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,600
and physics

576
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,120
um

577
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,240
so

578
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,960
using that i thought now that we have

579
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,679
these csec guidelines to credit higher

580
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,480
ed

581
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
i'm going to try to build a set of

582
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
guidelines

583
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,360
that high schools across the country

584
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,960
can use to develop cyber security

585
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,520
courses in their high school

586
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,000
deliver those courses

587
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
and

588
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
then try to work towards building dual

589
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
and concurrent and placement credit

590
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,240
pathways

591
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,480
so where we are with this work right now

592
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,279
it the work is published it got

593
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,559
published

594
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,720
two years ago

595
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,679
you can go to the

596
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,520
teachcyber.org website and you can find

597
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
the curriculum guidelines there you can

598
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,440
also go to the national cryptologic

599
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
foundation

600
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,080
um

601
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
they were our partners and sponsors

602
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,399
in in doing this work

603
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,279
um the guidelines themselves are based

604
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
on eight big ideas that we think are

605
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,520
important to cyber security i can

606
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
quickly

607
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
list those eight big ideas the

608
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
they're not necessarily in order of

609
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
importance

610
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,600
so they are ethics establishing trust

611
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
data security

612
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,320
networks of security

613
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
system security

614
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,600
adversarial thinking risk and

615
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,399
implications

616
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,279
so each one of those big ideas

617
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
in the body of knowledge of what is

618
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
meant by them is expressed in these

619
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,840
guidelines

620
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
so today

621
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,799
january 12 2022

622
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,559
there are about 600 registrants from all

623
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,480
50 states

624
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,200
who use these guidelines

625
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
those registrants in some cases in many

626
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,360
cases are high school teachers or

627
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
state departments of education

628
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
some of them are higher ed we have a few

629
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,158
industry and government users as well

630
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
i'm happy to say that there are also

631
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
several curriculum development efforts

632
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,840
that have used the guidelines to

633
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,480
actually develop teaching materials so

634
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,520
when i think about curriculum guidelines

635
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,240
i think that they are an expression of

636
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
what to teach

637
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
but when i think about curriculum

638
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
materials i think that it is giving high

639
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,080
school teachers the resources

640
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,639
to actually do that so it's how to teach

641
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,000
cyber security

642
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
so the curriculum development efforts

643
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
that are underway include

644
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,880
a project that i helped found called

645
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
teach cyber

646
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
there's a consortium out of the

647
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,880
university of alabama that includes

648
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
about

649
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
six colleges universities that are

650
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
developing

651
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,840
an online curriculum for rural and

652
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
homeschooled students based on the

653
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,159
guidelines

654
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,399
the army

655
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:02,960
jrotc

656
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
is now developing a high school

657
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,520
curriculum to be rolled out at jrotc

658
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
schools based on the curriculum

659
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,679
guidelines

660
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,080
there's some other local efforts we know

661
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
of some teachers in colorado

662
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
there's a really cool effort

663
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,159
by the deaf and hard of hearing schools

664
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,320
across the united states they've

665
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,600
developed

666
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,159
an online or a one-year course for deaf

667
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
and hard of hearing students at the high

668
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,840
school level based on the guidelines

669
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,559
and just yesterday i got contacted by

670
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,360
some

671
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
colleagues at the university of texas

672
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,480
austin

673
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
looking to develop

674
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
a curriculum based on the guidelines

675
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
um

676
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,640
this work the the next step i think for

677
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
the guidelines themselves

678
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,600
is

679
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
i hope to work with the acm

680
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,840
um to

681
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,480
revisit the guidelines and to make the

682
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
guidelines an official

683
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,840
publication of acm

684
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
that expresses what should be in a cyber

685
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,080
one class

686
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
in the united states regardless of

687
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
whether that class is taught at the

688
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,159
college level or at the high school

689
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,480
level

690
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
so the second thing that i've been

691
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,279
working really hard on

692
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,200
is to give high school teachers

693
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
courseware

694
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
and so we built a modular

695
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,440
course it's a year-long

696
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,080
course but teachers can take bits and

697
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
pieces of it they can

698
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
eliminate some of it and turn it into a

699
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
semester course they can eliminate more

700
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,120
of it and turn it into a nine week

701
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,760
course we have other teachers who just

702
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,399
take bits and pieces and make it into a

703
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
two week or a three week unit on cyber

704
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,080
security

705
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,600
the teach cyber courseware is available

706
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,679
at no cost to teachers

707
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,279
we've been lucky so far knock on wood

708
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,840
to get grant funding to make it

709
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
available as a creative commons

710
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
work to teachers across the united

711
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,559
states

712
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,039
we have about

713
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,720
1025 it might be

714
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,520
26 or 27 it seems like we get a new

715
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
teacher

716
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
at least every other day

717
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
from 48 states who are using our

718
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
courseware

719
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
we currently hear things like

720
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,080
boy your material is very current it's

721
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,200
very relevant it's very engaging we love

722
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
the amount of active learning we love

723
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,159
the hands-on that you have

724
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,720
we partner with the us cyber range which

725
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,279
is a safe sandbox environment

726
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,919
so that students can get actual

727
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,360
hands-on experience doing cyber security

728
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,640
teachers say we like that it's sequenced

729
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,600
but it's highly adaptable

730
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,440
and we also frequently hear it's pretty

731
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
easy for them to integrate that into

732
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,199
their learning management system

733
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,360
so i'm gonna go forward a slide

734
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,039
but before i do

735
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
what to teach

736
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
how to teach it

737
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
an assessment is the third

738
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,960
critical piece of the triangle

739
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,279
so how do you know that they know it

740
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,200
and so that's what i wanted to talk

741
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
about next which is a project that just

742
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,240
recently got funded by the national

743
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,360
science foundation to develop assessment

744
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,120
resources for cyber security

745
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,240
so we launched this project july the 1st

746
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,200
we have four

747
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,559
things that we're trying to

748
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,679
enable if it makes sense

749
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
over the next

750
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,000
10 years

751
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,039
um the first which is really the focus

752
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
of this grant is to develop

753
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,159
embedded classroom assessment resources

754
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,320
so the arc project

755
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
is developing assessment based on the

756
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,679
high school cyber security curriculum

757
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
guidelines

758
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,880
it will give teachers

759
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,120
assessment items and a bank of

760
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,960
assessment items that they can use

761
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,039
whether they're teaching the whole

762
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,480
year-long course or a semester long or a

763
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
nine-week or just

764
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,120
a two-week unit

765
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,360
um

766
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
this could i think over the

767
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,960
course of this three-year project i

768
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
think there's the potential that it

769
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,840
could

770
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,600
start to grow into the possibility of a

771
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,639
placement test

772
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,679
just as we have

773
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,279
ap

774
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,559
calculus a and ap calculus b and ap

775
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,200
chemistry and ap physics

776
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,399
um

777
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,279
maybe someday we could have an

778
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,039
ap computer

779
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,760
or cyber security

780
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,159
test that would give students college

781
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,399
credit for a course that they took at

782
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,279
the high school level

783
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,799
educational research in any field relies

784
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,960
on valid reliable robust assessment so

785
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,039
the arc project i think could be useful

786
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,240
in educational research

787
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,519
and then finally the way that we usually

788
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
credential teachers to teach something

789
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,520
at the

790
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,000
k-12 level

791
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,040
is through both a degree and a praxis

792
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
test

793
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,839
and so there's the potential

794
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,000
let's not think in the next three years

795
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
or five years or seven years

796
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,520
but as as cyber security scales up

797
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,918
in high schools

798
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,599
maybe we'll reach in 10 or 15 years a

799
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,760
point where we we could have a need for

800
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,720
a praxis test

801
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,719
i also tend to work in other areas to

802
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,599
try to build awareness and interest in

803
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,079
cyber security it's a really young field

804
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,879
in the k-12 space

805
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,560
i'm currently partnering with the

806
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
department of energy to

807
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,839
create a high school competition called

808
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,119
cyber force guardians

809
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,200
we're actively trying to work on

810
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
creating club kits some schools need to

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,560
get started teaching cyber security with

812
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,960
an after school club

813
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,920
so we're trying to enable that

814
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
um have a lot of conversation

815
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
about how to extend the high school

816
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
cyber security curriculum guidelines

817
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,119
down to the middle school back to that

818
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,960
idea of building the pipeline

819
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,200
so i'm actively working there

820
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
the last thing i wanted to talk about

821
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
with regard to work today is another

822
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,680
recently funded project funded by the

823
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
national site

824
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
national security agency

825
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
um and it is the national cyber security

826
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,000
teaching academy

827
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,359
so

828
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,079
the nonprofit that i i founded dark

829
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
enterprises is partnering with the

830
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,119
university of arkansas little rock the

831
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,079
university of louisville and depaul

832
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,000
university

833
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
to offer a 12 credit hour graduate

834
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,560
certificate to teachers

835
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,240
will be a teacher credential

836
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
these would be in-service teachers so

837
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,720
they would already be out in in the

838
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,280
school's teaching not getting their

839
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,320
bachelor's degree

840
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,480
and

841
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
we think it's the first of its kind in

842
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,680
the united states

843
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,720
and so

844
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,040
starting this summer summer of 2022

845
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,720
we will have 90 teachers

846
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
high school teachers from across the

847
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
united states

848
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,119
um

849
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,680
earning this graduate certificate

850
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
with a scholarship

851
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
as a function of the support from the

852
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,000
national security

853
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,560
agency um so i'm i'm really proud of

854
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
this work

855
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,800
but um

856
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,400
why why i think more help is needed is

857
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,440
on this slide right here

858
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,400
um

859
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,079
the challenge is a big one

860
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
if we in fact need and and we could

861
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,400
argue about whether it's 520 000 people

862
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,599
or it's going to be 689 000 or maybe

863
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,800
it's only 300 000. maybe it's only 200

864
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,160
000.

865
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,599
um

866
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,160
if it's only 200 000 and we're currently

867
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
producing about 23 000 from college it

868
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
still is a pretty significant shortage

869
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,359
you know so

870
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,240
i think the work is important work

871
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,200
but it's hard work

872
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,160
and it's hard work for a variety of

873
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
reasons

874
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,640
education is a state right in the united

875
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,760
states

876
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,200
it's not federal it's not easy

877
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,480
to put your finger or to put your

878
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
time and energy one place to try to

879
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,320
affect

880
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,119
policy change

881
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,079
it's

882
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,240
50 places

883
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,599
and then you work with states who say

884
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,800
look we're a local control state

885
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
so when you talk to a state that says

886
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,640
we're a local control state they're

887
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
telling you we really don't even have

888
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
very many state mandates

889
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,119
you know and so if you're talking to a

890
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,040
local control state and you're working

891
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,640
in a state that has 96 counties

892
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,119
there's 96 belly buttons that you have

893
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,599
to push

894
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
so it's it's hard

895
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
um

896
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,880
i think if we if we could do more

897
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
collaborative

898
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,760
work and i think that includes more

899
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
meaningful work with industry

900
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
um

901
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
maybe we could move the needle a little

902
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,839
a little faster because

903
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,000
we would have a common message to k12

904
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,640
even if we have a common message to k12

905
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,880
the curriculum is crowded

906
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
k-12 education largely has a lot of

907
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,839
mouths to feed

908
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,960
and not nearly enough resources to do

909
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,800
that

910
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,480
um

911
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,640
i've not been a part of trying to

912
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,839
integrate computer science into k-12

913
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,839
that's not been my

914
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
my life's work

915
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,760
but i know a lot of people who have done

916
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,800
it

917
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,320
and i've seen it as it has happened

918
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,079
they've been at this 20-plus years

919
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,359
and today

920
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,359
2022 computer science is in 51 of the

921
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,280
high schools in the united states but

922
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,480
it's not a part of the core curriculum

923
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,280
so

924
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,520
51 of the high school students in the

925
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
united states are not taking computer

926
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,720
science

927
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
so if you look at how hard and they've

928
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,319
accomplished so much to get to this

929
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,440
point

930
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,800
but they've worked really really hard

931
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,359
um i think we need

932
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,520
to start getting organized

933
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,480
and ready to work that hard and i think

934
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,200
in the process of doing so we need to to

935
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
make

936
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,560
those people who have pioneered high

937
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,880
school computer science possible we need

938
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,800
to make them our allies and work with

939
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,599
them

940
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,960
um cyber security is still pretty new

941
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,440
the body of knowledge is not completely

942
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
settled um

943
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,920
getting it a little more settled

944
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,839
i mean i i've been trying to help settle

945
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,800
it i've been trying to help define it

946
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,560
um

947
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,119
but getting it further defined and

948
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,480
accepted is is still some hard work that

949
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,200
needs to be done and needs more

950
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,839
hands and

951
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,880
influencers interested in working on it

952
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
um

953
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,800
i i was doing a series of focus groups

954
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
with some industry people

955
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,400
about this time last year and i remember

956
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,839
tony sager saying

957
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,880
and and he's out in the workforce he

958
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,640
said you know i know we talk about those

959
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,720
numbers all the time he said uh melissa

960
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
i don't think we have a really nuanced

961
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,119
understanding of the workforce demand in

962
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,119
cyber security

963
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:45,920
um

964
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,040
so we're lacking that and if you don't

965
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,079
understand the nuances of the demand it

966
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,200
makes it hard to be responsive on

967
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
building out

968
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,359
a supply chain

969
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,200
you know a human supply chain through

970
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
the education system

971
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,440
and then you introduce things like

972
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
artificial intelligence and the whole

973
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,359
speculation that it's eventually going

974
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,760
to make some of the low-level jobs

975
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,599
obsolete and we're not going to need

976
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,760
people doing some of the lower level

977
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,040
functions

978
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,359
is that the case is it not the case how

979
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,880
can you determine at what point

980
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
you don't need some of those

981
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,599
lower

982
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,720
skill lower level jobs

983
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,760
question mark question mark how do you

984
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,240
do that

985
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,440
um so i i tend to think about

986
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
all of these things i tend to think

987
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,000
about pipelines and

988
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,280
pathways and ecosystems and what's the

989
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
problem that

990
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
could be solved what's the problem that

991
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,640
should be solved um

992
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,520
i try to take

993
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,200
tangible action steps to solving some of

994
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,520
them in the absence of certainty

995
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
and in order to do that

996
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,599
i'm always trying to figure out

997
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
where do i get

998
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
the time not just my time

999
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
other people's time to work on these

1000
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,160
important problems

1001
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,200
where do i get the money

1002
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
where do i get

1003
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,720
leaders champions who can help make it

1004
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,960
happen

1005
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,880
how do we move forward on getting some

1006
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,599
actual policy

1007
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,920
um

1008
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,839
and how can you

1009
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,040
how can you form meaningful cooperations

1010
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,279
um

1011
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,280
that support the work

1012
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,160
so i am

1013
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,560
at 5 15 and there's

1014
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,240
two questions in the chat window i

1015
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
haven't had a chance to look at

1016
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,560
um

1017
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,640
i asked if any of this interests you

1018
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,400
please reach out to me

1019
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,520
and i'll

1020
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,680
open it up for questions and suggestions

1021
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
that's great melissa let's look to the q

1022
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
a of the two items there one is in fact

1023
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,760
a question for you

1024
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,359
do you want me to read it to you or you

1025
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,799
want to read it and respond

1026
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,319
since it takes so incredibly long to

1027
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,040
affect k-12 curriculum what ways have

1028
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,280
you identified to get k-12 engaged now

1029
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,359
clubs competitions

1030
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,880
um

1031
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,560
there's not one way

1032
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,760
um

1033
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,359
the the reason

1034
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,560
that i developed the

1035
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,599
guidelines and the teach cyber

1036
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,839
courseware

1037
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,480
the way i developed it is so it could be

1038
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,960
used

1039
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,560
by clubs by competitions

1040
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,880
it could be used in courses it could be

1041
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,160
used

1042
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
in a computer science course it could be

1043
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,240
used in an it course it could be used in

1044
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,800
a cyber security course

1045
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,720
or it could become maybe more than one

1046
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,200
cyber security course

1047
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,040
there's a thing in

1048
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,680
high school education called um perkins

1049
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,119
and perkins money funds it is money that

1050
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,880
high schools can get for a pathway

1051
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,560
in a field and a pathway is usually two

1052
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,040
courses

1053
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
um

1054
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
and because no two schools are in the

1055
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,839
same ecosystem doug

1056
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
no two schools need to build the same

1057
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,680
pipeline

1058
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
and so you have to think of of how you

1059
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,599
develop

1060
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,720
platform capabilities that schools can

1061
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,799
take and customize to their local needs

1062
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
great um

1063
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,520
any other questions

1064
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,319
out there there's one

1065
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,040
um there probably are stats with

1066
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,319
countries

1067
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,839
other than the united states in this

1068
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,000
field um i've i've not

1069
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
and and spaff said earlier my work might

1070
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,960
even have had an impact internationally

1071
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,119
um if it has

1072
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,920
i'm not aware of it and i've ne i've

1073
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,040
intentionally not sought

1074
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,800
to try to go anything bigger than the

1075
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,720
united states there's days i feel like

1076
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,560
i'm up to my ears and alligators just

1077
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
trying to do something meaningful in the

1078
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,359
united states

1079
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
well we know in other countries they're

1080
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,599
introducing

1081
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,880
uh computer science and programming

1082
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,160
at

1083
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,280
levels as low as as second grade

1084
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,640
yeah

1085
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,880
so the fact that

1086
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
basically half of our schools have

1087
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,680
nothing

1088
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,200
in computer science yet indicates we are

1089
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,640
really a bit behind where some other

1090
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,400
countries are

1091
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,000
yeah

1092
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,200
uh oh more questions popping up for you

1093
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,760
this is a good question um teaching

1094
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,079
methods inquiry

1095
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,400
um inquiry based learning project based

1096
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,839
learning explicit direct instruction

1097
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,440
um when we built the the teach cyber

1098
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,040
courseware we thought about using

1099
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,599
project-based learning

1100
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,559
were

1101
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,960
big proponents for project-based

1102
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,160
learning

1103
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,160
and inquiry approaches

1104
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,000
um the reason we didn't do it is because

1105
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,800
then it creates a more

1106
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,760
dependent curriculum where

1107
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,319
everything feeds towards this ultimate

1108
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,040
project and if you can't do the ultimate

1109
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,880
project then it's hard to take the

1110
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
pieces and decompose it

1111
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,040
and for the reason i mentioned earlier

1112
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,119
we wanted something that was really

1113
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,559
adaptable and flexible

1114
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,160
so we do do a lot of active learning and

1115
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,559
a lot of hands-on learning one of our

1116
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,520
rules of thumb was that no class should

1117
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,920
have any more than 10 minutes of teacher

1118
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,000
talk time and then students should be

1119
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
actively thinking and doing

1120
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,440
but it's

1121
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,720
it our active learning is composed at a

1122
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,079
much more

1123
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,880
granular level than of course across the

1124
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,700
trajectory of the whole class

1125
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,160
[Music]

1126
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,520
um

1127
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
well thank you very much

1128
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
um your question is how important do i

1129
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,280
think

1130
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,839
gamified cyber security

1131
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,400
is

1132
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,720
um

1133
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,839
i'm not sure

1134
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,960
yancey exactly what you mean by by

1135
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,079
gamification um sometimes that word

1136
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,040
means

1137
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,960
different things

1138
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,760
um i'm inferring

1139
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,520
that you mean a little bit about

1140
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,319
competitions when you ask about

1141
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,119
adversarial thinking

1142
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,000
sometimes people literally just mean

1143
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,720
a game like i have seen cyber security

1144
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,160
card games

1145
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,240
and and they call that the gamification

1146
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,359
of cyber security

1147
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,400
um

1148
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,920
the the department of energy project

1149
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
that we're gonna work on to bring their

1150
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
you you know how they've had that doe

1151
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,359
argon sponsors that competition staff i

1152
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,440
think purdue students have participated

1153
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,200
in the argonne competition

1154
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,200
and so this is going to be a high school

1155
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,040
version of it we're going to pilot test

1156
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,200
it this spring that'll be my first time

1157
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,520
to be involved in a in a competition

1158
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,759
um

1159
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,839
i think

1160
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,119
that a competition doesn't guarantee

1161
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,599
that you are creating

1162
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,119
students who have the ability to

1163
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,400
think about

1164
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,720
adversaries and about adversity

1165
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,480
um my impression from what i've read in

1166
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,200
the literature and the students who i do

1167
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,000
do know who have talked competed in

1168
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,359
competitions um

1169
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
is that it sometimes can be a rinse and

1170
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,119
repeat and it doesn't necessarily hone

1171
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,000
in them the ability to constantly think

1172
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,960
about the unknown

1173
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,400
and to read

1174
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,119
something that is happening and to put

1175
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,440
together

1176
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
in the face of uncertainty

1177
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,280
in a systematic way

1178
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,359
both to try to make conclusions about

1179
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,680
what might be happening and to form

1180
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
actions about what to do about what

1181
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,520
might be happening

1182
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,359
even though you don't have proof that

1183
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,440
that's what's happening so you have to

1184
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,599
always keep your mind open to the fact

1185
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,559
that you could be wrong

1186
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,800
so that ability to both act on judgment

1187
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,079
at the same time that you're suspending

1188
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,400
final judgment

1189
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,640
um

1190
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,200
i think are some of the pieces of what

1191
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,240
it means to think about adversaries and

1192
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,440
to think about adversity

1193
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,760
um

1194
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,480
so if i were going to try to approach

1195
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,720
answering this question that's the the

1196
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,040
mindset i would take

1197
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,920
you know what does it mean to think

1198
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,000
adversarially

1199
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,079
and then how do you design a learning

1200
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,680
experience that

1201
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,480
that does that

1202
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,680
i hope that helps

1203
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,720
yeah i thought you meant competitions

1204
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,160
um cyber security interacting with other

1205
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,839
school subjects

1206
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,359
um

1207
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,079
such a great question

1208
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:40,960
um

1209
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,040
i have seen

1210
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,599
cyber security

1211
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,720
taught in and taught by librarians

1212
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,880
social studies teachers

1213
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,559
science teachers english teachers

1214
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:59,720
math teachers music teachers

1215
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,759
special ed teachers

1216
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,880
um

1217
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,640
sometimes it's cyber security sometimes

1218
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,839
it's cyber safety

1219
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,559
i'm actually a big

1220
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,119
advocate for the idea

1221
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,920
of cyber security being taught across

1222
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,079
the curriculum

1223
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,040
um

1224
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,319
the idea of that

1225
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,720
but it's so much harder than it sounds

1226
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,640
um

1227
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,920
if you want

1228
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,599
and there's a lot of research um

1229
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
on on teaching

1230
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,400
novices where you're teaching subjects

1231
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,160
that you think they should be able to

1232
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,240
make the connection between but if you

1233
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,960
don't teach them together and explicitly

1234
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,119
make the connection they're unable to

1235
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,119
make it

1236
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,280
they're novices

1237
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,920
it means baf is an expert he might be

1238
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,200
able to see two things and connect them

1239
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,160
right away in cyber security

1240
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,240
but that is because he has

1241
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,598
decades of experience and novices don't

1242
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,680
and so i think sometimes we have to

1243
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,359
think carefully about trying to spread

1244
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,319
cyber security across the curriculum and

1245
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,480
june pay this might not be exactly what

1246
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,599
you mean

1247
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,880
um

1248
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,400
but that's where i took the question

1249
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,319
obviously

1250
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,960
spreading it across the curriculum

1251
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,799
um

1252
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,720
because the curriculum is so crowded

1253
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,880
that the school can't teach a dedicated

1254
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,440
cyber security course

1255
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,680
i think that has to be approached with a

1256
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,799
lot of caution and probably just as much

1257
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,200
rigor

1258
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,400
as trying to put time and money into to

1259
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,000
a dedicated cyber security course

1260
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,920
um hi doug wrap

1261
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,119
um

1262
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,200
pathways that have funding tied to them

1263
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,319
yes

1264
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,920
um

1265
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,040
i.t was included but cyber security has

1266
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,280
not specifically been included by the

1267
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,640
department of education i think that

1268
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,839
that is true i think that states are

1269
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,280
trying

1270
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,079
to

1271
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,359
move towards cybersecurity pathways

1272
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,040
we're going to take our teach cyber

1273
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,920
courseware probably

1274
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,720
sometime in the next six months

1275
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,200
and we're going to split it into two

1276
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,280
courses in response to multiple requests

1277
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,480
from maryland because if it were split

1278
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,119
into a two-year sequence

1279
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,440
it could be a cybersecurity pathway in

1280
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,079
maryland

1281
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,760
i've seen some early indicators that

1282
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,079
indiana wants a course i haven't seen an

1283
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,240
indication that they want a

1284
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,680
two-year pathway in cyber security yet

1285
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
doug

1286
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,839
um

1287
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,319
i would love it if they would

1288
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,839
well great

1289
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,880
we are out of questions and out of time

1290
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,880
yeah so that was very nicely scheduled

1291
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,760
uh

1292
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,200
thank you so much for presenting today

1293
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,559
um

1294
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,040
before we log off i just wanted just to

1295
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,640
say thank you

1296
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,839
you know much of the last 22 years of my

1297
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,119
career

1298
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,760
um which i've really enjoyed

1299
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,280
um

1300
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,240
stems back to you

1301
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,680
well

1302
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,960
i thank you um sometimes i'm sometimes

1303
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,640
i'm blamed for

1304
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,520
uh decades

1305
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,920
i mean a lot of this stuff i'm i've done

1306
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,359
but you were a real source of

1307
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,319
inspiration for a lot of it

1308
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,520
well thank you

1309
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,480
um

1310
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,640
well you're you're not done yet there's

1311
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,160
a lot left to do

1312
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,079
and you're going to continue to do some

1313
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,480
great things for those in the audience

1314
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,960
who are interested in further uh

1315
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,440
conversation on this topic

1316
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,079
melissa has had her

1317
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,760
