1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,940
good afternoon and this welcome to this

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,460
week's security seminar from from Sirius

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,080
at Purdue University

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,320
our uh speakers are from Microsoft this

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,059
morning or this afternoon we have two

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,240
speakers uh abalasha bhargav spangle is

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,699
a partner security architect and sunny

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,220
at the cloud is a principal program

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,500
manager uh welcome to you both

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,019
thank you Jill it's great to be here

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
and it's really really wonderful to meet

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,520
our students as Joel mentioned

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,300
I am a very proud Purdue Alum I I call

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,000
it my second home with a lot of the

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,600
hallways in serious and meeting everyone

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,480
um was any opportunity to follow up on

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,000
that would be great

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,100
um I start sharing and as I introduce

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,559
myself and Sony we can talk about the

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,339
topic for today

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
please let me know if you can

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,860
see the screen

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,960
yes yes the slides look good perfect

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
so

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,759
um so I'm abhilasha and I um I I did my

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,880
undergrad graduate PhD at uh at Purdue

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,700
and it was focused on it was like a kid

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,619
in a candy store it was focused on a lot

29
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,840
of interesting challenges a Common

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,600
Thread was cyber security and I can tell

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
you after two decades it doesn't each

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,460
day is so special and there's so much to

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,000
offer and do in such an area so today

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm really excited to be here with you

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,759
to talk about some things that are of

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,100
growing importance and

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,860
um I am joined here with my esteemed

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,840
colleague Sony who would introduce

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,860
himself and uh one liner about the topic

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,220
for today

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,439
sunny

42
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,000
Sunny we cannot hear you

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,440
how about now yeah

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,329
[Music]

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,599
so I think there is a bit of a

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,980
microphone issue there but we'll we'll

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,220
take it as it comes right

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,060
so

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,440
um

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
now we can hear you okay

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,599
why don't you go ahead while we figure

52
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,980
this out

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
sounds good

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,560
so I hope in the audience you still have

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,780
some folks who have seen the latest

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,180
Avengers but the quote comes with the

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,280
idea of

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,160
um we as technologists have a great

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,319
responsibility because the kind of

60
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,140
influence that we are having in the

61
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,040
world today is more than ever before so

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,319
you might have seen some of these stats

63
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,180
and some may be new but there's no

64
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,840
question that the number of uh users

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,180
billions of users 5 out of 8 billion

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,840
users are on the internet some uh for

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
recreation but more so for their

68
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,459
day-to-day lives their jobs Healthcare

69
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,239
in every possible way understanding what

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,140
is how do you provide the right level of

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,440
um the right level of security was very

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,379
evident so for example

73
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,220
um all the reports that show up that the

74
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,099
integral role of technology in our

75
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,440
day-to-day resulted in most of the

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,019
business is easy that cyber security and

77
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,480
resilience is the top priority

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,060
this is preaching to the choir this is a

79
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,780
serious crowd so understanding what

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,540
um what in what is the kind of impact is

81
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,879
I think when we are in the university

82
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,239
area we understand as a user right that

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,640
as a user the impact of identity theft

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,659
that was uh my thesis also on how do we

85
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,360
protect the users against identity theft

86
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,560
it's been many years and the pro the

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
problem has grown not just because not

88
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,639
because we didn't do anything about it

89
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,500
there's tremendous progress people

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,120
didn't think of multi-factor

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,259
authentication early on in early 2000s

92
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,400
and now it's and now it is more uh I

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
hope everybody has multi-factor

94
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
authentication turned on for their key

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,340
services and it's become one of those

96
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,320
things which is taken for granted that's

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
a good thing however we have a number of

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,540
technologies that are being built on

99
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,000
identities we tend to repeat some of

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
those issues foreign

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,100
so being able to see how to reduce the

102
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,620
impact on users it's a lot more than

103
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,900
losing an email account it's a it's your

104
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,259
whole your identity as uh from your

105
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,300
physical actual identity to your

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,720
pseudonym and your persona is very

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,540
um is very marked right because at this

108
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,479
point it to recover from an identity

109
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,960
that will require a ton of work so the

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,940
customer impact the user impact into

111
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,639
their livelihoods into their families

112
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,400
Etc is a lot more than ever before

113
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,759
next thing related to the user impact is

114
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,699
key the next thing which is also

115
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,440
probably not news to you but this

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,740
becomes really interesting so I hope in

117
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,600
the Q a section I'll come to know about

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,940
areas of research from our various

119
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,680
students data is an obvious you know a

120
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,720
source of how we are going to be

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
building a lot of the Cyber Security

122
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,580
Solutions so cyber security is reliance

123
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,360
on data is not a surprise but how can we

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
manage the volume of data so that

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,539
Security operation centers

126
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,940
investigations threat hunting and all

127
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,639
the proactive and reactive processes

128
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,520
related to these incidents is well taken

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
care of

130
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,539
so I'm proud to be part of one of the

131
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,039
world's largest security operations

132
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,560
center and seeing the day-to-day its

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
actual human beings behind the scene and

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
what is happening is in this data comes

135
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,740
the nice really interesting challenges

136
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,919
of how we can identify and protect

137
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,500
critical Services there was a talk from

138
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,259
Professor spafford now

139
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,680
end of 90s or early 2000s which is super

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,120
relevant even today the in the identify

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,419
protect detect response pillars the

142
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,340
response and Recovery is sometimes an

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,380
afterthought people think that hey I've

144
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,840
designed my most perfect solution but

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,220
you one should know that it's just

146
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,080
matter of time that it's going to fail

147
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,979
and

148
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,039
are you making your system ready to be

149
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,860
brought up again to be able to recover

150
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,220
to do the root cause analysis and these

151
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,479
impacts

152
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
um these incidents impact users

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,060
tremendously so the speed at which we

154
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,880
can do it greatly depends on how we are

155
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,800
doing this data governance how are we

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,419
making sure we're collecting the right

157
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,800
data with uh efficiencies and Sony is

158
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
going to talk about a really interesting

159
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
angle to it which we haven't

160
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,500
traditionally considered and super

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,840
important in today's day and age so

162
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,139
investments in understanding analyzing

163
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,479
data is never more important

164
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,880
one thing which I have learned myself a

165
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,699
lot about over the last year or so is

166
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,460
the security operations center

167
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,440
I wish I could actually see their faces

168
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,180
and I would ask to raise an in a typical

169
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,599
serious seminar but here

170
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
um it would be interesting to know how

171
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
many people are familiar with the

172
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,940
security operations center

173
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,539
it's really interesting that it is the

174
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,840
front doors to all the big organizations

175
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,860
it gets a threat intelligence data from

176
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,400
across the globe billions of events uh

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,639
per week being able to make informed

178
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,400
decisions comes from a lot of context

179
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,699
that context is so critical because the

180
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,780
same piece of data in um and you know in

181
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,879
in a standalone fashion would not be

182
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,919
actionable but if you put it together

183
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,379
with an other threat Intel we are able

184
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,899
to start forming investigations being

185
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,779
able to identify incidents being able to

186
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,719
create detections

187
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,419
queries that will look for a needle in a

188
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,660
haystack and that Haystack is huge the

189
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,800
ability to take that uh thread Intel and

190
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,300
identifying incidents saying hey

191
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,980
something is wrong we've got to go do

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,200
that that's the second part It's The

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,940
Incident Management things will happen

194
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,640
and it happens and we don't want to be

195
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,240
able to miss anything being able to go

196
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,519
protect the customers we talked about so

197
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,459
being able to have communication so the

198
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,620
interdisciplinary nature of how serious

199
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,339
and how Purdue programs are is extremely

200
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,920
useful because what it allows you to do

201
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,600
is to take take a lot of different

202
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,959
aspects look at legal you go off to

203
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,640
Granite and understand some of the legal

204
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,920
aspects of it you go off to psychology

205
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
and understand what is needed to help

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
make the you know de-escalate and

207
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,000
understand how to manage the risk being

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,519
able to understand the technology the

209
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
the network the crypto the different

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
aspects of what the data breaches are

211
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,740
all about and then it comes down to

212
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,140
analyzing it at different layers top

213
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,839
level analysis use machine learning and

214
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,860
automation to respond uh to the attacks

215
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,140
that are well known a lot of reuse or

216
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,420
vulnerabilities that that are being

217
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,480
released and then as we go to lower

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,240
tiers it requires deeper and deeper look

219
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,640
and these are actual human beings who

220
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,220
are spending day and night protecting

221
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,459
as many customers as many users as they

222
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,860
can to reduce that impact

223
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,140
how they do it is also very interesting

224
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,180
you may be very familiar with the miter

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,680
attack framework

226
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,459
as a theoretical as a concept which is

227
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,800
which has been proven over many many

228
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
years I think there have been multiple

229
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
talks in the serious seminars About It

230
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,880
by people who actually designed it it's

231
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,700
actually very useful and the first thing

232
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,399
an investigator would do is start

233
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,019
looking it doesn't start from left to

234
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,380
right really it starts from making sure

235
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,360
for example you understand which

236
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,579
credential was access then we discover

237
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,000
what all was what was the blast radius

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,519
how far did this attack reach and then

239
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,160
go back and forth to better understand

240
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,560
the scope of the attack and root cause

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,040
it so an investigation the miter attack

242
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,860
framework is a really good one to allow

243
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,480
one to actually go investigate various

244
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,720
areas one thing that will be good to

245
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,019
consider in your research is also to see

246
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,180
what are the different types of

247
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,880
mitigation uh defense in depth you know

248
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,060
like are you only thinking of the first

249
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,860
time

250
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,240
exposure don't have too many ports open

251
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,839
you know security by default there's a

252
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,640
really great presentation

253
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,779
uh which talks about rethinking security

254
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,160
looking at the good known States bad

255
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
known States and reducing the exposure

256
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,600
to start with then is the initial access

257
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,060
you know like we I'm sure in the

258
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,220
security courses you'll be learning all

259
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,160
sorts of Access Control models and how

260
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,480
we can reduce you know privileged access

261
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,720
need to know basis and being able to

262
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
reduce the threat along those lines the

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,700
initial access is also very much related

264
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,980
to an area which is close to heart which

265
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,160
is identity authentication while you

266
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
take care of the privacy of the user how

267
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
do you make sure that the initial access

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,660
is easy like you're not doing a ritual

269
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,300
around the PC to be able to log in but

270
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,180
at the same time you have some kind of

271
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,720
non-repudiation it doesn't allow

272
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,839
Sony to log in as me because my my

273
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,380
credentials represent me in this vast

274
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,339
set of services that I highly depend on

275
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,500
the execution is really interesting and

276
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,060
that's where a lot of the logging and uh

277
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,519
for those who may be familiar with log4j

278
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,279
um logging it's like salt in a pantry

279
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,680
okay since you might have heard it you

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,540
have logging everywhere you're logging

281
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,240
execution but then so protect the

282
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,519
protector if you're using logging making

283
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,500
sure it's logged in a secure fashion

284
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,800
using libraries that are up to date and

285
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,040
um this type of execution failures would

286
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,899
be also detected as part of the

287
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,779
investigation what typically an attacker

288
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,920
would do is

289
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,839
find a vulnerability in some of this

290
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,180
executable and have an elevation of

291
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,540
privilege then we'll look at other ways

292
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,860
to create more credentials that can give

293
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,320
more and more access across the system

294
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,899
the cloud system is extremely

295
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,120
interesting in applying

296
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,220
um the same type of framework but in

297
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,440
considering the entire Cloud as one

298
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,160
operating system versus separate PCS so

299
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,200
happy to chat with folks who want to go

300
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,420
deeper into this as a research area

301
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,519
instead of Standalone system now

302
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,180
considering the cloud as your

303
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,880
platform and understand what it means to

304
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,740
protect against these types of attacks

305
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,519
at every level

306
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,579
next thing is understanding the Privacy

307
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,700
so it goes hand in hand I remember while

308
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,480
looking at the

309
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
authentication and some of the areas

310
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,880
some of the previous talks was all about

311
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,779
strong authentication without

312
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,600
jeopardizing the Privacy so the ability

313
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
to take uh you know even for logging and

314
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,440
taking a ton of data to be able to

315
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,139
protect risk respond recover from

316
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,420
attacks we always keep the Privacy

317
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,060
concentrations to the top it's baked

318
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,120
into the design because it everything in

319
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
security is like a double-edged sword so

320
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,320
if we are collecting data with the right

321
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,860
principles we also need it by Design to

322
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,320
protect the privacy and come not just

323
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
comply with the regulations which we

324
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,579
should but also take it forward like

325
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,860
innovate and see what are some smart

326
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,800
ways of delivering some of this

327
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,760
so bottom line here is that the security

328
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,160
operations center has a lot of key

329
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,680
operations you know from collecting

330
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,959
petabytes and petabytes are logs it has

331
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,360
billions of scanning happening every

332
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,639
single day understanding

333
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,440
um

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,639
understanding the various threat Intel

335
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,800
information coming from across the globe

336
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,620
correlating them and then reporting it

337
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,480
there are some very interesting research

338
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,240
areas in just visualizing this data and

339
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,339
being able to see it in that single pane

340
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,540
which

341
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,880
it's really for 15 years I haven't seen

342
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
a single thing which will give you that

343
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,980
one single pin of glass but we can have

344
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,560
some really good representations that we

345
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,060
can collectively use

346
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,360
the ability to not just see the

347
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,060
information as is but infer things infer

348
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,519
a trend the knowledge base increases

349
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,820
with the depth of understanding what

350
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,139
what the attacker is after being able to

351
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,360
bring together a large number of people

352
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,300
through ticketing through security

353
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,459
incident event management the seam

354
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,860
systems you know which are growing more

355
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,500
and more across the globe correlating

356
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,240
data from

357
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,540
all sources and building intelligence to

358
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,180
be able to go protect everyone

359
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,360
so hopefully the soft part was

360
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,399
interesting that's just an intro I can

361
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,139
give you a bunch of really good books

362
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,300
and references it's not something that

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,180
we traditionally focus on but it is

364
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,800
really really

365
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,260
um interesting to take a look because no

366
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,420
matter how much we Harden and protect

367
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,959
our Solutions what we have learned is

368
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,000
that we still have to be ready for

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
failures and how we respond to it how

370
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,339
effective we make us up is a very

371
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,500
important area that needs further

372
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,120
attention

373
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,399
the part that we haven't talked about at

374
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,620
all is how we start green and at this

375
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,660
point I will transition to Sunny because

376
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,300
it's such a critical part uh in today's

377
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,759
world please go ahead

378
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,220
okay thank you so much I believe you can

379
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,199
hear me is that correct

380
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,079
awesome awesome thank you abhilasha and

381
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,299
and thank you the Purdue Community I

382
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,980
know I didn't introduce myself earlier

383
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,839
on when I had

384
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,480
um issues with the the microphone that

385
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,099
has been fixed it's part of Technology

386
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,740
the reality is that we deal with today

387
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,339
so I have my attachment to Purdue by

388
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,859
having two of my sons graduate from

389
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,799
Purdue in the last 10 years and I have

390
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,900
two more that will be attending Purdue

391
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,320
one in 20 20 26 and the other coming in

392
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,960
in 2030. so that that tells you the

393
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,840
decision has been made

394
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,539
now I believe I did a great uh job

395
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,500
telling us about how data is and how

396
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,380
important data is to our future to our

397
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,780
Collective future in that Collective

398
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,059
future we must work together to defend

399
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,000
to protect and to build in this in a

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
very sustainable way in a way that leads

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,900
us into preserving our future into in

402
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,299
into the the longer future that we have

403
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,780
as opposed to uh enjoying all we can

404
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,880
today and destroying the future that we

405
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,400
currently have and so again my call

406
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,740
today to call the abolition I if you put

407
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,200
all the two presentations together it's

408
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,720
a call to encourage everybody to do your

409
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,440
part

410
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,620
to see yourself as part of this the

411
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,580
solution to see yourself as part of the

412
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,320
future building the future and creating

413
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
the future that all of us will happily

414
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,539
get to one day and be happy that we

415
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,419
thought about making good decisions in

416
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,880
the past that translates into those

417
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
benefits that gets us into that

418
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,679
Collective future that we all desire so

419
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,500
to start with I want to focus on some of

420
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,480
the sustainability principles why do we

421
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,419
do this why do we have to even focus on

422
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,520
sustainability at all why not just

423
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,039
continue to build as we as we've always

424
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,679
done the other aspect I want to Pivot on

425
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,640
is looking at the the environment that

426
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,620
supports the data uh engine that that

427
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,720
ablasha talked about how do we secure

428
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,820
that environment how do we secure the

429
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,520
the the the data centers how do we

430
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,580
secure the the stock environments so

431
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,220
that this business of men maintaining

432
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,280
preserving a security posture can be

433
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,760
realized so starting off I've always you

434
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,039
know caveat on the fact that we must

435
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,140
start green and I think ablation also

436
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,600
referred to that earlier on we must

437
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,539
start green and starting green means we

438
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,640
must go back to the basics of of

439
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,640
responsible action and that responsible

440
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,860
action starts with every single one of

441
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,600
us even if you're a student today you

442
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,940
can begin to look at yourself and say

443
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,039
what part do I have to play in this

444
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,980
where is my place in this in the

445
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,440
spectrum of work that defines a

446
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
collective future for for ourselves now

447
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,640
any principle that is not hinged on

448
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,919
involving and including the community

449
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,559
that has been built for has failed to

450
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,960
begin with in which case when we talk

451
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,940
about studying green we want to make

452
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,400
sure that we understand the community

453
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,620
that we're building for we want to

454
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,480
understand ourselves we want to

455
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,280
understand the people that we're also

456
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,440
building for and we also have to

457
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,080
understand that we have a collective

458
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,380
responsibility to build doing nothing is

459
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,780
not an option

460
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
now there are key

461
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,419
business Investments and very huge

462
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,120
investment in building for example a

463
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,919
data center

464
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,020
and by data center let me describe what

465
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,520
that is for those who are not familiar

466
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,980
with with what a data center is the data

467
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,980
center is where into this world where

468
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,960
you the all of the collection of

469
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,059
information comes with the information

470
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,820
stored and information is shared and

471
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,220
distributed so it's almost like a

472
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,580
storage house call it that and but that

473
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,400
means if all of the information that we

474
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,620
have petabytes upon petabytes of

475
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,240
information that we have must be

476
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,120
preserve it must be protected as we all

477
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,179
know data is King and people are out

478
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,059
after all of the data that we have and

479
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,520
companies and individuals maliciously

480
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,940
have treaded to play with with people's

481
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,640
data and the scale at which that is

482
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,900
going also calls for a careful design of

483
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,539
the data center environment

484
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,539
now in talking about sustainability the

485
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,520
key three key parents principles or

486
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,559
three key points pillars that we all

487
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,020
always look to and that is the people

488
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,440
the process and the technology and as we

489
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,960
build a lot of this

490
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,780
in bringing in those green ideas those

491
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,880
green Innovation those Green Solutions

492
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,059
we must focus on conserving all of our

493
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,640
resources and in conserving those

494
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,500
resources it means we must build with

495
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,860
the future in mind we must build knowing

496
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,080
that yes there's a landscape that we

497
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,140
must defend and that that that that data

498
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,780
center is important to me as much as as

499
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,480
today is important to the community that

500
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,360
we support and in starting green it

501
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,280
means we must start right starting with

502
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,500
the right approach starting with the

503
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
right people starting with the right

504
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,320
mindset to bring about a collective

505
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,200
Collective knowledge knowledge base that

506
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,480
helps to Define that future that design

507
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,000
in a way that it makes sense in a way

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
that it is beautiful and not only

509
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,380
beautiful but is sustainable and not

510
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,840
only that it preserves and adds to that

511
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,720
preservation of our Collective future

512
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
again the call has always been the one

513
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
that includes all of us one thing I want

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,940
to mention in terms of sustainability

515
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,559
within Innovation is the fact that

516
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,740
it start it starts with you

517
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,440
don't look to the other person it starts

518
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,460
with you

519
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,580
and it starts with me in my case and how

520
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,860
do we make sure that we can manage this

521
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,840
environment in a in a responsible

522
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,020
fashion if we all do our part in a way

523
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,500
that is responsible in a way that is

524
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,860
sustainable in a way that is smart call

525
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,919
is smart then we can Define and look

526
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
forward to that future that we all want

527
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
to have again sustainability by itself

528
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,440
it's key also Innovation all by itself

529
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,679
without being responsible it's a failure

530
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,320
and that is very clearly defined in in

531
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
all of our contexts here that we must

532
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,980
align with this focus of building

533
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,620
with a future in mind and doing it the

534
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,419
right way the right and the judicious

535
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,159
way

536
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,159
that leads us to talking about the

537
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,080
the data center of the future what are

538
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,820
some of the future considerations that

539
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,039
people have looked at or that accurately

540
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,900
look looking at and in fact in some

541
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,120
cases that future is already here the

542
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,500
future is with us

543
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,480
so you look at the traditional data

544
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,340
center environment there's several

545
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,580
flavors of it where you know somebody an

546
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,059
organization has the means to invest in

547
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,700
a huge data center where you have racks

548
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,039
where you have all of your your cables

549
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,080
coming in and you have your redundancy

550
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,000
for for that data center and you have

551
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,400
all of the power that comes into that

552
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,620
Center these are key design elements

553
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,360
that uh should be considered in building

554
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,580
a data center in this data set

555
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,000
environment what has always happened is

556
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,980
people just build

557
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,500
and that was 10 15 years ago when this

558
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,340
whole drive for for data uh the scale of

559
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,500
data that we deal with began people

560
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,640
started just build it now what what got

561
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,039
us here it's not enough to get us into

562
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,640
the future the mistakes of the past

563
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,380
cannot

564
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,720
be repeated to get us to that future

565
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,299
that we just we deserve we desire for

566
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,700
that reason we must

567
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,460
take a step backwards and look at what

568
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,500
we did in the past that was wrong the

569
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,480
things that went wrong and how can we

570
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,159
correct those wrongs and how can we

571
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,620
begin to innovate in a way that we can

572
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,080
build a future that makes sense so

573
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,980
looking at the data center as an example

574
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,500
people came in and built

575
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,380
and in the in the next future if

576
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,299
everybody would continue to build in

577
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,559
that sense

578
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,740
the the blast radius or look at it this

579
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,720
way the amount of space that will be

580
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,860
consumed

581
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,020
it's not sustainable at all

582
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,179
and So you you're beginning to see it's

583
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,220
already happening where companies are

584
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,059
coming together to build and align along

585
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,640
the lines of data sharing agreements

586
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,400
along the lines of of sharing resources

587
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
and we talked about co-location has been

588
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,200
one of those uh opportunities where

589
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
people instead of you know replicating

590
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,580
data centers all over the place people

591
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,860
are able to co-locate we come together

592
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,100
and we agree on you know all of the

593
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,020
shared opportunities and we build a data

594
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,419
center together or somebody builds and

595
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,360
is able to lease a sublease to others

596
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,179
those are great ideas that that's

597
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,640
already taken taken ship in in a in our

598
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,140
current experience

599
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,100
the overall goal is to build and drive

600
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,860
towards that Net Zero carbon emission

601
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,000
meaning that building it's not creating

602
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,100
any uh carbon emission

603
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,400
over what it's stopping

604
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,159
and that is a key element in design if

605
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,500
every data center is built in the future

606
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
tracks to that zero Net Zero carbon

607
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,039
emission that is a big win not only for

608
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,220
the owner or the investor it is a win

609
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
for the community

610
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,720
and how about modular and minimal

611
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,220
footprint

612
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,799
module designs are quick to assemble

613
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,799
that's also taken shape within the data

614
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,980
center environment today we we spread in

615
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,559
terms of expansion along horizontal

616
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,539
lines

617
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,720
people are working on the idea of a

618
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,900
vertical vertical expansion

619
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,320
so as to reduce the spread on the on the

620
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,260
horizontal space of land

621
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,360
and these ideas that have been talked

622
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,159
about and have been worked on and if

623
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,980
anyone is interested we can find who you

624
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,659
know those areas that people that are

625
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,000
doing great things as it relates to Data

626
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,860
Centers and get you plugged into those

627
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,279
conversations but again it it comes back

628
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,580
to the point where as a student as a

629
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,840
professional

630
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,120
you have a part to play

631
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,520
and this includes and involves every

632
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
single one of us

633
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,539
and if I may add to a little bit of why

634
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,480
how this relates to cyber security

635
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,820
cyber security has taken a different

636
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,299
note in terms of

637
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,779
we have you know nation state becoming

638
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,080
you know threat actors taking active uh

639
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,960
interests in this area Warfare of the

640
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,460
future

641
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,279
has been predicted to hinge on how well

642
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,220
you can take down the services of the

643
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,840
other host nation

644
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,419
and so if you look at it in that sense

645
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,720
cyber security is a key area

646
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,700
for consideration

647
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,860
now that is the future that we cannot

648
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,320
run away from in that sense how can we

649
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,559
build with that future in mind today

650
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,080
what are those actions that each each

651
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,360
one of each of us can take

652
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,000
to to build and to take us to that

653
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,820
desired future that we all want

654
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,580
technology is built on resilience ground

655
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,640
up that resiliency is something that

656
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,159
collectively

657
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,520
we can do way more and become externally

658
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,080
resilient

659
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,600
it also involves everybody bringing your

660
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,340
share bringing your share of knowledge

661
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,220
to the table we're not only together it

662
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,900
becomes more

663
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,960
what may not be obvious to me is clearly

664
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,820
obvious through the last year and I can

665
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,919
lean on her expertise I can lean on her

666
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,320
knowledge to make that into the design

667
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,659
to build that into the into the

668
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,260
architecture

669
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,240
sometimes we might say that Community

670
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,360
should protect themselves

671
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,480
it's it's not just that

672
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,659
the community's need to walk and be

673
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,500
educated be be be be aware of their

674
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,140
surrounding be aware of of what cyber

675
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,720
security is and until somebody takes

676
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,840
this and makes this calls this out

677
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,279
sometimes the communities will be faced

678
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,440
and and maybe focused on other things

679
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,320
besides cyber security we need to make

680
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,840
sure every member of the community is

681
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
aware of the dangers of cyber security

682
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,539
and also the opportunities to

683
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,460
collaborate the opportunities to do

684
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
something about it

685
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,240
and let's talk about those conservation

686
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,399
principles baked into the fabric of the

687
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,440
community that awareness that

688
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,320
Consciousness that says thanks for as

689
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,120
simple as and I give this example to a

690
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,760
friend of mine as simple as

691
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,760
the the right to repair you have a you

692
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
have a battery if the life of that

693
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,440
battery can be extended to a longer

694
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,659
period of time can be extended guess

695
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,860
what

696
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,799
that is less that does better for the

697
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,299
community that does better for the

698
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,820
environment that's the going green how

699
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,860
can we bake and build those things into

700
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,960
the fabric of our community what can

701
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,419
each individual do instead of looking to

702
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,340
the other person and say what can you do

703
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,559
or what can the government do for me

704
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,200
they are the idea is what can I do what

705
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,899
is my place in this in this fight of

706
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,719
creating a better future for all of us

707
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,100
and so we'll talk a little bit about the

708
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,140
design the design thinking and the

709
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,640
things that go into

710
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,700
uh the ideas of of collaboration the

711
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,620
idea of working together with the

712
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,779
community to make sure that when we're

713
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,419
building the designs and and focusing on

714
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,299
the design of of the considerations that

715
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,399
lead to a better future what are those

716
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,380
things that that make it such that it

717
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,779
can be repeated that is repeatable that

718
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,340
is scalable

719
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,580
the idea then is to start with the

720
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,260
community in mind

721
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,840
then you divide you define exactly what

722
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,039
you're looking for

723
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,159
you ideate on it you do a prototype you

724
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,460
test it and then you go back and

725
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,320
reiterate the whole process again but

726
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,440
the key Point here is you must involve

727
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,440
the community you must understand the

728
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,659
people that you're building for you must

729
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,360
understand the audience and you must

730
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,399
bring some include them include the

731
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,159
audience in the design process include

732
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,200
them in the future that you're defining

733
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,240
and designing for them

734
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,200
and so to do this it's a call on all of

735
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,140
us one idea that we we talked about in

736
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,140
the sense also is knowing that

737
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,860
data center design is taking a new shape

738
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,899
in terms of you know service level

739
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,940
agreements that I put it been put in

740
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,740
place where data center will now be

741
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,260
offered as a service meaning I build a

742
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,539
data center I own it and then you come

743
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,659
to me and buy you know you know the

744
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,419
space or data from me and I support you

745
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,720
in that sense and that's all you pay for

746
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,600
the idea then also is that student I

747
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,039
mean students can you know do some

748
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
research into this because it's the

749
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,820
future that's where we're headed and I

750
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,740
know that as we walk through that future

751
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,779
it'd be an interesting area for the

752
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,059
students to engage very quickly and

753
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,740
students have great ideas because

754
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,960
they've now been exposed very much to

755
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,520
some of the challenges of what they're

756
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,899
able to think outside the box and

757
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,000
challenge you know status quo we love

758
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,940
that another thought idea that I would

759
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,440
throw out to any student that's willing

760
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,179
to consider is careful deconstruction

761
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,640
and reuse that's an area that we haven't

762
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,980
you know really invested you know time

763
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,740
in for example there's a building you

764
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,140
tear that building down and everything

765
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,620
goes It's hard hold off and and you know

766
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
to the dump

767
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,760
why can't we deconstruct this those

768
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,000
items and reuse them there is a huge

769
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,220
opportunity there it leads to a better

770
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,320
environment for all of us and of course

771
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,659
facility resource and Resource

772
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,940
Management there are a lot of building

773
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,640
information system uh modules that are

774
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,260
out there that again students I

775
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,000
encourage you to invest in those areas

776
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,140
how can we conserve the the use of the

777
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,820
resources that we have at such

778
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,399
facilities you're able to measure and

779
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,679
and put you know bring down your your

780
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,320
spend on maintaining the facility for

781
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,840
you know to under three three percent on

782
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,640
average is from five to fifteen percent

783
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,219
of any building today you can you can

784
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,000
walk with very you know measurable ideas

785
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
that can bring that that down to three

786
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,599
percent that's a win for the community

787
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,580
it's a win for the investor it's a win

788
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,859
for for everyone those are the kind of

789
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,899
things that we're looking and tracking

790
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:25,159
towards and looking forward to

791
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,940
in talking about the

792
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,639
sort of call for Action this this is

793
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,500
where I want to spend a little bit of

794
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,839
time for for the time and and we welcome

795
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,580
questions we welcome a lot of

796
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,940
interaction uh as we go but the idea is

797
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,280
to promote and Galvanize thought leaders

798
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,619
how can we get leaders together to begin

799
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,379
to consider this huge opportunity that

800
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,399
we have

801
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,159
how can we work together the the

802
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,560
Academia the business Community all

803
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,180
coming together because we have a

804
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,880
collect we have a shared shared future

805
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,040
we must do it together and those

806
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,460
investment practices must succumb to

807
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,140
right mindset and right green processes

808
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,599
those sustainable ideas and ideals that

809
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,460
we all hold there to our hearts those

810
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,800
are the areas that I believe we have a

811
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,839
lot of work to do where are those

812
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,700
thought leaders how can we get them

813
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,579
together so we can start start doing you

814
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,140
know putting our heads together to build

815
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,180
and to Define what that future looks

816
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,300
like and and build towards it we must

817
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,220
prioritize research in responsible

818
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,920
Innovation and this is where you know in

819
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,040
a in a academic environment like this

820
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,800
this is key how much how can we invest

821
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
and push and encourage people to to to

822
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,220
to to research more and do some more

823
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,260
research in this area because there's a

824
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,660
lot to be uncovered there's a lot yet to

825
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,700
be uncovered and we should we should put

826
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,460
a lot of energy into these areas we must

827
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,160
prioritize in resilient data governance

828
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,980
over insurance for risk management today

829
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,020
people would say oh I have insurance

830
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,540
coverage so if my data is exposed if my

831
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,880
building is not protected and secure and

832
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,920
that data leaks out guess what I have

833
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,660
insurance so I don't have to worry about

834
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,180
it that is not the right mindset for

835
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,960
tomorrow

836
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,200
the right mindset is to prioritize the

837
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,940
resilient debt of governance how can we

838
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,280
protect that data you only have it if

839
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,740
you have a need to know if you have no

840
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,140
need to know or access that data you

841
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,540
shouldn't and you wouldn't

842
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,940
and we must also mandate uh

843
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,800
environmental social and governance best

844
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,900
practices how can we get involved with

845
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,820
the right with the right government with

846
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,980
the right regulation to make sure that

847
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,920
these mandates are baked into how we

848
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,140
operate how do we make sure that these

849
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,720
mandates are baked into our curriculum

850
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,359
even in schools so that these are taught

851
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,119
from early on and how can we work to

852
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,579
mandate this Net Zero carbon emissions

853
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,400
for buildings for for new Innovations

854
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,220
for new Investments we must be able to

855
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,339
have a ways to capture the impact of

856
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,220
every investment and in capturing the

857
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,500
the impact of that investment we're able

858
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,359
to even tax

859
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,280
over when you when you go above a

860
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,359
certain level

861
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,280
you got to pay for it because you're

862
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,160
creating a future that's not desirable

863
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,740
and we must prioritize awareness and

864
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,140
educate the community so that everybody

865
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,359
is aware of the little ways that they

866
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,460
can do the little things that they can

867
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,579
do to improve and to engage in this

868
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,880
fight to building a a future that we all

869
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,359
desire the Coalition must be built and

870
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,180
that movement must start now and as we

871
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,119
say must stop now it begins with you and

872
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,579
every one of us here at some point must

873
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,460
have dreamed and does dream to become of

874
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,339
being a hero at some point you still can

875
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,160
be and we throw this opportunity at you

876
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
and this is a great way to be a hero

877
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,420
thank you for this opportunity glad to

878
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,980
be here

879
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,740
back to yabilizer

880
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,200
that was amazing thank you sunny and

881
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,820
Evie I see one uh question from Medina

882
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,040
should we start with that uh Joel

883
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,200
um yes go right ahead Medina is one of

884
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
our PhD candidates so uh she's following

885
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,359
in your footsteps here

886
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,180
that's great you'll do wonderful

887
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,160
um and it's a great question Medina do

888
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,839
you want to elaborate on it or do you

889
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,880
want to talk about the question and then

890
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,760
be

891
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,560
participants are do not have microphone

892
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,339
access so okay so uh go ahead and read

893
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,079
the question and then and then you can

894
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,920
answer it totally so I stopped sharing

895
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,980
um just to make sure

896
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,740
so Medina you had a really good good

897
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,380
question the question is at what size

898
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,480
should an organization or type of

899
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,780
business Beyond critical infrastructure

900
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,820
consider standing up a stock and also

901
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,460
what's your perspective on Outsourcing a

902
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,420
stock

903
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,200
so I have to say that again these are

904
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,660
things about my understanding and I've

905
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,359
been into a brand new shop over the last

906
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,339
year so one thing you will learn is

907
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,020
after Decades of doing cyber security

908
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,000
you'll learn something new every single

909
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,780
day

910
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,240
so after having looked at the sock from

911
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,920
uh first from outside so providing

912
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,980
um there are some things called the

913
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,020
mssps they are managed service security

914
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,780
services provider so we've seen over the

915
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,240
last few years everything is as a

916
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,280
service so you are doing something you

917
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,700
know platform as a service uh we are

918
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,099
looking at uh even a sock as a service

919
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,500
so I earlier on worked with a lot of

920
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,280
managed Security Services providers and

921
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,740
empowering them with tools Technologies

922
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,599
so that they can serve multiple other

923
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,240
organizations so

924
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,880
um sometimes it wasn't the size of the

925
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,720
organization per se that was

926
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,339
requiring standing up a stock it was

927
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,740
also the severity like looking at how

928
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,260
how critical what is the risk associated

929
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,140
with it most of the time it was a

930
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,940
combination at least the ones that I

931
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,740
have experienced is a hybrid model

932
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,420
there's certain things that take care of

933
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,420
themselves and then they also partner

934
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,839
with and security operations center like

935
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,060
that Outsource model you mentioned which

936
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,900
is as a service because there's value in

937
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,380
having a broad uh broad set of cyber

938
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,680
threat Intel there is also the ability

939
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,780
to keep up to date with the type of

940
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,839
Technologies uh that you need to be very

941
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,119
agile because things change very quickly

942
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,280
there was a few years back it was

943
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,079
everything was about ransomware you know

944
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,020
before that there would be some Bots and

945
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,300
things will change the ability to change

946
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,240
with it it requires a lot more flexible

947
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,599
model and the cost frankly is quite uh

948
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,240
high for you know depending on the type

949
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,520
of business and you really need to that

950
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,680
is why some of these Cloud models are

951
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,380
working extremely well which allow you

952
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,079
to you know get going with your work

953
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,680
versus having to worry about all the tax

954
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,560
that you have to pay to get um you know

955
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,020
to be able to protect it so it's a

956
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,700
really great question it's Case by case

957
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
and

958
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,020
um there is value in

959
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,160
um there are at least four or five

960
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,920
different models you know pure sock in

961
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,140
your organization just the network part

962
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,900
is outsourced or a combination of the

963
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,740
two so so that's you know that is

964
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,960
something to worth investigating and

965
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,000
seeing between the compliance and

966
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,460
security needs what model will suit you

967
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,640
Sony would you like to add uh yeah the

968
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,440
what I'll add there and you covered it

969
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,260
what I'll add is

970
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,220
that the

971
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,800
what what are you trying to protect so

972
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,599
the size of the company or the

973
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,440
organization really does not it's not a

974
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,320
one-to-one you know match it's the the

975
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,839
question the answer would be what are

976
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,820
you trying to protect and and what is

977
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,460
your so for example you take a

978
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,040
you know Mom and Pop company that is you

979
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,280
know has 10 employees 20 employees uh

980
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,260
again the type of business that they're

981
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,680
in versus you know an I.T business that

982
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,859
or a bank for example uh you know in

983
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,800
terms of uh you know the importance of

984
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
standing a sock would you know kind of

985
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,060
relate to you know what you're trying to

986
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,740
do what are you trying to accomplish and

987
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,599
what where are you in that vulnerability

988
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,680
space or Spectrum uh if you're critical

989
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,900
and you're in the eyes of the entire

990
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,599
world perhaps yes it makes sense to

991
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,820
quickly uh stand up something but like

992
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,880
like Appalachia said it'd be helpful to

993
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,859
either consider all of the the options

994
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,140
that are available today sarcasm service

995
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,420
and the reason you want to consider

996
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,460
Outsourcing that is either from a cost

997
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,980
perspective but also a compliance

998
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,800
perspective uh you know that again

999
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,900
depends on you know what you you know

1000
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,760
the regulation that you're trying to

1001
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,460
make sure that you're in compliance uh

1002
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,460
too the the other aspect is making sure

1003
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,220
that it is a conversation that must be

1004
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,900
had this is the this is where a lot of

1005
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,940
the companies miss out on it they think

1006
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,619
security is not it's not my problem

1007
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,140
today because I don't see it physically

1008
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,380
but cyber security it's not physical and

1009
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,180
so that makes it very difficult for most

1010
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,339
people to recognize it up front but

1011
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,020
every environment every business

1012
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,359
organization should think about this and

1013
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:45,660
consider it and take action

1014
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,660
back to you abalasha before you take

1015
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,359
that next question who is all is also

1016
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,520
coming from one of our PhD candidates in

1017
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,040
The Serious Program uh sunny and you're

1018
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,660
dealing with the the customers and

1019
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,060
things uh much of your presentation was

1020
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,160
talked about sustainability and and I

1021
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,839
had an anecdotal conversation with

1022
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,920
somebody help

1023
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,740
how how much are the are companies

1024
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,720
coming to you and saying that uh

1025
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,579
sustainability and green technologies

1026
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:14,640
and and lowering the energy bill and and

1027
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,160
saving the uh the uh saving the world

1028
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,800
and all that is part of their concern

1029
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,260
and then the second part is that is

1030
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,180
because the anecdotal store that I'd

1031
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,940
heard is that they start to fold when

1032
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,339
they come to well it's going to cost us

1033
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:30,780
more well let's just go ahead and

1034
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,760
continue to be an energy hog are you are

1035
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,800
you what it what is it on the front

1036
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,599
lines of dealing with the customers that

1037
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,060
you're hearing

1038
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,740
you're absolutely correct uh the issue

1039
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,680
there is most people think about it talk

1040
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,260
about it but don't take action which is

1041
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,800
why we wanted to uh amplify our voice

1042
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,359
here to say

1043
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,220
everybody and I'm sure we don't know who

1044
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,960
is going to listen to this but to

1045
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,599
amplify the voice that is a need to

1046
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,640
Galvanize thought leaders to begin to

1047
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,440
make this into our day-to-day business

1048
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,500
operation and if we don't we'll be

1049
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,839
surprised when we get to that future

1050
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,680
and the second aspect of it is

1051
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,440
people are thinking of ways of getting

1052
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,480
around it and I'm sure you've heard of

1053
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,660
the term greenwashing where they look at

1054
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,940
how can I align with somebody who is

1055
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,640
doing something close to something that

1056
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,220
relates to sustainability and once I do

1057
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,380
that I can take the claim that you make

1058
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,680
the claim that yes I too have done it

1059
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,319
but that's what we need to get people

1060
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,480
begin to drum this up within the next

1061
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,160
five years to get thought leaders

1062
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,260
together to say look how can we bake

1063
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,900
this into our way of life it's not just

1064
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,940
a one-time thing but it becomes our way

1065
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,300
of life

1066
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,460
thank you

1067
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,280
I just love how Sony explained that also

1068
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,079
by the way because

1069
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,040
it's not in it's really not uh bad to be

1070
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,319
I just can't imagine being on the

1071
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,060
sidelines for something that important

1072
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,760
you know so while we observe it and we

1073
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,319
talk about it and then get going with

1074
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,900
our day-to-day the idea of embracing it

1075
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,760
and really making the difference if it's

1076
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,680
not us then who

1077
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,260
um just taking action is so critical

1078
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,240
otherwise it doesn't happen on its own

1079
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,960
and there is an additional question in

1080
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,020
the Q a and it is very specifically for

1081
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,780
you abolisha yeah and sunny feel free to

1082
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,119
share your kids experiences too I'm a

1083
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,579
little older but I can't tell you when I

1084
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,400
saw drew the question is um what is the

1085
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,460
best part of Purdue serious experience

1086
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,680
um and uh what might you have done

1087
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,480
differently I just stopped at Purdue

1088
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,780
experience and I was like gosh um you

1089
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,240
have no idea how much I'm attached to it

1090
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,780
um it's been many years time passes most

1091
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,180
older people will say that and it really

1092
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,480
does pass very fast but I realized every

1093
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,880
second of being at Purdue

1094
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,660
um I um education wise the friends

1095
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,359
friends turned family I met my husband

1096
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,940
there too my sister was there like and

1097
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,480
seriously the friends who the circle

1098
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,940
that we made over the years they are now

1099
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,859
different leaders in different parts of

1100
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,660
the industry we wear different hats but

1101
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,040
we're so closely knit

1102
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,579
the relation with professors with our

1103
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,940
staff with everyone is

1104
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,339
Beyond a certain role it's not just

1105
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:35,940
about getting some one thing done I lean

1106
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,339
on them as I would lean on you know

1107
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,380
um Family literally like if something

1108
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,020
goes on I'll just send a message and

1109
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,540
it's like hey I need to talk

1110
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,280
um so we built some long-standing

1111
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,859
relationships and I really

1112
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,319
um that Purdue experience was very very

1113
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,859
positive one uh for me it was an a safe

1114
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,020
environment to continue to learn learn

1115
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,119
like anything like Joel was talking

1116
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,220
about four majors you could stay there

1117
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,780
forever in front of that Fountain

1118
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,640
writing that thesis

1119
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,920
um it's like okay ready for the next one

1120
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,540
but at some point you want to do

1121
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,220
something about it you see things and

1122
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,079
you want to go and make a difference in

1123
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,140
the world and the relationships have

1124
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,540
helped quite a bit so learning making

1125
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,119
friends and building those relationships

1126
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,800
was very natural and it was a really

1127
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,140
good part the other thing which I really

1128
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,960
would love for folks to have is

1129
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,599
um I think the education made me

1130
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,079
Fearless like many people challenged uh

1131
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,000
over many years like can you do this and

1132
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,420
I still remember I was half in tears I

1133
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,640
think once I went into number Theory

1134
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,200
class was really tough so I walked into

1135
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,319
Professor wagstaff's office he was

1136
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,119
having and his wife came over and there

1137
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,099
was some really good cookies so that

1138
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,980
made it better and we sat down that

1139
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,960
afternoon from morning to night and we

1140
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,400
went through the entire number Theory

1141
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,900
Book and it's like it's not that hard

1142
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,180
you know and he just broke it down into

1143
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,400
smaller pieces it's like we can do

1144
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,619
anything I mean nothing is tough if you

1145
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,440
just sit down and in the smartest Minds

1146
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,780
in the world you just work together and

1147
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,839
get things done with some respect with a

1148
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,940
really nice positive environment so

1149
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,940
every bit of it was good things I would

1150
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,440
have done differently it's hard to think

1151
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,119
about it but I'm sure there were things

1152
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,619
I could have done differently I was a

1153
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,339
child myself you know on um being able

1154
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,359
to

1155
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,700
um you know I don't know explore even

1156
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,700
further but I have to tell you uh the

1157
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,740
things that I remember at this point are

1158
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,720
things that I just

1159
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,119
seriously treasure um and I'm very
