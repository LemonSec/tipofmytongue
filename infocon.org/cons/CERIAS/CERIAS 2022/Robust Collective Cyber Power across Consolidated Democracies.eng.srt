1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
so hello everyone so it is our great

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,920
order to help create the metric to our

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,200
seminar

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,800
and

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
her buyer in our homepage is very short

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
but actually her list is really really

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
long i want to tell you something so she

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,119
is active actually i think more than 30

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,240
kind of 35 years right she has

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,199
active action in the

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,080
cyber security policy and strategic

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
development and uh

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
she showed a lot of things about

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
especially cyber war and

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,320
the strategy and the policy about the

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
cyber security and uh i want to actually

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,960
highlight very very important thing for

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
all of us is most of us are from

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
computer science but the cyber security

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
is much much beyond the

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
computer science technical part and her

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
view is very special and unique for us

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,440
to have a big wheel a much much bigger

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
view about her cyber security cyber war

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
and everything so

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
and by the way and the quiz didn't show

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
her record but if you check in

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
30 years ago she is already the mata

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
asking fellow so

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
you're crazy you are amazing actually

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
the scholar and i don't want to

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,759
highlight spend too much time to

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,799
introduce her achievement and we want to

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
warmly welcome the priest to share his

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
opinion about psycho power actually

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
across the

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,200
democracy so

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,079
it's our pleasure to have you yeah

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,720
all right thank you very much uh let's

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
get started

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,079
let me uh

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,960
i only have a 110 slides so this ought

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
to be pretty quick

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,520
um

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
i'm going to make you an argument today

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,719
about

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
why we need robust cyber power amongst

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
consolidated democracies

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,439
and um

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,360
i i hope that i can make this

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
i will make this within 30 minutes

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
that's how it's going to happen

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
what i'm going to argue is that the

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,680
problem a good part of the problem that

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
we have today began

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
with the way we built the internet from

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,680
the beginning

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
and this argument has four parts i'm

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,879
going to argue that it was built badly

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,760
and it was built badly due to naivete to

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
greed and hubris

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
secondly that what we created was a very

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
shoddy substrate and of course it's been

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
fully exploited by adversaries right and

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
creating something that we would call

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
great i call great systems conflict

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
and thirdly that this

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
then has changed the future survival

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
options for the minority community of

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
consolidated democracies uh we're weird

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
anyway we're strange the rest of the

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
world isn't quite like us and it doesn't

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
make us better it just makes us weird

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
and so we

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
need a new narrative

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
the fourth point and that narrative

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
needs to be a collective operational

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
way for us to have democratic cyber

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
power and i'm going to give you an

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
example of what i um what i think we

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
should be doing there

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
so number one poor cyber parenting all

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
right we built this and we built it

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
badly

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
we basically built it in such a way that

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,319
we

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
facilitated offense

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
losses

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
and conflict

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
as it spread across the global system

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
this is what we thought we were building

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
you know peace love and eternal

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,399
prosperity

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
and this is what we got

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,680
right conflict theory we did not get the

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
global village these are language these

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
are words we used at the time in the 90s

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
a global village we didn't get any

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
universal prosperity we didn't get an

100
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,560
open free safe democratizing internet we

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
assume that if anyone connected to the

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
internet they would

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
automatically democratize

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
so of course never happened right

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
and furthermore this substrate the way

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
we created it

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,199
actually creates conflict

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
sloppy code

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
is everywhere

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
why well in part because in the early

111
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
developers in the 1990s they chose

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
fault-tolerant languages because they

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
were quick they keep

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,720
you put what we called software

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
factories together

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,680
and they were protected from

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
responsibility by our own naivete we

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
said these things if a government or

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
anyone regulates the internet or any of

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
the people that work on it then it will

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,280
die

122
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,880
we believed this too so ignorance hubris

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,440
and missing laws allowed them

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
to use his fault tolerant languages and

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
basically make it possible to hack and

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
what did they give the hackers

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
five offense advantages that had never

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
been seen in history except

129
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
for

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
emperors

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,039
or close neighbors

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
if you're an emperor

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
or a close neighbor

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
then you can figure out your number you

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
have the money you can have any scale of

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
organization you can be any distance

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
from an adversary or a target you can

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
buy all the weapons that you can get

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
your hands on

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
you don't need to hide what you use and

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
you don't need to hide who you are

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
with this shoddy substrate

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
anyone with access to the internet and

144
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
some time and a little skill maybe not

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
too much

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
can have any scale of organization they

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
like using a botnet

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
they can be five to five thousand

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
kilometers away from a target and get

150
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,919
what used to be considered high quality

151
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,360
intelligence about them

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
they can pick a wide variety of weapons

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
with a certain amount of precision to do

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
this or do that

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
they can hide those tools when they use

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,440
them and they can hide themself when

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,840
they do it this changes the nature of

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
conflict right and what is the

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,919
consequence for us in democracies and

160
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
consolidated democracies

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
cyber insecurity loss is estimated to be

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,080
one to two percent of the gdp it is not

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,160
sustainable and this by the way is

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
before code

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,840
it also accelerated it didn't make the

166
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,880
movement but it accelerated the movement

167
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
of the global center of economic power

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
away from the democracies to asia and

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
specifically to china

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
right

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
and it created this natural tension

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
this cybered conflict

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,280
worldwide

174
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
now these conflicts

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
ride on this shoddy construction but

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,639
they have a ripple effect through the

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
society and here's a model of what this

178
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
does so here are your five offense

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
advantages

180
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
and they ripple through the sources of

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
systemic surprise every society has them

182
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
every society is a socio-technical

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
economic system but particularly now

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,520
because it's been integrated using the

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,639
shoddy substrate every society has

186
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
single enterprises that are complex and

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
they have surprises they have to deal

188
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
with

189
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,280
every society now has joined large

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,560
enterprises that means they work across

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
their particular domain or industry and

192
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
they're integrated

193
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,520
but now we have another layer another

194
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
source of systemic surprise and that is

195
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,319
the world's mass that tsunami of bad

196
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,919
actors

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
able to use these five offense

198
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
advantages against anyone they in any

199
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
society they can reach into

200
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,639
and of them

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
we also have

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,800
five ten percent the top of the

203
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,759
very smart ones they're scary smart

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
call them the wicked actors

205
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,879
comes

206
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
from the mathematical notion wicked

207
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
problems right other people call them

208
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,319
wizards

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
these people don't work for themselves

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,639
they always work for a transnational

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,280
criminalization or a state

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
and the consequences of having now two

213
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
more sources of systemic surprise is

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
that states tend to have weak systemic

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
resilience when they're digitized

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
and weak forward defense

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,399
consequences they are weak cyber powers

218
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,958
cyber power rests on not just whether or

219
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
not you can throw it out

220
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,880
but can you take it defend against it

221
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,399
and this leaves governments with trying

222
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,240
to figure out what to do

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,839
when they have to figure out what to do

224
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,760
they have to reach back into cyberspace

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
somewhere

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
and as dan cool has pointed out there

227
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
are three things in reaching you touch

228
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
the

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,399
con like activity

230
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,839
you touch the content we touch the

231
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,519
cognition now for democracies they don't

232
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,080
want to touch the congregation

233
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
that's what you think

234
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
they don't want to touch the content

235
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,720
that's free speech

236
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
so they're left with connectivity and

237
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
that is mostly owned by the private

238
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,279
sector

239
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,360
and so what we have is the democracies

240
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
at the moment

241
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
have this

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
vicious cycle going on

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
where they end up with one to two

244
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
percent of their gdp and losses as a

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
function of this

246
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
now

247
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,640
to the second point

248
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,880
adversaries of democracies are going

249
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
to use this this should not come as

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
anyone's surprise

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
nowhere along the way should it come as

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
anyone's surprise

253
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
but helping them along is the fact that

254
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
the vast majority of people who use the

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,160
substrate have no idea how it's built

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
they don't understand that it's entirely

257
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
peer or pay that every piece of traffic

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,839
only moves along the internet because a

259
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
recipient server somewhere either has a

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
contract by which you pay them to take

261
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
your traffic or they've agreed as a peer

262
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
that they'll just pass it along right

263
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
95 of it travels on undersea cables as

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,519
well and so let's look at it for a quick

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,160
minute this is you me we're internet

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
users this is all we tend to pay

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,600
attention to goes out to some server

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
and we sign up we put a little modem in

269
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
you understand that that's called the

270
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
third tier

271
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
and that then goes into servers that are

272
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,560
in server exchanges

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,600
and every server in there

274
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,519
has a contract or appearing relationship

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,920
it's not there by accident and that's

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
the tier two sometimes called the ip

277
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
backbone

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
and these servers are called points of

279
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
presence i'm going to make a point about

280
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
this so i'm i'm highlighting them to you

281
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
and as the traffic goes up it then hits

282
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
the tier 1 networks that's your verizons

283
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
they're massive

284
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
and they deal with each other as peers

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
it's too big to charge money so they

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
just agree they're going to travel

287
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,680
they're going to they're going to move

288
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
the traffic along and what that means is

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
that it makes it worth your while to

290
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,240
move the traffic up to the tier one and

291
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
then down that's a cheaper path if

292
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
someone is not doing that

293
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,240
they've chosen a more expensive path

294
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
and this

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
all

296
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
is run by what we call the border

297
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
gateway protocol routing table and many

298
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
of you are in computer science and you

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
probably know all about this

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,079
what i'm going to talk about is if you

301
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
as a government or you as a people don't

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
understand how the internet is

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
constructed then someone can exploit

304
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
that and they can exploit your bgp

305
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
against you so let me show you a quick

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
piece of research i did with dr yuval

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
shavit

308
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
we published this in 2018. this is

309
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
called bgp hijacking

310
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
and we noticed something odd about the

311
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
points of prisons that were being run by

312
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,920
china telecom in north america there's

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
10 of them at the time in north america

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
and this is what we noticed so we

315
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
noticed traffic particularly vile notice

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
traffic

317
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
traffic that supposed to come from one

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
place in this case scandinavia to japan

319
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
is a nice clean straight path

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
when that traffic would hit the china

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
telecom

322
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,079
pop

323
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
here in scandinavia it would travel from

324
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
china telecom pop to pop to pop would go

325
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
through china one around in china and

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
then come to japan this wasn't a

327
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
misconfiguration this went on for some

328
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,560
time

329
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
now in this case it was a news network

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
we noticed another one uh this was a

331
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,320
government-to-government communication

332
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
and it started in japan should have gone

333
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
to singapore and then uae no particular

334
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
problem here

335
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
what happened is it hit the china

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,519
telecom pop

337
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
it went to another china teleport

338
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
in california

339
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
it then went into china

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,279
and then went to uae

341
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,600
and this was a pattern it wasn't a

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
misconfiguration

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
someone

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
was hijacking the traffic for whatever

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
so this is what it should have done this

346
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
was a large bank

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,000
travel

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,959
italy from houston and instead it hit

349
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,040
the china telecom pop in the united

350
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
states went to the next china telecom

351
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,519
pub and went to china and never made it

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,959
now that was the stuff we published in

353
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
2018

354
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
i asked you all we were starting

355
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
outside of the united states does it

356
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
also happen there

357
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
he started finding of course he found

358
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
that for example in africa

359
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
what we have is an arrangement between

360
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
china telecom

361
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
and their

362
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,720
russian partner trans telecom

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
and traffic that has no reason to travel

364
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
through moscow will hit the china

365
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,839
telecom pops go to the china telecom pop

366
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,480
in moscow then go to the china telecom

367
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
pop in germany and finally end up where

368
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,399
it was intended to go it's another

369
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
example of this starts in israel it's

370
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
meant for milan should have gone over

371
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
here and hit to milan instead it gets

372
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,240
diverted through these pops through

373
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
moscow

374
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
this doesn't happen just once it's not a

375
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
misconfiguration this is our people

376
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
using the fact that the defenders don't

377
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
unders and

378
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
this system

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
that they're defending

380
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,839
now

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
today

382
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
yeah

383
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,959
um

384
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
we're losing a little bit of your audio

385
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
let's try turning your camera off and

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
maybe that'll send some bandwidth to the

387
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
to the audio side until you're through

388
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,360
your slides please

389
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,079
all done okay

390
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
so today we have to recognize

391
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
that this is a place

392
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
of competition moving to conflict

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,120
because of the losses

394
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
but china is a major player

395
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
and china's rise is china's rise is

396
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
built on a strategically coherent

397
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
view of the world

398
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
china is focused on dominating what i

399
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
call cyber's offspring machine

400
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,399
quantum it graduates more computer

401
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,399
scientists for years than the us does in

402
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,920
all of stem

403
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,639
it has a has a reverse stream of highly

404
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
skilled western educated cyber experts

405
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
they're offered huge labs who would say

406
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,399
no

407
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,000
and of course it's laying ownership

408
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,759
lines and indirect control lines all

409
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,759
over the developing world makes it much

410
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
easier to engage in these kinds of

411
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
behaviors and to use these five

412
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
offensive advantages

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
and xi jinping's been quite clear

414
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
weird he's rejecting western civil

415
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
society values

416
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
and views this as a return to beautiful

417
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,440
place due to demographic scale

418
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,240
at the apex of cyber power as well and

419
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
all the other powers

420
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
the thing we have to remember in the

421
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
west

422
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,920
is

423
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
this actually resonates with a good part

424
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
of the world

425
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,399
that

426
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
we are the weird ones they are not

427
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
and therefore

428
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
this is a problem

429
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,199
our own survival over time

430
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,040
and why are we surprised why does anyone

431
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
be surprised

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
in fact throughout history china has

433
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,480
been the major gdp

434
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
so it shouldn't come as any great

435
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
surprise it's not demonizing china it's

436
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,680
recognizing a reality that others should

437
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
have recognized for some time

438
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,320
but what has surprised us and it's what

439
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
made us different

440
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,959
to figure out what to do is how fast it

441
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,160
happened

442
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,000
the chinese themselves

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
anticipated that they would reach the

444
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,079
same gdp as the us and 2049.

445
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,360
in fact by the measures of of ppp for

446
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
gdp which is purchasing parity

447
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,959
they did it already in 2014

448
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
and they were 20 ahead of the us by 2019

449
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,839
and this was before coded before the

450
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,160
pandemic okay

451
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
and furthermore as they spread out they

452
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,599
take with them their preferences

453
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,640
and they will have the ability to change

454
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
internet protocol over time why

455
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
sheer scale they will simply be there

456
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,439
that's

457
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,439
what you you face if that's okay

458
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,319
you

459
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
like

460
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
the way

461
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
that those preferences get executed then

462
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
this different

463
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
when china is the central business node

464
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
chinese preferences will be built into

465
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,840
the technologies they set out

466
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
and this is already happening for

467
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
example i draw your attention to the

468
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,840
smart city initiatives

469
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
these are facial surveillance systems

470
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
that are being sold to local governments

471
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,720
not only do the chinese who run them get

472
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
the data but of course so do the local

473
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,080
government

474
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
and they're being used against dissent

475
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
or even political opposition already so

476
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,280
these things are worth paying attention

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
to

478
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,039
baidu

479
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
is of course their equivalent of on the

480
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720
gps

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
and it is circulating around the world

482
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
particularly located above capitals of

483
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
every country for whatever reasons and

484
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
although china telecom is having

485
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,679
difficulty in the united states and

486
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,559
north america with its 10 pops

487
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
across 23 countries

488
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
they are they have over 2 500 pups

489
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
around the world so the kinds of things

490
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
that we can see now

491
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
can go on at any time right

492
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
there are no western pops in china by

493
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
the way

494
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
that means number three the future is

495
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,679
coming fast and it really isn't in the

496
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,679
favor of the minority community of

497
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
consolidated democracies in this digital

498
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,280
because of the way we built the internet

499
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,400
because of its offense advantages

500
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
we've stepped into

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
a conflict that is throughout our

502
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,440
systems it's it's what i call a great

503
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
systems conflict

504
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
china has the opportunity and will it is

505
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
the largest digital economy that is

506
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
inevitable

507
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
it will alter the global international

508
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,679
economic system

509
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
in 2006 only one chinese firm seven

510
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
large telecommunications firm huawei and

511
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
it has a checkered past and got there

512
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
but not

513
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
less there it is

514
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,320
and by 2014 for the seven are chinese

515
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,400
by 2020 huawei is already the largest

516
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,480
telecommunications vendor in the entire

517
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,160
world and the chinese firms are

518
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
distributed throughout the world they

519
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
actually operate differently in africa

520
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
than they do in the middle east and asia

521
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
in one particular way in africa they're

522
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,400
very

523
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,799
uh very likely to offer

524
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,600
to

525
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
install a system maintain a system

526
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
upgrade it and

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,000
and

528
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,679
innovate with it

529
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,520
practically for free

530
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
whereas in the middle east and in asia

531
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,080
they um charge it as a loan

532
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
very strategic

533
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
in 2020 the chinese government began to

534
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
say

535
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
we want a new internet infrastructure

536
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
and it's been working

537
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
through the u.n through the itu

538
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,960
which is strongly supported as the

539
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,559
cyberspace standards making body in the

540
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,679
world

541
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,280
it isn't

542
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,360
it isn't technically yet it doesn't have

543
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
that kind of control yet but it's

544
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
certainly pushing it

545
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,480
and they want a fundamental internet

546
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
redesign not as the one i'm going to

547
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,360
recommend

548
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
but in this redesign every individual

549
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,240
will have to register every individual

550
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
in the world will have to enter using

551
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
their name

552
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,679
to use the internet and authorities can

553
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,159
shut off that individual's access at any

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,600
time

555
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
this is a fundamental problem with the

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,559
values of the democratic consolidated

557
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,280
democracies that is a fundamental

558
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
problem okay

559
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
and it gets worse at the moment remember

560
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
this picture nice and clear little

561
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,440
layers everything this is the kind of

562
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
work that you know you all and i can do

563
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,360
we can trace these pgp hijacking but

564
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
this is the world that's coming

565
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
it's a world of clouds in their

566
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
commercial clouds still peer or pay

567
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
but what goes on inside a commercial

568
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
crowd they have no obligation to reveal

569
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
to researchers such as myself to the

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,559
government or to anyone else

571
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,240
the commercial clouds when you are in

572
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,120
google land google can can basically

573
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,159
program

574
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
that google and to do whatever google

575
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
wants it and hire anyone at once at any

576
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,720
level of security it would like

577
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,360
and this is opaque to the rest of us so

578
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
it's doubling down on a problem people

579
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,200
don't understand the system

580
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,799
the international

581
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,440
submarine cable network is complexifying

582
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
where does it come where is

583
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
international cyberspace anymore note

584
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
that every

585
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,000
cable comes up on somebody's sovereign

586
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
territory so is international in between

587
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,400
over here when it hits the first server

588
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,640
and what we've seen over the last 25

589
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
years is a growing

590
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
sense of borders and cyberspace my

591
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
cyberspace we're seeing cyber strategies

592
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,679
say this is mine

593
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,080
i will defend

594
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,600
mine

595
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,720
and so we're seeing these little

596
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
if you will cyber kingdoms already shown

597
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
that's extraordinarily difficult right

598
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
and in the old days the stacks were

599
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
relatively non-complex either

600
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,159
but even the stacks are complexifying

601
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,280
here now we have an enormous amount of

602
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,039
connected devices

603
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,480
we have

604
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
cloud computing

605
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
and just to throw it in i have put in

606
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
the ai stack

607
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,960
which is adding machine learning data

608
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
management

609
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
we are dealing with the world that is

610
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
doubling down on that insecure substrate

611
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
on which we built it to begin

612
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
right

613
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,280
so it's going to matter who

614
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
owns upgrades maintains these stacks

615
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
inside the democracies

616
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,559
it's going to matter who does it for the

617
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
entire global socio-technical economic

618
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,799
system right

619
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,559
and the future democracies will depend

620
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,960
on how well china is able to capitalize

621
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
on its scale its strategic coherence

622
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
which is pretty impressive

623
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
in order to dictate

624
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
the governance the resource flows the

625
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
technological advantages

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
and the profit-taking rules

627
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
that will if nothing else happens also

628
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,320
govern

629
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
the choices for consolidated democracies

630
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
so the final point democracies the

631
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,440
consolidated democracies are a minority

632
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,039
community it's never been a whole

633
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,320
boatload of

634
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
right

635
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
we need to find a way amongst ourselves

636
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
to have the scale

637
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,960
and the strategic operational coherence

638
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,520
to ensure an acceptable future for the

639
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
democratic model

640
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
in this digitized world right

641
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,080
so we need a new narrative and this

642
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
narrative has to be collective and it

643
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,559
has to be inclusive

644
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
so the first one is we have to scale up

645
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,559
we have

646
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
by a

647
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,200
conservative account over 900 million

648
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
person market and these are a market

649
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
across

650
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,679
common with common democratic values

651
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
this includes our private sector

652
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
so we need a an integrated whole of

653
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
society defense with our allies with

654
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,240
their private sectors with our

655
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,440
telecommunications our i.t capital goods

656
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
sectors right

657
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
it's going to have to it will definitely

658
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,919
have to be a federalized system

659
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,480
but nonetheless it has to include the

660
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,679
private sector

661
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,279
and we have to buy time this is

662
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,440
happening so fast we have so many people

663
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,919
who still don't understand how it's

664
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,279
constructed

665
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,000
we have to actively defend our critical

666
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
forms of democratic i.t

667
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
with the private sector

668
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
right this is a key to shared resilience

669
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,640
strategies but specifically as crowds

670
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,320
excuse me clouds grow

671
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
it does not mean we don't trade of

672
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,279
course we trade

673
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,919
but it does mean that we defend within

674
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,159
the consolidated democracies

675
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,960
right

676
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,159
and finally

677
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
and importantly we have to transform the

678
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,799
technology

679
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,480
that we have to invest massively like a

680
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
wartime temple

681
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,120
wartime tempo of investment in advanced

682
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,320
technologies like ai advanced i.t for

683
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,640
the long-term defense of our own

684
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
economic and security and well-being we

685
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,320
have to reconstruct the current social

686
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
space within the established democracies

687
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,000
start small work with what we are

688
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,720
and make it what we meant it to be

689
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,919
safe

690
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,760
innovative generative democratic

691
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
internet

692
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
and when we do that with the rest of the

693
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,720
world when it works and say look see

694
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,799
you can work in a digitized world you

695
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,960
can be a prosperous and insecure

696
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
democracy in a digitized world

697
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
and provide a successful counter

698
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
narrative to the china model

699
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
i argue that will actually reduce the

700
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
tension

701
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
because peers deal with peers

702
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,640
differently

703
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,679
if you are a rising power and you see

704
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,080
the other is timing and not gonna be

705
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
appear for long

706
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,120
you're more aggressive

707
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,919
right

708
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
and we have countries like denmark

709
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,880
ten million people having a chance so

710
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,760
peers deal with peers differently

711
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,200
that's what this is part of it that's

712
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
what this is about

713
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,720
that

714
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,600
what i

715
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
call it is

716
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
the cyber operational resilience

717
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
alliance akora

718
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,520
that works

719
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
we start with the governments

720
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
right governments work with their

721
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,840
private sector

722
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
their um

723
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
their

724
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,760
what i would call anchor institutions

725
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,799
they're working with their

726
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,399
telecommunications

727
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,640
on the connectivity we are not trying to

728
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,399
control the content or the cognition

729
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
because we're democracies

730
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
they're also working with our i.t

731
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,399
capital goods industry

732
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
this is the wartime temple

733
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,919
r d

734
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,080
and the focus size

735
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,159
in this

736
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,840
reconstructing the internet is to reduce

737
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,600
the five offense advantages

738
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
consequences rolls through these four

739
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
sources of of um systemic surprise

740
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
now we have the possibility for systemic

741
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,240
resilience and also the ability when

742
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,120
it's legal for forward defense

743
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
and that makes cyber powers

744
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,640
and that makes consolidate collective

745
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,159
cyber powers

746
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
and i call them cora allied nations and

747
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,039
there is a robust cyber power that is

748
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,200
shared across the democracies and then

749
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
can be shared as a model for the right

750
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,880
of the world

751
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
trust me there is no assured future for

752
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,679
democracy

753
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,640
in a deeply cyber authoritarian world

754
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,039
great systems conflict and we do not

755
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,320
hang together i love ben franklin so

756
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
if we do not hang together internally

757
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,240
and across allies

758
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,679
we will most

759
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,880
certainly hang separately

760
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,039
you are i'm happy to answer questions

761
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,200
and fill in holes wherever i can

762
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,049
[Music]

763
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,600
so hello everyone so uh if you want to

764
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,039

765
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,559
so chris

766
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,039
um and the way the student the post a

767
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,520
question in the q a can you say that or

768
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,200
you want me to read the question for you

769
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
i'm turning uh hang on a minute i just

770
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,760
turned it off at the bottom of the room

771
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080
can you say q and a and then

772
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,760
i see it he will say that yeah yes

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,919
do you want to turn on my video again as

774
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,360
i'm answering and i'm not oh yes

775
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,279
please turn on your video we want to say

776
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,600
yeah i think the current network is good

777
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,760
awesome

778
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,320
okay i see

779
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
um

780
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
okay but there aren't questions they're

781
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
just comments so let's go uh where am i

782
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,360
going q a all right

783
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,799
okay

784
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,640
uh cora is a

785
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
concept but it's a concept that i argue

786
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,960
is already being built in pieces

787
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,760
um i am in fact in the process right now

788
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
of creating the database

789
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,320
of the private sector organizations that

790
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,360
would naturally fit into accora

791
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,159
and across the consolidated democracies

792
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,000
we see the rise of things like ncsc's

793
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,279
national cyber security centers

794
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,399
the

795
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,960
one of the ideal types that show is the

796
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
uk's um ncsc

797
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,520
uh another model

798
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
of an ncsc

799
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,799
equivalent

800
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,360
is the um israeli cyber directorate as

801
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
well but

802
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
you see countries realize they need a

803
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,640
whole of society response and that whole

804
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,279
of recit society response interacts

805
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,360
directly with their private sector and

806
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
i'm

807
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
i'm trying to pull all of that together

808
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,080
all those interim pieces together going

809
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
look we don't have to start with a

810
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
tobleroza you know that i mean with

811
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,919
nothing an empty table we've got stuff

812
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,200
already there

813
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,159
so that that's my answer

814
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,039
um

815
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,360
next one

816
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,919
i'm okay so

817
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,679
what do i think the advent of web 3 will

818
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,679
change the landscape so much is going to

819
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,760
change the landscape but i don't see it

820
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,039
at the moment it's changing the

821
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,880
landscape necessarily in the direction

822
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,799
of better security for the entire system

823
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,080
okay

824
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,080
nice

825
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,960
um

826
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,760
wherever oh uh web3 um the difficulty is

827
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,720
people have to be aware that this is a

828
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
problem for example if you read the

829
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,320
literature today on ai

830
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,640
uh artificial intelligence right mlai

831
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
you you know that you're a computer

832
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,000
scientist so um

833
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
it would it sounds like it's unrelated

834
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
to cyberspace it's like oh here is a.i

835
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,279
it isn't lovely it is beautiful it's

836
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,399
going to solve everything for you and

837
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
because i was a baby professor in the

838
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,760
90s reading all this about the internet

839
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,600
i cannot help but see exactly the same

840
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,039
naive optimism hubris going into ai not

841
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,600
because ai can't do many of the things

842
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
eventually that people want it to do

843
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,840
they don't know how to defend it

844
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,600
last january

845
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,919
of 2021

846
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,880
at the enigma conference

847
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
this microsoft engineer gave this

848
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
wonderful talk about defending ai and

849
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,200
what he pointed out is that microsoft

850
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
had done this back of the envelope

851
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
survey of 28 ml

852
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
firms

853
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,279
and of the 28 ml firms 25 of them had no

854
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,799
idea

855
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,640
how to defend

856
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,679
their ml algorithms they had no idea

857
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
they didn't even think about it it

858
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
wasn't a thought i've had another

859
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
conversation

860
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,600
with a colleague who works at darpa and

861
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,720
this is a you know program manager for

862
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
some ai programs

863
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,679
smart person very thoughtful very

864
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,720
involved absolutely on top of game the

865
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
word security doesn't occur to her

866
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,640
it doesn't it it's not there yet

867
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
so we've got answers

868
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
not applied to fundamental problems and

869
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,679
the fundamental problems are what's

870
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,600
leading to the conflict the heightened

871
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,240
tensions and everything else

872
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,840
i hope that answers that's a question

873
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
how has the core concept been received

874
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,360
by the national defense community

875
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,600
uh well you know

876
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
fire once fire twice keep firing and

877
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,760
then they finally respond what is

878
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,640
happening is people are interested

879
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,360
in having a collective response

880
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,519
what we are seeing this is why i'm

881
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,840
taking the time to find the the private

882
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,320
sectors i've published once on this as a

883
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,280
concept

884
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
um but now i want to

885
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,719
i'm finishing a manuscript that has

886
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
the data to say look you don't have to

887
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,719
start all over

888
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,440
the defense community in general is in

889
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,639
favor of alliances they see them as a

890
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,918
way to save burden to be better prepared

891
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,119
and buffered

892
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,918
um

893
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,839
the kind of would you hear about

894
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,480
collective defense though is of the word

895
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
alliance not operational alliance that's

896
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
my distinction

897
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
and so they're happy to go have meetings

898
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,918
and talk about it and then you know

899
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,440
we'll think

900
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
i don't think there's a rejection of any

901
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,399
of this i just think it's it's

902
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,239
desperately incomplete

903
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,599
that if you're not going to build the

904
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
institutions in order

905
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,119
to actually do something

906
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,320
now we are not going to be advancing the

907
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
the problem or solving the problem in

908
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,359
the future

909
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,720
i hope that answered the question

910
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,720
oh i scared him

911
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,250
ah election integrity

912
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,400
[Music]

913
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,839
uh it says what are my thoughts on

914
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,000
election integrity hardware software

915
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,760
voter trafficking not being investigated

916
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,480
taking seriousness

917
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
well um

918
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
my good colleague david mussington says

919
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
uh would probably beg to differ on the

920
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,640
whether it was taken seriously i guess

921
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
that would question would be who didn't

922
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
take it seriously

923
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,960
um

924
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
it was certainly clear that general

925
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,200
nakasoni took it quite seriously during

926
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
the 2020 election there was an enormous

927
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,960
amount of stuff that went on behind the

928
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
scenes now

929
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,800
in general however

930
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
the u.s has a major problem

931
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
that comes from the fact

932
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,720
um as an old professor of mine it

933
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,200
was a sociology professor once you said

934
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,079
i guess that prince rest in peace said

935
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,440
you know there's

936
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,720
no problem

937
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,400
the united states has that isn't

938
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
directly related somehow to the fact we

939
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,880
got 50 states so we have 50 little

940
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,640
sovereignties and the 50 little

941
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
sovereignties were instructed by their

942
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,359
own state constitutions and our

943
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,200
constitutions to have olds

944
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,640
have an option

945
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
and that means they can set them up they

946
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
like

947
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
and so part of the difficulty on vote

948
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,040
election integrity is unlike most

949
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,839
consolidated democracies

950
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,680
don't have a

951
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,079
federal or a central government control

952
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,119
over

953
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
the quality of those elections and that

954
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
become a problem of election integrity i

955
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,000
am neither for nor against electronic

956
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,119
voting

957
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,560
i am profoundly suspicious of

958
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
electronic voting machines that are

959
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,599
provided by

960
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,920
monopolistically by one

961
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,200
or one other firm that then simply

962
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
claims prior you know propriety

963
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,359
interests proprietary interests and

964
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,960
therefore you can't open up and see what

965
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,079
it's doing

966
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,839
and then of course there's the problem

967
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,920
of the 50 states

968
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,160
and they've never had this digital

969
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,640
threat to voter registration lists for

970
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,200
example who cares who would ever attack

971
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
that

972
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,680
if i

973
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
had just a little bit of bitcoin for

974
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
every time someone has told me over the

975
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
last 25 years who would want to attack

976
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
that

977
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
i would be buying you all dinner i would

978
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
be very wealthy it's astounding

979
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
how often

980
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,160
the lack of attention to this problem

981
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,599
comes from

982
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,480
um

983
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
sheer ignorance

984
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
their ignorance they just they can't

985
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,400
imagine it

986
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
and then when it happens they get

987
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
they're horrified shocked whatever but

988
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,599
they can't

989
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,920
imagine this is why we have to rebuild

990
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,720
it

991
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,480
we can't just we can't expect the

992
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
individual or random individual to spend

993
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
their time going well i wonder if that's

994
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,079
a compromise of my server that one you

995
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,200
know that

996
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
no we have to rebuild it uh i i will

997
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,800
quote a german um

998
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,359
a german security official and told me

999
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,839
about 10 years ago he he just chugged

1000
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,960
his

1001
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
hand

1002
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,599
the user is useless you haven't

1003
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,640
go around them

1004
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,000
uh

1005
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,520
yeah

1006
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,240
chris and i also have one question i

1007
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,280
realize as a panelist i i cannot type a

1008
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
question so can i ask one question oh

1009
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,880
please yeah so we know actually

1010
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
we know internet

1011
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,280
is one internet because for the whole

1012
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
global we want to have one internet

1013
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,640
right by the inner slides you also

1014
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,440
mention

1015
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
actually right now this kind of one

1016
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
global internet

1017
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,640
kind of disappear

1018
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
is because in the physical world every

1019
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,359
nation will have their bound and healthy

1020
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,640
politics

1021
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,839
we know

1022
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,560
unfortunately this is kind of true so we

1023
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,119
definitely can say the politics the

1024
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,720
policy

1025
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,200
impact on the internet or when they

1026
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,040
impact our cyber world

1027
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
we know it's hard

1028
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
has to change in a short period but i

1029
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,520
still want to comment a little bit about

1030
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,119
what will be the trend and for future

1031
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,280
and especially from the technical side

1032
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
or police side

1033
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,839
what we can do for our open internet or

1034
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,680
for whatever or how we deal with this

1035
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,400
kind of situation which will happen in

1036
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
the coming years

1037
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
yeah

1038
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,440
so um one of the discussions that's come

1039
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,000
up is you know how many internets will

1040
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,119
we have uh in the future

1041
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,920
um and you know

1042
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,599
some some people say oh we'll have two

1043
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,200
no we'll have three

1044
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,520
um you know i don't like

1045
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,440
so

1046
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
as long as countries are feeling

1047
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,839
threatened

1048
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,800
and they are then told if you filter

1049
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,119
this you hold this you you know you

1050
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,280
control that

1051
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
they're going to put in policies sense

1052
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
that they can technologies

1053
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,200
to either filter

1054
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
or control

1055
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,359
or tamp down we know already smaller

1056
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,040
countries that have decided that they're

1057
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,480
having dissent in their country and they

1058
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,920
shut down the internet they just they go

1059
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
why because they have several major

1060
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,920
servers and exchanges and you know they

1061
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,680
don't they don't literally unplug it but

1062
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
they go

1063
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,040
and they they will shut it down so that

1064
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,079
people can't use it

1065
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,319
i met by countries

1066
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,240
exercising sovereignty so that the

1067
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,200
internet as we know it it never really

1068
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,839
quite existed like we thought it did

1069
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,040
but

1070
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,520
uh the hubris of the westernized nations

1071
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,440
was because it was free for us then it

1072
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
was free for everyone and that made it a

1073
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
global internet

1074
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,880
um

1075
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,359
it's not going to stay it's not going to

1076
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,560
be united it will transmit even in the

1077
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,359
height of war people were during world

1078
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,160
war ii they were sending messages over

1079
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,560
telegraphs that were buried telegraph

1080
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
cables that were buried under the sea so

1081
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,880
communications will go on

1082
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,280
in one way or the other the question is

1083
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,560
at what point are those fillers put in

1084
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,119
and who's who's able to do that who's

1085
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,280
this who's made a policy and has the

1086
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
technical capability to do it

1087
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,880
now there are those who argue

1088
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,640
that if we just encrypted everything

1089
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,160
then we could share anything and uh

1090
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,400
nobody could filter no one could stop

1091
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,359
anything and it would you know do

1092
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,440
we need to do

1093
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,839
but the difficulty with that is

1094
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,119
encryption itself leaving leaving aside

1095
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,280
that how often how that's ever going to

1096
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,480
happen but is the encryption itself

1097
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,359
one of my bedside tables is a

1098
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,040
book called the coming

1099
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,839
encryption apocalypse and of course it's

1100
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,680
about how quantum is going to make what

1101
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,839
we have as encryption today

1102
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,359
very difficult

1103
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,319
and so or break it open

1104
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,839
so i look at this and my response is i'm

1105
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,760
arguing that

1106
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
for the democracies because that's a

1107
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
value we have

1108
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,520
for us we have to figure out how to have

1109
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,319
a secure and open internet and then we

1110
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,520
have to figure out how we

1111
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
how we

1112
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,680
we help others with that model

1113
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,400
the chinese model is country by country

1114
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
my internet your internet and then we

1115
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,920
communicate

1116
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,960
so many countries will pick that model

1117
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,839
because

1118
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
at least till recently for example for

1119
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,280
africans it came practically free

1120
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,720
and they're going to pick it because if

1121
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
you want to control your population

1122
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,200
that's a good way to do it right

1123
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
will they then say oh i want an open

1124
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,040
free internet say across the continent

1125
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
of africa

1126
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,640
um

1127
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,160
maybe

1128
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,800
and then anyway what will happen is at

1129
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,040
some point there will always be some

1130
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,839
level of traffic that just travels

1131
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,240
oh yeah

1132
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
i don't

1133
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,200
that them very much i just say list us

1134
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,920
for that's our value system then we need

1135
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,440
to find the technical way to make that

1136
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,560
happen and also and securely

1137
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,640
yeah for other countries and that's the

1138
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,880
other eighty percent of the world

1139
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,400
those decisions are going to have to be

1140
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,079
made as they

1141
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,760
go forward

1142
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,880
um

1143
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,760
let's see the next question

1144
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,920
happening

1145
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,240
we have more questions okay

1146
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,480
yeah we have one all right let me finish

1147
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,079
with one other

1148
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,920
let me start with your story though

1149
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
about that um

1150
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,400
so

1151
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,599
uh

1152
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,000
let this was about two thousand

1153
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,800
eight or nine and i'm at a conference

1154
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,720
and there's a representative of one of

1155
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,119
our major telecommunications corporation

1156
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,640
standing there with his drink in his

1157
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,319
hand and he's kind of rocking back on

1158
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,760
his heels

1159
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
and he's saying to these three

1160
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
government people who were standing

1161
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,640
there who

1162
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,920
had no idea what the internet looked

1163
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,000
like he's saying well we at

1164
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,880
mega corporation x

1165
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,319
we don't care about national boundaries

1166
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,960
we're a we're a tran we're a global

1167
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,599
corporation we kind of do what we want i

1168
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,160
couldn't stand it

1169
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,119
so i

1170
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,599
go into the conversation and i say well

1171
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,160
you know actually that's just not true

1172
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,839
because you

1173
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,599
mega corporation

1174
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,040
germany has uh employee laws tax laws

1175
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,760
health laws and all that and when you

1176
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,480
make a corporation you put your whatever

1177
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,720
your outlet is in germany you have to

1178
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,480
abide by health laws tax laws employee

1179
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,720
laws and all that and when

1180
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,040
germany makes cyber laws you'll have to

1181
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,200
abide by those two

1182
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,960
and he was like

1183
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
oh

1184
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,400
yeah

1185
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,440
so

1186
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
i really appreciate your answer actually

1187
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,880
this is why i probably say it's more

1188
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,359
complex than the compute science and we

1189
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,440
have two more questions as a q a would

1190
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,280
you want to take a look

1191
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,760
and uh okay

1192
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,800
um

1193
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,680
globally or overarching any trust laws

1194
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,040
that can regulate the influence of big

1195
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,960
tech on the internet

1196
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,720
um

1197
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,319
well

1198
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,160
no but

1199
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
what we have that's having an effect

1200
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,960
that people predicted and other people

1201
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,200
resisted and i see the next question is

1202
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,800
already asked is asking it gdpr

1203
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,599
so

1204
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,720
gdpr is beginning to be

1205
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,640
one of those

1206
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,000
uh

1207
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,800
little standards i meet gdpr rules right

1208
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,440
because they made it hurt if you don't

1209
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
if you don't want to do any business in

1210
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
europe in the eu

1211
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,599
who cares but if you do

1212
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,599
then you have to make a whole special

1213
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,520
arrangement for gdpr or you risk and i

1214
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,920
believe it is what four percent of your

1215
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
global revenue as a fine

1216
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,920
so that hurts that's where even facebook

1217
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
actually put a whole bunch of money into

1218
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,560
a special pot because it knew it was

1219
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,280
going to violate gdpr it was enough

1220
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,160
money at the time to be

1221
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,960
percent of the global revenue so no we

1222
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,520
don't

1223
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,839
approachings but what we have are these

1224
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,160
standards that are beginning to creep up

1225
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,839
because they're the only ones there and

1226
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,400
they are hosted by

1227
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,760
a large economic actor right

1228
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,040
the eu is a huge economic actor you want

1229
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,880
to sell or something in the eu you've

1230
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,720
got to pay attention to them

1231
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
now will we ever have those

1232
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,440
um you know one of the problems with the

1233
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
decline of the um the western

1234
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,359
liberal westernized system is that the

1235
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,200
u.n

1236
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
had a lot more clout than it does now so

1237
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,520
i don't know where that's going to go so

1238
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,560
i don't know if that's going to be

1239
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
overarching maybe bilateral always you

1240
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,520
know you me you me i don't know

1241
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,680
um the expansion strategy sit with the

1242
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
gdpr

1243
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,359
i think the gdpr is sufficiently

1244
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,160
flexible to accommodate this

1245
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
i believe it is

1246
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,880
um

1247
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,640
i know that the

1248
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,520
lawyers that deal with it um

1249
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,079
will spend a great deal of time

1250
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,839
discussing it

1251
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,640
and

1252
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,280
months will go by as they duke around

1253
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,079
with

1254
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,119
but

1255
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,520
i think that it could it could flexibly

1256
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
handle this yes

1257
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,800
i hope so anyway

1258
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,720
in fact i would like wouldn't mind if we

1259
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,720
had a few of the 2d pr uh

1260
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,520
rules in this country but

1261
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,440
there you are

1262
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,319
it will be a lot of discussion and

1263
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,640
women i can answer this one today

1264
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,680
and um

1265
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
if you know my question i think right

1266
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,480
now it's a perfect timing chris so i

1267
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
think you know thank you so much for

1268
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,040
coming to us and to give this very nice

1269
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,960
talk i think this opens a new wheel for

1270
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,599
a different british fresh view for us to

1271
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,440
look at the proper expression from the

1272
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
policy and

1273
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,440
this is a very important perspective to

1274
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,520
look into our cycle right cyber war

1275
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,400
cyber security and uh we are so happy to

1276
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,319
have you and thank you very much

1277
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,440
yeah

1278
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,079
thank you can i make one last comment

1279
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,720
that is the plea to all the computers

1280
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,960
there all the computer scientists in

1281
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,079
here

1282
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,200
so you're going to go out and you're

1283
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,400
going to get a job you're going to work

1284
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,599
for a corporation and

1285
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,920
my plea to you

1286
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,960
is that

1287
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
keep a job but while you're keeping your

1288
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,000
job

1289
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,160
try to insert the concepts of security

1290
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,880
into whatever you're building

1291
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,359
and you know be open to the ideas that

1292
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,319
you might

1293
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,000
you know can make that a little more

1294
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
secure right there

1295
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,119
um

1296
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,119
you know i because i the corporate

1297
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,960
finance guys don't want to hear it we

1298
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,319
know that but it has to be you

1299
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,079
they won't listen and only the technical

1300
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,480
guys can make it happen so

1301
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,920
just my plea

1302
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,839

1304
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
actually also design students and they

1305
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,280
will need that

1306
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,839
