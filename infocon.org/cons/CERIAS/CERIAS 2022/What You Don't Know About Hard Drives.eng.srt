1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
so actually good afternoon everyone so

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,000
welcome back to actually you know our

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
services seminar every wednesday

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
afternoon and this afternoon you know we

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
are so happy to have at the nd clan to

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,880
give us a great talk and andy has

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
rich experience actually you know in

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,439
company about actually all the security

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,880
he worked a lot of companies like

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,199
semantics checkpoint pgp in the post

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,279
and staff in the silicon valley and now

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
he's working in the black

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
uh back blaster which is a cloud storage

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
company this is actually no surprise for

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,440
us he's going to talk about actually

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
storage security and astrology issues

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
and we are going to know a lot of

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
secrets about the hard drives because

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
they are actually launching a lot of

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
data in the i'm

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
i'm sorry and i i try to keep our

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,640
introduction a little bit shorter

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
because i believe you are going to have

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,920
a lot of exciting things actually in

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
your talk

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
yeah so let's welcome andy yeah

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,719
hi thank you thank you very much let me

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
uh i want to start it with the story

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479
because it was it was funny how you you

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,560
tripped over uh black blaze okay um

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
back blaze is the name of the company

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,920
and we do cloud storage and a lot of

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
other stuff that's great but

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
a lot of folks say black blaze okay it's

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
not a hard thing to do um so much so

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,159
that people were typing it into browsers

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
and stuff and looking for us and things

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,119
and we decided we needed to buy

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
that that url right that website um

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,600
except it was owned by a porn company

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,479
um that did porn and so we had to pay

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,360
them

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
and put a porn site out of business in

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,079
order to get that

45
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,240
blackblaze.com site to come over to us

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
so whatever we need to do to make sure

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,079
that people are finding us

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
all right so today we're going to talk

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
about hard drives and a bunch of other

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,280
things related to them

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
and i'm going to talk first about how

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
you know how uh why we need them

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,040
most people these days you have a laptop

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
or whatever it's got an ssd in it and

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
you don't care about hard drives well

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,878
you really should and we'll talk about

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,840
that

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
we'll talk about the data we collect

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,319
all about hard drives we'll talk about

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
failure rates and all kinds of other

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
things and then we'll start to dig into

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
some of the things you can find out

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
about hard drives at the end and then

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
we'll finish up with something about

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
predicting drive failure can you

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
actually do that um so a little

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
adventure as we go through the day um

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
and we go through there if you have

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
questions please type them in we'll try

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
to get to as many of them as we can at

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
the end if not you know i'll give you my

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
email address you can always send them

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
to me later or we'll pick them up

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
all right so

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
why do we care what do we care about

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
hard drives they're going away right uh

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
no no they're not um this is uh idc does

78
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
this little chart here and you can see

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,599
by 2025 about 2.5 zettabytes worth of

80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
hard drive storage is going to be out

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
there right and it's increasing you can

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
see every year hard drives aren't going

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,480
away certainly ssds are becoming part of

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
the personality uh but they're still

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
here and we're relying on this

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
technology it's over 60 years old now

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
right and you probably don't know

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
anything about it you don't think about

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it because you're looking at your laptop

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
right and or you're looking at your pc

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
or whatever the case may be

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
well all folks like us are storing this

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
okay there's us there's obviously these

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
other little tiny companies called

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
amazon and google and microsoft

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
all have cloud storage as well and

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
there's a many others who do the same

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
similar types of things

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
guess what we store stuff on hard drives

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,720
and that's what i'm going to talk to you

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
about today so you know a little bit

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
more about

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
what what we're using

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,720
now each year each quarter we actually

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,319
publish a little report and i'll show

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,480
you that a copy of that later on all

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
right and but as of the end of 2021

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
this is what we had and what we're

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
paying attention to so we had over 200

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
000 hard drives that we monitor on a

111
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
regular basis uh it's about 2.1 exabytes

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
of storage so you probably got a little

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
bit more than you do at home

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,239
and then the next three things i want to

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,400
get into because this is how we measure

116
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
failure in hard drives something called

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
drive days dry failures which is kind of

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
obvious and then something called an

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,478
annualized failure rate and it's

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,560
important to understand how we do what

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
those values are because then you can

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
get understand why things fail and how

123
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
things fail and how they fail over time

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
and all of that in order to measure that

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
so let's start with the data that we

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,400
collect

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
since 2013 we've been collecting uh what

128
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
we call

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
drive stats data okay and for each hard

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
drive that we have each day

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
we collect one row of data you can see

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,919
that right there and there's five or six

133
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
rows right and so we collect the serial

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,479
number model and so on uh we also

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,600
collect what are called the smart stats

136
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
smart stats are something each

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
manufacturer builds into their drive now

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
they there's 255 pairs of stats

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
they use various different ones to

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,280
record data in some are common like

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
smart stat 1 is a read error rate and so

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,039
on um smart stat 9 is power on hours and

143
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
things of that nature but we've been

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
collecting these for all of our drives

145
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
and the only thing we add to that is

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
that failure column right and if a drive

147
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
fails we put that we put a little one

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
there if it doesn't fail it's got a zero

149
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
it's pretty straightforward so that's

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
the data we collect and again we've been

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,039
collecting it for a long time but a

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
drive day which is the point that i want

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
to make on this one is one line so one

154
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
drive for one day

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
so a single drive that very first one

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,240
listed there the sea gate st 400 4 000

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
so on

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880
that drive for one day okay is counts as

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,000
one drive day that drive for 365 days is

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
365 drive days and it gives us a way to

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
organize data and you'll see why that's

162
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
important later

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,759
now the data like i said we've been

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
collecting it since april of 2013 uh all

165
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,639
drives in operation we actually have a

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
csv file for every uh day uh since then

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
and you can kind of see how much data

168
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
that really is right we're up to about

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
80 gig of raw data uh out there by the

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
way you can actually if you're so

171
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
inclined this data is open source

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
um and you can download it you just come

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
to our website there's the site there

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
the location there you scroll down to

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
the bottom the files are broken up

176
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
either annually or quarterly you can

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
download them they're zipped up you have

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
to unzip them um and you can look at the

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
data and and quite frankly actually many

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
people have

181
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
um and you'll see some examples of that

182
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
a little bit later on so the data's

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
there uh for you to look at if you don't

184
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,680
believe what i'm going to tell you

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
oops let's go to the next one there we

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
go

187
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
now a drive failure right what do we

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
think of failure is and there's two

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
types there's something called a

190
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,440
reactive failure which you're probably

191
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
familiar with the drive stops working

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
it doesn't work it doesn't do what you

193
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
want it to do you're banging on the top

194
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
of it or whatever you really need that

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
thing to spin so you can get some data

196
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
off that's a reactive failure then

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
there's something called the proactive

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
failure which is

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
the idea that we can predict at some

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,520
point that that drive is going to fail

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,639
in the future

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,440
and based on some factors and the smart

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,319
stats in particular okay we can we can

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,080
say that drive needs to come out and if

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
you look to the right there you notice

206
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
in the red there's things called five

207
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
reallocated sector count of 82 and 197

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
pending sector count 276. these are all

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
indicators to us because these values

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
should be zero or very low

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
that something is going on with this

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
drive and it needs to come out of the

213
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
system right you'll see later when we

214
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
talk about predicting failure rates if

215
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
we can get a look at that if we can get

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
that information ahead of time

217
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
we do much better off keeping up what's

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
called durability about drives and all

219
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
kinds of cool stuff like that

220
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,520
all right so so we talked about drive

221
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,759
days we understand what drive failure is

222
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
we put it into a formula um and you can

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,039
see we're just using a cohort here in

224
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
this case of all of the models

225
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
of drives that we have and we have 23 24

226
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
different models of different hard

227
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
drives that we use

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,160
and then we said for the period of 2021

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,599
and we have the formula down at the

230
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
bottom right now notice that formula

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,039
doesn't include drive count

232
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
and and it's an important reason i did

233
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
the math down at the bottom with drive

234
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
count but the reason is is that our

235
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
environment is very fluid there are

236
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
constantly new systems coming on and old

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
systems being taken out in other words

238
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
more drives coming in the beginning of

239
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,040
the year for example

240
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
we didn't have 200 2 000 drives we had

241
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
about 160.

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,880
so we added 40 000 drives over the year

243
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
that weren't there for a year so that's

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
why we count drive days and do the math

245
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
like this and this gives us a failure

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
rate okay so that's really kind of nice

247
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
but what can we do with that i mean what

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
is that and how does that matter to us

249
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
right well it matters to us because we

250
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
can look at it in lots of different ways

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
again we can group the drives different

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
ways we can group them over different

253
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,839
periods

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
and we can do that annualized failure

255
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
rate

256
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
and that's um

257
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,839
and that's really cool so you saw the

258
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,399
annual one there right 1.01 percent

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,720
we've done it we can do it quarterly

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
uh and we can even do it over the

261
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
lifetime of the that group of drives

262
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,519
and that gives us an idea of what's

263
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
happening with that group of drives so

264
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,040
if we want to look at one particular

265
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
drive model and we can say hmm

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
interesting i think that the rate is

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
going up more interesting the rate is

268
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
going down okay and we'll talk about

269
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
that in just a bit when we talk about

270
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,279
something called the bathtub curve right

271
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
so and that we could also do things like

272
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
look at it by manufacturer

273
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,160
right

274
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,959
now this is quarter by quarter

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
so what we did is we said okay in q2 of

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
q1 of 2018 here's the data that happened

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
in that period q2 here's the data that

278
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
happened that period and q3 and so on

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,079
and so forth

280
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
this gives us the ability to see changes

281
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
that are happening not quite in real

282
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,079
time because they don't usually happen

283
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
that quickly but trends that are

284
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,320
happening all right and that's really

285
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,839
important to us

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
so you see the the green line there

287
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
that's the seagate tries right

288
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
and they started to they were doing fine

289
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,399
around one and a half percent which is

290
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
about their traditional number for us

291
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
um and then they started going up and we

292
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
started paying attention to them we said

293
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
what's going on so we started digging in

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
we work with seagate and we found a

295
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
particular drive model that was just not

296
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,360
doing well in our environment

297
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
and our environment is really nice a

298
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,320
data center is a nice place i mean it's

299
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
air conditioned it's there's no dust in

300
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
the place right everybody's really quiet

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
you know the machines kind of make a

302
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
little bit of noise but

303
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
you get plenty of electricity it's

304
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,839
filtered it's you got two or three

305
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
sources of it

306
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
it's really really nice for these drives

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
right so when they start misbehaving as

308
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
a group

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
we really need to start paying attention

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
to that something's going on it just

311
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
didn't fit right in our environment may

312
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,760
be perfectly fine in for example an

313
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
external hard drive for you but not good

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,440
for us

315
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
and so we looked at that we made some

316
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
adjustments and you can see the curve

317
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
comes down and that's great and the

318
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
curve then again wandering around one

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
and a half percent and then starts to go

320
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
up again and we had another little drive

321
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
issue we only had a few of them this

322
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
time we were able to correct that um and

323
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
some of those corrections are things

324
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,839
like tuning firmware

325
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,240
that you can do we can do you probably

326
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
can't do that at home okay so if you

327
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
have an external hard drive and it's got

328
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
a

329
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
hard drive in there and you want to tune

330
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,079
it you probably don't have the ability

331
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,519
to do that you might be able to get some

332
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,279
tools off the internet and do some fun

333
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,880
stuff but um yeah you know that's what's

334
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,519
going on so the other way we can look at

335
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,040
the same data and we'll look at the same

336
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
data again is cumulative in other words

337
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
starting from the beginning of time each

338
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
quarter and just adding on right you

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
know what the difference is and there

340
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
you see some the macro trends right and

341
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
so we noticed for example that seagate

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
one

343
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,160
is way back in 2018 was up at two and a

344
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
half percent now it's below two percent

345
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
and it's moving downward and that's a

346
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,600
good trend

347
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
right now at this point you're going to

348
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
ask you may ask the question and say

349
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
well okay why would you ever use seagate

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
drives right because i can see for

351
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
example the hgst drives or even the

352
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
toshiba drives are doing better

353
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
and the answer has to do very simply

354
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
with you know failure rates to us our

355
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
systems are built for failure

356
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
right at home you have a system you have

357
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,399
a drive and maybe a backup drive and

358
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
when something goes wrong you're now

359
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
down to one or the other okay when

360
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
something goes wrong when the drive

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,800
fails in our system we have it's

362
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,519
completely designed for failure

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,480
right we

364
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
have uh we use something called read

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
solomon erasure coding algorithms to

366
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
parse data out

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,399
in our case we have 20 different drives

368
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
when your data comes in it's actually

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
parsed across those 20 drives in either

370
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
17 data data bits of data in three

371
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
parity or 16 bits of data and four

372
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
parity depending on the size of the hard

373
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,519
drive

374
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
uh that we're putting the data out there

375
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
parity is the is the

376
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
uses some matrix math and all kinds of

377
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
fun stuff like that in the in the

378
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
encoding algorithm that does that takes

379
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
care of that so you can lose up to four

380
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
drives in that particular case and still

381
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
rebuild any file

382
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
in out of that that came into that that

383
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,199
what we call a tone into that 20

384
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,399
different things

385
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
so with that in mind

386
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
we are really as long as we stay within

387
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
a certain range we understand that range

388
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
and we understand the behavior of those

389
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,360
systems

390
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
we can pay less money

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,519
sea gates are traditionally cost less

392
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
than toshiba or hgst drives and so

393
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
that's great for us and we can save a

394
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
few dollars

395
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
right but when we go out and buy drives

396
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,399
we don't buy one or two we buy 5 000 or

397
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
10 000 or 20 000 and so you get various

398
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
different prices for them and all of

399
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
that so there's some interesting

400
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
economics that go on to play when in our

401
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
environment

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
now i mentioned earlier that we do a

403
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,560
report okay we actually do a quarterly

404
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
report once a quarter we do something

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
called the drive stats report some of

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
you may have even been familiar with

407
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
that

408
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,839
and

409
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
we publish it and it is as you can see

410
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,399
this this that's about all of the

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
different drive models that are current

412
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
so this is the one from the end of the

413
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,399
year uh and this is a cumulative one

414
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,000
over the lifetime of the drives and

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
that's really cool model number size

416
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
drive count average age

417
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
the two important ones of course drive

418
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,880
days drive failures and then the

419
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
annualized failure rate and then the

420
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
confidence interval

421
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
and that's because and we published that

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
because we want you to understand how

423
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,279
good that that number is so we give you

424
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,720
an annualized failure rate of 0.5 okay

425
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
like that very first one

426
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
what's the what's the range what's the

427
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
confidence interval and so 0.1 0.1.2 is

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
great okay if you're between that low

429
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
and high that's a great number that

430
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,600
means

431
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,720
that .5 apr okay afr excuse me is

432
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,399
really really solid okay and you can

433
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
expect that to continue uh for a while

434
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
wider ones of course um not so much

435
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,759
especially newer drives that haven't

436
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
been around a while we only have a few

437
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
of them that confidence interval is

438
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,959
really wide

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
and at that point you have to go well i

440
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,720
i see the number but i don't know if i

441
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
trust the number uh and a good example

442
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,199
of that might be way all the way down at

443
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
the bottom the wdc one which is a good

444
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
looking 16 terabyte drive yay and it's

445
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
got a ridiculously low rate annualized

446
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
failure rate of 0.14

447
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
but that confidence interval's kind of

448
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
wide it's 0.8 somewhat all right and so

449
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,079
you don't know if that number's still

450
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
got plenty of room to go up uh and rise

451
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,279
and so so those are we publish those on

452
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
a regular basis like i said

453
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,160
to give people insights into how

454
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
our environment works for drive failures

455
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
now what else can we do with knowing

456
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,360
this information about drives right well

457
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
if any of you are in engineering or any

458
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
of that kind of stuff i know you you

459
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
probably most of you are cyber students

460
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
but you've probably heard of something

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,279
called the bathtub curve right the idea

462
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
that components fail early on they

463
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
settle into a rate in the middle of low

464
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
failure rates and then the increase as

465
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
things wear out going along

466
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,160
and

467
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,959
we wanted to test and see

468
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,839
if that was the case with hard drives

469
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
right we had never seen that before so

470
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
way back in 2013 one of the first things

471
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
we did as we started collecting this

472
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,559
data was to do that this is by quarter

473
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
and then at the bottom you can see it's

474
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,400
year so one two three four we were able

475
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
to go back about four years before the

476
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
data started to get a little squirrely

477
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,079
and if you look at that you kind of get

478
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,079
that sense that it looks kind of like a

479
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
bathtub curve right it's it starts up

480
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,039
kind of high and it wanders down um it

481
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
hits that constant rate in the middle

482
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
which is really kind of nice look below

483
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,840
choose 2 1 or so there and then at the

484
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
end it drives back up so we had a

485
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
bathtub curve and it looked like hard

486
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
drives as a group followed

487
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,799
the bathtub curve

488
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
well this past year i decided to go back

489
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
and take a look and see if that was

490
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
still the case

491
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
and

492
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
what we found right was

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it doesn't look like it

494
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
right and we also had six years worth of

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
data which stretched out the curve a

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
little bit

497
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
and you'll see that in a second how they

498
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
compare right but the front end of that

499
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
curve the decreasing part really doesn't

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,480
look like it decreases terribly much

501
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,799
right it kind of looks flat

502
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
and then it slowly drops down into that

503
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
constant area and then it starts to come

504
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
up and it takes a long time before it

505
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
really gets to be bad like in year six

506
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,679
or so five or so um where it starts to

507
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,400
get those rates really start to get high

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,760
again right and and it kind of it didn't

509
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,039
feel like

510
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,760
a bathtub curve anymore i it was i kind

511
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,640
of said well it's it's pretty shallow um

512
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,320
in the middle there and it kind of leaks

513
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,440
off to the left-hand side

514
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
so when we put both of those together

515
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
okay you can see the difference here

516
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
right you can see how one kind of looks

517
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,520
like a bathtub the other one almost

518
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,840
doesn't look like one at all

519
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
but as we all know

520
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
looks can be

521
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
deceiving right we always want to do a

522
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
little bit further analysis when you

523
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,919
start to look right and something may

524
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
look right and so we dug into the 2021

525
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,400
data again

526
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
and we plotted it out and we said okay

527
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
great and then we threw a trend curve on

528
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
there it's a second-order polynomial and

529
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
you can see how the curve kind of looks

530
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
if you follow the curve all the way from

531
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
the beginning all the way to the end

532
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,679
it

533
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,080
doesn't really look like a bathtub curve

534
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,799
but

535
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
the interesting thing about it is if you

536
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,480
stop on that curve at about year four

537
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,720
you suddenly get the bathtub curve back

538
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,919
so the first four years seem to fit

539
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,919
and what that's kind of telling us is

540
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
the data that we have in in years five

541
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
and and leading up to six right

542
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
are

543
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,120
are

544
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
probably too thin to make a good

545
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
judgment with

546
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
right and these are the kinds of things

547
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
we challenge ourselves with all of the

548
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,440
time so even though it doesn't quite

549
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
look like the bathtub car was working it

550
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
seems to be holding for the first four

551
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
or five years we still get that same

552
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
effect of

553
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
a higher rate of incident at the

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
beginning a nice settling at the middle

555
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
and then drives start to fail a little

556
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,760
longer

557
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
over time drives are lasting longer okay

558
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
they seem to be lasting five and six

559
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
years and in our case we have

560
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
there's a particular model is um a six

561
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
terabyte seagate model that we have

562
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,159
that's almost seven years old now and

563
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
it's still under one percent failure

564
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
rates which is just stunning we have

565
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
some of the four terabyte hgsts which

566
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
are uh six years old and they're under a

567
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,799
half percent failure rate um amazing but

568
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,159
at some point they're gonna start

569
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
failing um and so if you ever wanna know

570
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
how long drives last maybe uh that's

571
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
what the next one is

572
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,400
okay

573
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
life expectancy

574
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
because most people and

575
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
most people you'll run into don't care

576
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
about annualized failure rates um and or

577
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
anything they don't think that way when

578
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,039
they walk into a store and they say i

579
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,120
want to buy a hard drive

580
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,919
right

581
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,600
what they think about is how long is

582
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
something going to last you don't go and

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
buy a washing machine and say uh what's

584
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,679
the annualized failure rate of this

585
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,120
washing machine it's just not the way

586
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
human we're programmed to to think

587
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
consumers as that is scientists

588
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,200
different story um but um but we're

589
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
programmed to think about how long

590
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
something's going to last so we used uh

591
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,080
kaplan-meier projections in order to to

592
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,640
model the data out and and i'm not the

593
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
first to do this we've actually had a

594
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
couple of folks who downloaded all of

595
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
our data and did the same thing now god

596
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,080
bless them um and and got similar types

597
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
of numbers that we had and what we see

598
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,880
here

599
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,760
is

600
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
you buy something you buy a hard drive

601
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,640
today and at the end of four years

602
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,559
there's a 90 percent chance that drive's

603
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,840
still going to be working which is a

604
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
pretty good number okay all in all now

605
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
if you're that 10 it didn't

606
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,159
right

607
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
always have a backup that's you know

608
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
that's our motto so to speak right

609
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,919
but you can start to see that by the

610
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,080
time you get out into the year six and

611
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
close to year seven now you're dealing

612
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
with a 50 number and that starts to get

613
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,039
really scary that's just a coin flip

614
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,640
as to whether your drive is going to be

615
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
alive or not so

616
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
when you start to think about

617
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,159
whether you're going to buy a hard drive

618
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,919
like i said if it's an external unit

619
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,679
maybe you start to think about hey i

620
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,960
think it's going to last three or four

621
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
years and then i'm going to have to

622
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
replace it and just make that part of

623
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,840
the way you think

624
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,159
and that can be pretty helpful uh going

625
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
forward

626
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,679
now

627
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,919
i mentioned earlier the smart stats and

628
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,039
and here's just an exploded view of that

629
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,360
so you can see how we collect the data

630
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
in this smart one smart 2 smart 3 smart

631
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
4 going all the way across

632
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
and there's a raw value and a normalized

633
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
value for each of those and each of

634
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
those has a meaning to the particular

635
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
drive that it's in

636
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
not all smart stats are reported for

637
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
each drive as a matter of fact a given

638
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,039
drive might report only 30 or 40

639
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,679
different ones um but they all report

640
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,600
some common ones that we can go and look

641
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,640
at

642
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
so we started looking at the smart stats

643
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
and

644
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,039
again they all mean something and some

645
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
of them are things like um you know

646
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
media wear and so on uh more recently we

647
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,039
started looking at ssds which we're not

648
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,360
going to talk about much today

649
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
but uh to see if uh how they're doing

650
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,280
right

651
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,559
and um and and they also have smart

652
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
stats and we're beginning to dig into

653
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,679
those as well

654
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
so i wanted to point out some things

655
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,720
that we looked at over the coming of the

656
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
last several years as it relates to

657
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
using these smart stats and the kinds of

658
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
things that you can find and we found

659
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
that are in there

660
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
first one is can answer a question for

661
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
us about temperature

662
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
right so

663
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
is the temperature of your hard drive

664
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
going to affect its failure rate in

665
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,559
other words

666
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
uh you know do do i really need to keep

667
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
it cool now the first answer is is

668
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,840
keep it cool okay

669
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
you know the um you know try to keep it

670
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
a fan on it and all of those kinds of

671
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
things because at some point you're

672
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
gonna run out of luck with it right uh

673
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
the operating range of most hard drives

674
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,320
is between 0 and 60 degrees celsius all

675
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
right and you'll see that on there you

676
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
want to stay very comfortably staying

677
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,679
something in the 70 to 90 degree

678
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
fahrenheit range

679
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
which is you know you know 25 to 33 or

680
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,799
so in celsius most of us in the u.s

681
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,600
don't think that way so fahrenheit

682
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,080
we took all of our drives and we looked

683
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,679
at and we looked at the operational ones

684
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,440
one's still running and then the ones

685
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
that had failed and we compared them we

686
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,960
said okay so

687
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
you know what was the temperature at

688
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,799
approximately the time they failed and

689
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,159
not right at the time they failed you go

690
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,520
back a little bit

691
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
because as they fail they might heat up

692
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
or something or they might cool down

693
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
um so he took an average um but the

694
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
interesting thing is is when you plot

695
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,080
them out

696
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
okay those curves

697
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,799
kind of look the same right there's no

698
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,440
skewing like oh my goodness um all of

699
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
the failed drives are on fire um and

700
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,880
there's there's 60 70 80 degrees in

701
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
celsius out there we just didn't see

702
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
that um you just don't see it in the

703
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
data you see a little bit of warmth

704
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,960
there at like 39 41 and so on and so

705
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
forth where it's obvious there's

706
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
something going on there but it's just

707
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
not prolific

708
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
temperature doesn't seem to bother

709
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,919
drives too much and this goes all the

710
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,159
way back to 2007 our friends at google

711
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,880
did a study and they found this and we

712
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
retested it like i said i retested it

713
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
this last year and this is what we found

714
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
it kind of confirms that

715
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,440
but interestingly enough and we'll see

716
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
this in a little bit sometimes

717
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
temperature works its way into the

718
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,159
equation right but for the most part

719
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,400
keep your drive running keep it happy

720
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
keep it at a reasonable temperature in

721
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
your house or whatever you'll be fine

722
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
that's not going to be the problem now

723
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,720
if you have a

724
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
like a tower a pc tower or something

725
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,760
like that

726
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,559
and it's uh and you stuffed it into a

727
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,159
cabinet and it's got no ventilation and

728
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,919
there's a million dust bunnies behind it

729
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,080
and all of that all bets are off at that

730
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,919
point because you're probably punishing

731
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,600
those drives inside

732
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,279
this is by the way the internal drive

733
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
temperature so this is what the drives

734
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
think like or they are inside

735
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
um and so

736
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,159
you know

737
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,279
temperature is generally not a problem

738
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,000
but

739
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,919
don't tempt fate you know keep them and

740
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,440
keep them nice keep them in your house

741
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,159
like i said and you'll be fine

742
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,360
um power cycling right the age-old

743
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,039
question

744
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
do you turn it off at night or do you

745
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
leave it on

746
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,200
right and you know your grandma turns it

747
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
off because she's going to save a tenth

748
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,600
of a watt of electricity um and you know

749
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,919
you you probably don't uh you probably

750
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,000
slam the lid closed on your laptop and

751
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,960
call it a day now most drives when they

752
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
are not busy they turn themselves off

753
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
right they they put themselves in sleep

754
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
mode and then they wake themselves back

755
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
up uh these days all right but we wanted

756
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
to test the theory and we we at least

757
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
wanted to see what we could find out and

758
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,720
we looked at our drives right as of the

759
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,760
end of

760
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,880
12 yeah as the end of december

761
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
um and we said okay so what's the uh

762
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
average number of times a good drive

763
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,799
fails a good drive um you know has been

764
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,120
turned off and on and then

765
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
for the failed drives how often they

766
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,039
turned on and you can see the numbers

767
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,679
just aren't that different right you

768
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
certainly couldn't come to anything that

769
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
says there's a correlation between

770
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
failure and turning a drive off and on

771
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,799
it just just doesn't seem to be there

772
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,919
now the only downside is is we don't

773
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,080
turn off our drives a whole lot we don't

774
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
turn them off every day and every night

775
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,120
um because people like to store data

776
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,480
with us and it's 24 7 and so on so

777
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,559
maybe there's something that says hey

778
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,440
after i get to 50 or 60 or 70 or 100

779
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
times in a year maybe there's a problem

780
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
um but for our sites we couldn't see

781
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
anything that was that different right

782
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,279
and we even looked at it over time

783
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,279
we said hey is there any relationship

784
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,360
between power cycles and time so

785
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
something like you know if i start

786
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
turning it off and on and after it's

787
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
older uh that will cause it to fail more

788
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,799
and the answer doesn't seem to be any no

789
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,200
it just doesn't seem to be related

790
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,320
at all uh so it doesn't matter whether a

791
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,799
drive is one year old or five years old

792
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,720
okay it's it doesn't seem to have an

793
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
effect right now in turning a drive off

794
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
and on there's just no real correlation

795
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
to that

796
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,960
now one of the last things i'll talk

797
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
about and this will give us plenty of

798
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,480
time for questions which is great

799
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,399
um is the

800
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,880
is predicting hard drive failure all

801
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,440
right and we first saw the first paper i

802
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
saw was that from some folks in ibm

803
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,559
there

804
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
marella and company

805
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,559
and they used some what i would call

806
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,360
traditional methods uh to try to figure

807
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,799
it out and they were actually pretty

808
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
good at being able to predict failure

809
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
drive failure

810
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
especially like three or four days out

811
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,279
and but really really good they could

812
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,159
get 97 accuracy on a particular drive

813
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,799
model uh three days out but they needed

814
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,799
like three years worth of data to do

815
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,440
that um and three years is a long time

816
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
to wait to find out that in year four

817
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
it's gonna fail

818
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,520
um but over the years people have done

819
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,919
more and more papers on this and and

820
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,880
sometime in 2018 or 2019

821
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
people started applying machine learning

822
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
and and artificial intelligence

823
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
algorithms to

824
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
to this problem set and they take all of

825
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
our data in and they use it and in 2021

826
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
there was a paper here and i happen to

827
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,440
like this particular paper it's by the

828
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,120
folks at interpretable um and they did a

829
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
nice study and i want to just walk you

830
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
through uh the kinds of things you can

831
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,919
do

832
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,559
with the data to learn all about hard

833
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
drives right um so they took our

834
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,200
statistics remember all that data i said

835
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
before and they actually downloaded all

836
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
of it and then they took a subset of it

837
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
they were looking at one particular

838
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
drive model because we had like 30 some

839
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
odd thousand of them we had lots of data

840
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,720
on it

841
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
and they applied what's called optimal

842
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,520
decision trees technology to it and then

843
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,760
techniques and then survival curves to

844
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
it and i'll show you examples of both of

845
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
those in just a second

846
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,279
and they were able to come up with the

847
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,960
ability to predict

848
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,480
from a long-term

849
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,600
uh drive failure so in other words

850
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
more than 90 days

851
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
and then short term less than 90 days so

852
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
drive is going to fail in a certain

853
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
period of time they're even able to

854
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
squeeze the number of

855
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
records they needed down to as little as

856
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
50 000

857
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,360
which isn't a lot of data okay we were

858
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,399
giving them

859
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,000
they had something like a million

860
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
different records and they were able to

861
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,159
use 50 000 take that train their system

862
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,760
and then apply it out and test it

863
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
against the rest of them and it worked

864
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,240
uh which is pretty awesome uh when you

865
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,919
start to think about it so they're they

866
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,000
were really on top of that

867
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,799
um

868
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
let me let me see so so the optimal

869
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,200
decision trees right i don't know if any

870
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
of you guys are terribly familiar with

871
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
all of this kind of stuff but basically

872
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,519
they build this node and you can see at

873
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,320
each node there's a smart stat so in the

874
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,039
top one there it says five the raw value

875
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
of smart stat number five and down below

876
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
it's the normalized value of smart stat

877
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,799
number three and they were looking at

878
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,039
all these different values and they run

879
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,600
the drives through one at a time and the

880
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
drive this has how they train their

881
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
model okay to build the uh the trees out

882
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,519
and when they get all the way down to

883
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,919
the bottom you get a set of criteria

884
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
that says hey like node 15 and node 24

885
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
which we'll take a look at in a minute

886
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,519
says this is how you get to this node

887
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,880
and node 15 is 88.9 so there was an 89

888
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,799
88.9 percent

889
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,679
um

890
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,640
survivability at that point um and so on

891
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,559
so let's take a look

892
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,640
healthy drives right

893
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
uh they used uh kaplan-meier curves

894
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,559
again healthy right and if that smart

895
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,600
stats lined up with those values or in

896
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
the ranges of those values as they

897
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,720
predict right

898
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
they will they could say that drive has

899
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
an 88.8

900
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
chance of lasting 90 days

901
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,799
that's pretty good for us okay it's

902
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,960
particularly good because we're we can

903
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
fix a drive within a short period of

904
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
time right and we uh you know a couple

905
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
of days sometimes but you know so all we

906
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,200
really need to care about is is it going

907
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,760
to last a little while longer but start

908
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,080
to think about the applications of that

909
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,559
when you start moving your data centers

910
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,320
from big gigantic things in the middle

911
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,720
out to what they call the edge

912
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,559
and there are smaller groups of drives

913
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,080
out there and you can't get a technician

914
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,760
out there for a week and all of that

915
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,440
this becomes to be really really

916
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
interesting and important right on the

917
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,679
flip side

918
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
is unhealthy drives

919
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,200
so if you had a drive that met these

920
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,559
conditions

921
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,919
that was going to fail okay it had an 11

922
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,760
it was it was going to fail and you can

923
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,679
see how quickly it was going to fail if

924
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,360
i had a drive with these conditions i

925
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,960
had i should have a guy on a scooter

926
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
running for that drive to replace it

927
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
because it's going to fail almost

928
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,679
inevitably really soon and they were

929
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
able to do things like say

930
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
like i said predict

931
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
this kind of capability get that drive

932
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,200
out of here night now you have 24 hours

933
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
right and that's really important to

934
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,360
places like us it's in if it's important

935
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
to us then it's important to you by

936
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
proxy because you want to make sure that

937
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
we

938
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,399
can store your data um you know and

939
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,080
companies like us can store your data

940
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,240
and stay on top of it and keep the

941
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,480
what's called durability of our entire

942
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,159
system up and running so whenever you

943
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,239
ask for something you get it back and

944
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,760
you know it's there

945
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,359
so so that's

946
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
a little bit about hard drives and all

947
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
kinds of interesting things i hope i'm

948
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,639
guessing you didn't know

949
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
right um and you know we talked a little

950
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
bit about why we care and all those

951
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
kinds of things about the data we

952
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,320
collect and failures and all that kind

953
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
of stuff i really like the i really like

954
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,800
looking at the smart stats and trying to

955
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
dig out interesting little things like

956
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,719
temperature um and and other things that

957
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,000
apply

958
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
to the human condition the whole idea

959
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
i i've spent the last couple of years

960
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,800
looking at the can i turn a drive off or

961
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,280
leave it on and i it saddens me that i

962
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
can't come up with a good answer um and

963
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
the only answer seems to be it doesn't

964
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,159
seem to matter um so maybe your grandma

965
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,400
was right after all of these years um

966
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,960
but um but those are fun things to look

967
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
at and but the real exciting part is in

968
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
that whole predictive area right where i

969
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,119
can get

970
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
the ability to figure out if something's

971
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
going to happen ahead of time

972
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,720
in a perfect world

973
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,960
i would replace every drive before it

974
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,599
failed the reason is very simple

975
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,760
okay if i can take that drive out before

976
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,599
it fails i can do something called clone

977
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,400
it and put it back in put its clone back

978
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
in and have that system up and running

979
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,040
within a half a day if i have to remove

980
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
that drive when it fails i have to

981
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,280
rebuild the entire contents of that

982
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,119
drive when i put a new one in which is

983
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,400
empty and that can take a week two weeks

984
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
right you're not losing any data because

985
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,079
of all the redundancies we have built in

986
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,000
there but it just means that the

987
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,160
durability of the system

988
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,400
comes down a little bit so all kinds of

989
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,880
fun stuff to do um all kinds of things

990
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,680
there

991
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,520
let's take a look and see what kinds of

992
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,960
questions we we have out there

993
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
let's see

994
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,240
questions blah blah blah sorry late

995
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
murray all right well i'll give you guys

996
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
a chance to uh see if you had any

997
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,520
questions we talked all kinds of

998
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
different things um about um about

999
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,520
drives um how does this apply to you

1000
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,839
guys as security folks okay it's a good

1001
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,560
question um one of the things i saw

1002
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,599
recently right was somebody had talked

1003
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
about the fact that

1004
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,160
ssds all right have have a data section

1005
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,359
where you write data and then they have

1006
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,119
another section where the system keeps

1007
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,960
track of things like smart stats and all

1008
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,000
of that

1009
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
and somebody had put a virus

1010
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,760
into a piece of malware into that

1011
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,480
section of the code in the system so

1012
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,240
even if you wiped the drive you didn't

1013
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,920
wipe the malware

1014
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,440
um so

1015
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,040
and that was a tough one to find it was

1016
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,240
actually something that happened in a

1017
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040
manufacturing facility right so start to

1018
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,800
think about that and how you would

1019
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
detect it and how you would get rid of

1020
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
that and what you would do about it when

1021
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
you can't even format that particular

1022
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
part of the hard drive or in this case

1023
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,720
an ssd and the same thing by the way

1024
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,400
happens as well uh with um with hard

1025
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,599
drives they have that protected area

1026
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,280
and we uh we've we can now format it

1027
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
because we get from the manufacturer a

1028
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
formatting mechanism that formats the

1029
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
whole drive so for example when a drive

1030
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,000
does go bad for us one of the things we

1031
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,240
want to do is make sure it's cleaned of

1032
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,839
all of the data

1033
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,839
that's out there and we run these these

1034
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,359
particular applications and they make

1035
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,880
sure that the entire drive is

1036
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,720
reformatted and not just where the data

1037
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
resides

1038
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,599
that were out there

1039
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,400
so

1040
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,200
lots of good things going on um

1041
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
as it relates to secured as it relates

1042
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
to hard drives um

1043
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
uh the the whole idea of course uh for

1044
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,640
us is keeping things encrypted when we

1045
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,599
store them um and uh you guys are

1046
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
i'm pretty sure pretty familiar with the

1047
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,880
concept of encryption

1048
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,359
[Laughter]

1049
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,280
and how it all works that's what you're

1050
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,160
looking for um whenever uh whenever you

1051
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
want to store data somewhere um you know

1052
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,400
and you all know that you

1053
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,320
i'm sure you all have your home systems

1054
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,960
um or your even your school systems uh

1055
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,880
have the data turned on have uh file

1056
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
locker or whatever the particular

1057
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,880
application is and so the drive is and

1058
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
if you don't shame on you go home and do

1059
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,560
it immediately

1060
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
and and make sure that when you do

1061
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,079
things like store data on external

1062
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,720
drives that it's also encrypted because

1063
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
if you put it on there in plain text

1064
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,560
and you lose that external drive

1065
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,880
so um you know little lessons to

1066
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,200
remember as you go along

1067
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,839
all right um i think uh well we didn't

1068
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,000
have any questions which is fine

1069
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,440
either i did an excellent job or

1070
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,240
everybody is still asleep um but it is

1071
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
uh it is later in the day we're not

1072
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
we're we're not sleeping i just feel

1073
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,599
actually we learn a lot of fracturing

1074
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
with this data because this data is from

1075
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,839
you actually you teach a lot of things

1076
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,079
we do not know i'm sorry because i as

1077
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,920
the penalties i cannot type the question

1078
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
so the only the the attendees can have

1079
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,800
actually i want to say we we are not

1080
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
sleeping actually i feel this you show a

1081
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,800
lot of action the great numbers and help

1082
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,359
us to know oh oh this is healthy of the

1083
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,560
hard drive

1084
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
we didn't know that before

1085
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,119
yeah

1086
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
and i wanted to uh

1087
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
so it's important the other little thing

1088
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
to know

1089
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,680
um and and and

1090
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,000
is that again that data set's open it's

1091
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
available for anybody to download and

1092
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
one of the things we've seen

1093
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,000
is um is a number of different

1094
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
universities actually download the data

1095
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,880
so they can use so they can practice

1096
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,320
okay building

1097
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
building models um and so on and so

1098
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,119
forth which and even in security even in

1099
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
the cyber spaces is certainly part of

1100
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,520
what you're doing on a real-time basis

1101
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,119
and you know because you can go through

1102
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,240
and you have enough data to do a

1103
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,400
training set and then you can test it

1104
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
against the actual real data to see if

1105
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,520
it works out

1106
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
and that's what we've seen um the data's

1107
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,920
actually been used cited about a hundred

1108
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,000
times in the last three or four years

1109
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,440
with various different studies and

1110
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
papers and all kinds of things like that

1111
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,920
and so you guys may find that useful to

1112
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,880
do it is free i don't care

1113
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,560
to go and download it have a great old

1114
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,400
time if you do something interesting

1115
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,280
tell me about it that's always cool um

1116
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,880
because we like to talk about things

1117
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,920
like that

1118
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,319
and highlight those kinds of things uh

1119
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,760
and um you know and uh but it's it's

1120
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
there um and that's that's really cool

1121
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,359
so you can see some of the things i do

1122
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,200
with it on a regular basis and i'm not

1123
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
nearly as good

1124
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,280
at uh stats and statistics and so on as

1125
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,319
many of you are so um always good uh

1126
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,839
always good to take a look at that data

1127
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,560
and see what's going on

1128
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
let's see

1129
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,760
there's your red back

1130
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,560
[Laughter]

1131
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,280
uh

1132
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,119
we we do have a question can you say the

1133
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,880
question is the q and a we have two

1134
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
questions comes out can you say that or

1135
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
do you need me to read that for you

1136
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,800
uh why don't you read them for me please

1137
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
oh yes so the first question from the

1138
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,119
patrick you just ask

1139
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,200
is there any correlation between the

1140
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,079
driver failing and the file size or

1141
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,839
warrior

1142
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,880
so that's a that's a good question we um

1143
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
uh it's not file size that we see a

1144
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,240
correlation for um we do see a

1145
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,720
correlation and and that's all we can do

1146
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,599
at this point between uh failure rates

1147
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,319
and drive size so the size of dry

1148
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,400
weather it's a four six and eight or so

1149
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,280
on and the drives we have go from four

1150
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
up to 16 right now terabytes each right

1151
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,000
um and

1152
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,960
it does rise um over time so

1153
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,560
the the failure rates seem to go up um

1154
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,880
as as the drives get bigger

1155
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,200
right and but you have to be really

1156
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,960
careful about that because one of the

1157
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
things you want to make sure of is you

1158
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,119
got them in the same time

1159
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,440
uh remember remember that the uh the

1160
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
bathtub curve right you want to make

1161
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,960
sure you're looking at all of the drives

1162
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,200
in their first year of operation

1163
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,800
and all their drives in the second year

1164
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
of operation and so on not just that

1165
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,680
just not on december 1st because then

1166
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,720
you're going to they're going to be all

1167
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,000
over the board

1168
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,640
and so where most of our

1169
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,599
larger drives the 14s and 16s are only

1170
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,240
about a year a year and a half old and

1171
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,480
so while they look they look a little

1172
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,160
they don't look as good

1173
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,359
right now it's it's really early to tell

1174
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,760
but right now we're seeing a little bit

1175
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,800
of a rise in the failure rates and and

1176
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
it kind of makes some sense i mean the

1177
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,560
complexity

1178
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,119
a couple of years ago before before

1179
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,560
coven and all of this stuff i got a

1180
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,640
chance to go to the

1181
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,240
the seagate

1182
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,160
prototyping facility in longmont

1183
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,599
colorado and they walked me through

1184
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,440
how they built a hard drive and they had

1185
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,880
all the machines and everything like

1186
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,400
that

1187
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,040
it is amazing okay for what you're

1188
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,440
getting what you're getting for 49 when

1189
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,000
you buy one terabyte hard drive much

1190
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,960
less a 16 terabyte hard drive with eight

1191
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,119
or nine platters

1192
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,560
spinning at 7 200 or more rpms

1193
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,800
revolutions per minute right with a

1194
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,720
whole bunch of read write heads stuffed

1195
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,359
in between all of these things flying

1196
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,920
you know a couple of nanometers above

1197
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
the surface

1198
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,599
and still being able to pick out dots

1199
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,000
that are the the pluses and the ones and

1200
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,240
zeros in order to get your data off of

1201
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,599
there it

1202
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,920
it's an amazing amount of technology

1203
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,599
that's in there it's amazing it doesn't

1204
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,160
fail like every day right

1205
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,839
um so the mere fact that it's lasting

1206
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,000
five or six years and they're pushing

1207
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,119
that out

1208
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,960
out now like i said they're talking

1209
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,119
about nine platters in in three and a

1210
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,599
half inch platform um they're looking at

1211
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,079
technologies that are using uh hammer

1212
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,200
which is uh heat assisted uh read and

1213
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,079
write and mammor which is uh m um

1214
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,920
i can't think of the right word uh

1215
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
anyway

1216
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,440
that's a another technology which helps

1217
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,359
put the dots in place and all of this

1218
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,440
kind of stuff and creating something

1219
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
called aerial density and all of that is

1220
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,480
just amazing what's going on

1221
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
um and again half the world's data is

1222
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,680
going to be on these things in 2025

1223
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
anyway ssds by the way are pretty cool

1224
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,960
too so don't get me wrong but but

1225
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,359
they're not electromechanical okay these

1226
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,359
are this is all an electrical mechanical

1227
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,760
system which is like i said divided

1228
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,839
built in in 1956 by ibm and the same

1229
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,319
basic principles that are

1230
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,400
put in then are still working today and

1231
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,000
we've been able to scale them and it's

1232
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,240
it's just amazing

1233
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,480
actually andy i really for me i already

1234
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,000
wanted your comments about the ssd and

1235
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,599
the hard drive but because we have two

1236
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,000
more questions from qri so let me know

1237
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,920
and the one more so we have still have

1238
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
two more questions and the one question

1239
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
is from chris he just asked you know you

1240
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,319
know right now we can actually predict

1241
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,400
her right the statics we can get action

1242
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,319
but this practice shows actually you

1243
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
know the correlation between

1244
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
smart and the failure is kind of a

1245
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,520
short-term prediction so he should

1246
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,480
wonder

1247
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,720
um how can we leverage this one it's

1248
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,240
difficult for us to leverage this one to

1249
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,800
extend our drive live so just ask her

1250
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
can you say actually an unclear

1251
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,280
correlation that would help us to get

1252
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
that better drive

1253
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,000
from yeah yeah so it all depends if

1254
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,280
you're just you know a regular user okay

1255
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,960
you're you're not going to be you're not

1256
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,440
going to have the enough data available

1257
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,359
to you to do it some of the newer

1258
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,960
systems i've seen

1259
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,480
computers and so on and so forth

1260
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,319
actually monitor some of these smart

1261
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,520
stats

1262
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,319
and

1263
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,400
and they will report to you hey i think

1264
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
the hard drive is failing

1265
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,240
and and that's kind of cool that they're

1266
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
doing some of that

1267
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,800
but you as a regular user who's not very

1268
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,880
familiar with the utilities and stuff

1269
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,240
now if you're familiar with something

1270
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,400
called um smart ctl or whatever

1271
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,920
application

1272
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,839
you can run on your computer that

1273
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,680
monitors all of these stats and you can

1274
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,200
look at all of that and start to make

1275
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,480
some judgments that's really cool um but

1276
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
um but most people can't do that you

1277
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,560
have to rely on the manufacturer telling

1278
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,960
you the best thing to do

1279
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200
is have it you know has a backup i mean

1280
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,040
we always preach something called 321

1281
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,760
backup which is you need three copies of

1282
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,920
something before it's real

1283
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,240
one on your laptop one on an external

1284
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
drive and one someplace else i don't

1285
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,599
care if it's in the cloud or whatever

1286
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,680
just someplace else right um three

1287
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,079
copies and and then two is just on two

1288
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,520
different media which is don't put them

1289
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,880
both on the same hard drive kind of

1290
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,599
thing and then one copy off site right

1291
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,000
um and if you think that way

1292
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,079
then it really then i don't wanna say it

1293
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,240
really doesn't matter but you have less

1294
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,800
worry about your particular hard drive

1295
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,119
running inside your system but to your

1296
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,880
point

1297
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,520
there are some tools available they are

1298
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,160
not terribly user friendly sometimes

1299
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,319
they're built into the operating system

1300
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,079
or some of the applications may come

1301
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,599
with your system and it will tell you

1302
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,319
that your hard drive or ssd is failing

1303
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,880
um and uh and then try not to ignore

1304
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,440
them like most people will um so

1305
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
black plaza is the professional action

1306
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,240
cloud storage company so you'd have to

1307
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,720
look into this data and then

1308
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,319
right make the hard drive work longer

1309
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,680
and healthy and um combat with this kind

1310
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,400
of experience class yeah yeah yeah you

1311
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,839
are professional right wait wait wait

1312
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,599
but not okay then

1313
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,359
we have one more question actually i

1314
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,359
think which is very useful because it's

1315
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,680
really into our daily life so he just

1316
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,040
asked you know so this is very

1317
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
interesting question so we just asked

1318
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,800
you know what's the failing rate over

1319
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,480
time will apply to

1320
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,440
the active hdd or this kind of

1321
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,079
non-active sdd because usually we have

1322
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,319
like i said we have a hard drive running

1323
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,119
24 hours seven days but we also have

1324
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,839
some big kind of storage and which just

1325
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,200
uh with external hdd which is the power

1326
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,960
of when the most time they are they do

1327
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,079
not work

1328
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,559
so just ask you know this failing rate

1329
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,440
over time will make a difference for

1330
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,920
this two different working mode because

1331
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,079
he worry he has a hard disc maybe

1332
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,079
thought some very important fact that

1333
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,520
this is from us

1334
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,200
it's still something may be impossible

1335
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,960
for us actually for more than two years

1336
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,559
we want to make sure it's still working

1337
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,240
right

1338
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,040
right

1339
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,440
so yeah he's uh so

1340
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,040
you know we we obviously keep them

1341
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,240
running 24 7. that's absolutely right um

1342
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,359
and and but what we see is um

1343
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,960
and this is just

1344
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
after years and years of talking with

1345
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,400
folks a lot of folks take it like you

1346
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,160
see they say create an external hard

1347
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,079
drive and they put their data on there

1348
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,440
and then after they're done storing

1349
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,040
everything they stick they put it in the

1350
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,319
closet

1351
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,680
um and

1352
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,280
what happens is is the drives are really

1353
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,559
meant to spin

1354
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,000
okay

1355
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,520
and and

1356
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,720
they just seem to fail a lot more often

1357
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,520
after they sit for a long period of time

1358
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,680
and we've seen this with individuals

1359
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,920
we've seen this with many businesses

1360
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,960
that used uh external hard drives to

1361
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
store second copies of things and they

1362
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,920
create this closet of you know a hundred

1363
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,520
external hard drives with all of their

1364
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
data on it and then

1365
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,760
they would have a failure rate of 20

1366
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,240
percent taking them out of there um and

1367
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,400
that's a crazy number all right

1368
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,559
because they're just they just sat for a

1369
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,200
long period of time one two

1370
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,359
sometimes the conditions in your closet

1371
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,440
or whatever are not particularly nice it

1372
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,200
really does get warm in there in the

1373
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,599
summertime and it really does get cold

1374
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,359
in there in the wintertime and even

1375
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,880
though i said temperature doesn't have a

1376
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,119
whole lot of effect it's that swings

1377
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,599
back and forth that can be it and then

1378
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,200
you know the components are meant to

1379
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,160
work

1380
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,400
and so if you suddenly turn it on and

1381
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,119
and they're you know maybe maybe

1382
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,280
they've been sitting too long so i i

1383
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,200
always encourage folks who have external

1384
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
hard drives to plug them in

1385
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,440
every so often just to see if they're

1386
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,559
used

1387
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,079
they're ready they're they're still

1388
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,280
working um and don't expect them to last

1389
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,359
10 years although you know sometimes

1390
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,720
they do

1391
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
and good on you if they do

1392
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,599
but um i i always you know maybe once a

1393
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,359
year whatever the case may be bring them

1394
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,599
out of the closet plug them in make sure

1395
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,760
everything's still there do a disk check

1396
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,280
you know file system check or whatever

1397
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,559
the case may be

1398
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,960
and um and see if that

1399
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
that drive is still up to snuff

1400
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,559
um and make sure it's not the only copy

1401
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,079
of something if you take all your

1402
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,599
family's photos and stick it on an

1403
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,800
external drive and that's your only copy

1404
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,280
please make another copy you know

1405
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,040
right

1406
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,160
yeah so

1407
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,000
andy i said it's very useful so it's

1408
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,599
more like you know we should check you

1409
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,920
know the external storage you document

1410
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
right like this once a year because the

1411
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,640
frequency the the use frequency of

1412
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,720
course we are affected the lifetime but

1413
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
also you know the

1414
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,640
the the total time is also affects the

1415
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,720
lifetime right the heart disco is not oh

1416
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,240
yeah even you do not use this for for 10

1417
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,000
years it's just your life no we cannot

1418
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,640
show our hard disk or how else how to

1419
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,319
drive you know it's so reliable

1420
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,040
right yeah and and we're we we tell

1421
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
people like this is our environment

1422
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,880
yours is your mileage varies right

1423
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,119
depending on your environment but places

1424
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,640
like that where people are putting

1425
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,040
drives in closets or whatever for years

1426
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,000
on end

1427
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,680
always a good idea just to take them out

1428
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,680
and check them um you know like i said

1429
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,200
once a year once every few months

1430
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,800
whatever schedule you want to put

1431
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,680
yourself on um because it's the value of

1432
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,599
the data that's on there is is well

1433
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,720
worth it

1434
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,880
so let me maybe i can just last question

1435
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,119
from me okay so maybe you can comment

1436
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,240
then what will be actually recommended

1437
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,400
or you believe more permanent actually

1438
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,480
in the way for us to do family or

1439
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,960
personal storage it's a cloud

1440
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,880
i always like i said we always say three

1441
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,920
two one you have your pc um or your mac

1442
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,160
or whatever um and then you probably

1443
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,839
have an external drive because you wanna

1444
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,040
have an external drive you wanna have

1445
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,720
your data close to you

1446
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,400
as a backup copy

1447
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,319
i for example use a mac and then i have

1448
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,720
a time machine external backup system

1449
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,000
and then i use of course backblaze

1450
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,559
which is a cloud storage system and

1451
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,760
between those three okay over the last

1452
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,839
10 years since i've worked at backlash

1453
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,079
i've crashed three systems and i've

1454
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,240
never lost a file

1455
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,040
i've always been able to recover either

1456
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,319
off of

1457
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,680
time machine um or uh and or if of uh

1458
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,280
backblaze and so

1459
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,480
um you know so i it's it's been the case

1460
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,640
that i've been able to do that that way

1461
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,640
so three copies of everything in three

1462
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,880
different places uh obviously i say

1463
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,760
cloud storage for the third one but um i

1464
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,800
know people who burn who make a second

1465
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
external drive and send it to a relative

1466
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,640
in a different state

1467
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,400
whatever you need to do just get it away

1468
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,119
from your current ones get it off site

1469
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,359
it's a little easier to do cloud storage

1470
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,880
but it's up to you as to what you want

1471
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,520
to pay for and how you want to do it

1472
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,400
yeah

1473
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,240
of course you know i think you know the

1474
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,160
personnel and the cloud and all this one

1475
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,559
will be important for us to have backup

1476
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,800
one you know for lifetime our data

1477
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,400
becomes more and more and then

1478
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,240
eventually you know you put them in my

1479
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,400
mouth you can store kind of like some

1480
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,640
one terabyte but more than this one and

1481
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,400
a lot of things we have to have backup

1482
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
so actually use the solution used by

1483
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,800
nasa just external disk but i need to

1484
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,119
check this once a year to check is still

1485
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,079
working

1486
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,559
or maybe i'll forget about this data you

1487
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,640
know because this data i rarely use i

1488
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,119
cannot use the very own thing

1489
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,280
the the important thing you know and and

1490
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
and if you do store it in the cloud um

1491
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,480
you know then make sure it's it may or

1492
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,200
may not be uh under a subscription you

1493
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,720
make sure you have to make sure that

1494
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,559
stays up to date you want to make sure

1495
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,880
other people have access to your account

1496
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
in case something happens to you you got

1497
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,720
to start thinking about all of those

1498
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,240
kinds of things i mean that's just the

1499
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,280
world we're in right now um you know so

1500
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,760
um and that's fine um you know but but

1501
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,240
like i said multiple copies

1502
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,040
get them in different places um and if

1503
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,119
it's really really important to you and

1504
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,720
then check it on a regular basis and

1505
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,280
make sure you got what you expect

1506
