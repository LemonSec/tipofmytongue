1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,760
all right we're

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,920
running a little bit behind schedule

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,480
um so i'm not going to do a

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,840
uh long

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,080
introduction of our speaker who is not

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
here in person

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
um so for those of you aren't aware we

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
have uh

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,000
protection of critical infrastructure

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,720
and government civilian side uh is

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
tasked through

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
the department of homeland security and

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
cisa is the

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
uh designated

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
organization within dhs that does this

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,840
and responds to various kinds of

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,800
incidents

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,079
and uh problems i'm uh

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,879
great can can you hear me uh mr wales

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,199
yeah you're on your loud and clear

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,760
okay great um thank you

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,440
so uh uh he is going to speak to this

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
when we extended the invitation

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
things were not quite as they are now in

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
the world and particularly in ukraine

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,479
and as a result of what's been happening

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,799
there you can imagine the tempo needed

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
within government operations has

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,840
increased

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
he graciously agreed to speak to us

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
nonetheless although at a distance

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
cannot take the time out to come and

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
spend the day with us

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
there is a long bio

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
in the program so i'm not going to recap

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,159
all of that i will say he's been with

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
dhs for 17 years

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
and was the person involved in

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
responding to

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
the solar winds incident the colonial

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
pipeline incident as the acting director

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
of cisa

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
so he has a

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
real wealth of experience he's going to

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
share some of that with us today and

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
if you can stay a few minutes longer

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,320
although we ran along then we may also

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
be able to take some questions at the

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
end so without further ado

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
mr brandon wales the executive director

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
of sysup thank you so much for being

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
here

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
thank you uh thank you for that kind

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,399
introduction

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
uh really pleased to be here uh and

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
after listening to the the awards that

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
were just given out clearly among some

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
of the best minds and brightest minds in

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
cyber security in the country i'd like

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
to congratulate sirius on celebrating

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
its 30-year

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
legacy of purdue's cybersecurity work uh

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
it's quite remarkable to think about the

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,040
history of sirius in the context of what

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
cybersecurity looked like back in 1992

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
what it looks like today and i'm sure

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
what it will look like 30 years from now

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
march in particular is a notable time to

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
reflect on this since it calls to mind

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
the first ever public malware the

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
michelangelo virus

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
that

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
rocketed around the world the computer

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
users even before there was a modern

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,959
internet

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,080
uh

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
you know it's i think it's fascinating

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
to look back 30 years to think about how

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
that played out in its day since it

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,319
really was the first virus that ever

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
received kind of media

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
public media attention

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
um

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
and uh there was coverage of

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
michelangelo that talked about a time

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
bomb left in people's computers uh that

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,519
was going to lurk in the shadows and

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
then uh unload on march 6th of of any

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,239
given year

90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
um uh the media kind of had hysterical

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
reporting about it um and it also

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
featured interestingly we talked about

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
solar winds an early supply chain

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
compromise because several vendors

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
actually shipped out products uh that

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
contained the virus

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
um uh cyber security advice at the time

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
uh said relatively simple things like

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
reset your computer clock to the wrong

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
date so that it would never hit march

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
6th or just don't turn your computer on

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
on march uh on march 6th uh fortunately

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
that that scare kind of went out more

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
with the whimper than a bang

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
though it actually did persist for

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
several years worth of march 6's um the

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,000
world returned to normal uh in time to

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
replay the hysteria again around y2k

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
but i you know i kind of look back at

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
that as as kind of highlighting uh just

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
the ability for us to be prepared for

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
unforeseen events

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
um and whether it's 30 years ago or

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
today or 30 years from now people are

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
going to be looking for and relying upon

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
experts and leaders in this field

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
to help them deal with the uncertainty

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
helping them understand what they need

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
to do to prepare to defend against and

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,720
resolve the cyber security threats that

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
that we face as a country and as a

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
worldwide community

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,000
um

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
uh the recent announcements from the

125
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
white house highlighting new

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
intelligence that the russian government

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,479
is exploring options to conduct cyber

128
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
attacks against united states

129
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,639
should serve as a warning to all of us

130
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
that these threats continue to persist

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
and the obligation we all have to

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
address them

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,639
uh as eric noted the tempo was increased

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,440
here uh fairly substantially in february

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,919
uh president biden designated dhs as the

136
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,320
lead federal agency on domestic

137
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
preparedness and response and i was

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
tapped to be the senior response

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,039
official to lead the u.s government's

140
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
domestic efforts associated with this

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,960
russia ukraine crisis uh so it's a

142
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
really busy time and cisa

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
is right at the center of the action

144
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
we're tracking the rapidly changing

145
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
landscape and we are looking and

146
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
monitoring the security threats to our

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
critical infrastructure

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
we're also continuously exchanging

149
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
real-time information with the cyber

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
security our partners in in the public

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
and private sector and hopefully

152
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
providing resources to help businesses

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
of all sizes

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
assess their cyber defenses secure their

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
systems and ensure that they have uh

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,919
resilient and effective cyber defensive

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,680
strategies

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
and with much of the nation's critical

159
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
infrastructure owned and operated by the

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
private sector it is just it is just

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
essential that we work collaboratively

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
with um

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
with all of these partners to protect

164
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
the homeland

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
we actually started working on the

166
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
potential russian invasion of ukraine um

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
back in late 2021 uh when we started to

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
initially launch an outreach campaign to

169
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
raise awareness about the potential

170
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,440
growing threat environment uh and to

171
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
help organizations think through what

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
they need to do to prepare for that

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
so we launched a shields up campaign to

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
encourage organizations of all sizes to

175
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,639
adopt the heightened cybersecurity

176
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,039
posture uh provided classified and

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,160
unclassified briefings um really uh

178
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
unprecedented level of engagement uh i

179
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
went over to some of the statistics

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
yesterday uh for a briefing uh for

181
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
members of congress uh but we did over

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,759
90 engagements over the course of about

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
three months we literally briefed uh

184
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,319
about a thousand people at a classified

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
level in the private sector um and and

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
tens of thousands at the unclassified

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
level to make sure that they understood

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
uh what kind of threat we are now facing

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
and what they needed to be prepared for

190
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,759
and then we released a series of

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
products that were designed to kind of

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
help them do their jobs better

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,120
some of those products were more geared

194
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
for the higher end network defense

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,319
community in terms of our technical

196
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
mitigation and advice

197
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,479
some of it was working with our private

198
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,639
sector partners to collect a catalog of

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
free services that is available from the

200
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
government from open source community

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
from our joint cyber defense

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
collaborative partners that is made

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
available to those small and

204
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
medium-sized businesses in those small

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
communities

206
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
to make sure that they had

207
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
the ability to protect themselves in a

208
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
resource-constrained environment

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
we're also working extremely closely

210
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
with our colleagues in europe and in

211
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,039
ukraine themselves helping to exchange

212
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,880
actionable information

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
to help ukraine defend its networks

214
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
and we've also conducted a series of

215
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
bilateral sessions with the heads of of

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
the key cyber emergency response teams

217
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
on the front lines across eastern europe

218
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
lithuania latvia poland dystonia uh the

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,039
czech republic uh as well as the 16

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
certs that comprise our closest partners

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
uh globally as part of the international

222
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
watch and warning network uh the goal

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
again is to make sure that um whereas if

224
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
any one of us see something every one of

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
us can benefit from it i think you know

226
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,560
our primary goal

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
um in sisa is that no attack is

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
successful more than once

229
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
that as soon as one person sees it it

230
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
can be shared whether anonymously or not

231
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
and it gets out to the community and new

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
defenses uh new new mitigation measures

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
new compensating controls we put in

234
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,680
place uh so that it doesn't uh repeat

235
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
and you know i think now more than ever

236
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,720
the american people are counting on on

237
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
on leadership uh both at the national

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
level uh and all the way down into the

239
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
corporate community uh to successfully

240
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
navigate this incredibly complex uh

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
threat landscape and find solutions they

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
can depend upon

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
and we fully understand that there is no

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
easy answer to these problems that we

245
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
are facing in cyber security and no

246
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
organization has all of the solutions

247
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
success for everyone requires collective

248
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,279
resolve of the public and private sector

249
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
leaders to join forces

250
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
to be committed partners and to be the

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
staunch defenders of our critical

252
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
infrastructure that is required given

253
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,839
the the

254
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
the threats we face um and frankly

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
that's why partnerships are at the heart

256
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
of the sysa mission

257
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
so our agency for those who don't know

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,399
it was only formed a few years ago back

259
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,080
in 2018

260
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,560
um and our responsibility is to serve as

261
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
the lead for protecting

262
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
critical infrastructure whether that's

263
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
physical and cyber uh the the people

264
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
that underpin it we serve as the

265
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
operational lead for federal cyber

266
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,839
security working to protect the federal

267
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
civilian executive branch um and

268
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
coordinating across the entire us

269
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
government the critical infrastructure

270
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
security and resilience mission

271
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
um and and in these roles we are charged

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,279
with tackling some of the biggest

273
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
challenges facing both government uh and

274
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
industry whether it's securing large

275
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
federal networks and industrial control

276
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
systems or responding to incidents in

277
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
both the public and private sector uh

278
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,240
and that is really why we were

279
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
purpose-built as a modern cyber defense

280
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
agency designed to build and operate

281
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
really robust networks of public and

282
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
private sector partners who need to work

283
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
together to strengthen our defenses

284
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
against both of these cyber and physical

285
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
threats

286
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
and i'm really proud

287
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
that i've been part of this effort

288
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
helping to build and mature its

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
capabilities

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,480
um and and considering the rich legacy

291
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
uh at purdue and it's serious uh and the

292
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,600
world-class cyber leadership um that you

293
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
uh you have shown and demonstrated uh it

294
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
is really uh invaluable opportunity for

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
highlighting some of our key initiatives

299
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
here and the work that we are doing um

300
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
including work that we are uh doing

301

globally um and i also want to give you

303
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
a glimpse into how the the achievements

of you the students uh who are taking

305
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
part in this in this uh symposium uh

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
really will help chart the future of

307
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,279
cyber security um and i'll obviously

308
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
shamelessly ask that you consider

309
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
joining a career in cisa

310
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
since we are always looking to expand

311
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
our ranks with talented cyber security

312
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
professionals

313
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,600
but i want to start with partnership

314
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
since i you know kind of closed with it

315
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
a few minutes ago and and just um it's

316
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,600
it's so essential to what we what we do

317
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
here um and we really are looking to

318
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,399
kind of dramatically change how we how

319
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,040
we handle our partnerships and last year

320
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,160
we established something called the

321
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,079
joint cyber defense collaborative to

322
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
lead the development of of integrated

323
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
cyber defense plans with both the

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
government and industry

325
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
um and it joins the authorities

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,800
capabilities and talents of the

327
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
government both cisa

328
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,160
the nsa fbi cyber command doj the

329
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,519
department you know the director of

330
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
national intelligence really with the

331
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,040
the amazing expertise of of industry

332
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,680
um and uh we brought together as part of

333
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
the kind of core joint cyber defense

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
collaborative members uh 25 of the most

335
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
um uh important companies in cyber

336
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
security and technology whether those

337
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
the major cyber security firms the

338
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,079
technology firms whose equipment helps

339
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
protect uh tens of thousands of of

340
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
customers throughout the country uh the

341
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
major cloud providers the major internet

342
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
service providers those people who can

343
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,279
take

344
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
collective action at scale

345
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,519
and it provides us shared situational

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
awareness of the threat landscape so

347
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
instead of people sharing information

348
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
bilaterally with cisa and then us kind

349
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
of taking that piecemeal from one or two

350
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
or three different folks and then trying

351
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
to share that information out we now

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
have created kind of a many-to-many

353
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
relationship using kind of open shared

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
technology platforms uh so that as soon

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
as one of those companies is seeing

356
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
something or one of the government

357
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
agencies seeing something we can drop it

358
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,399
into a slack channel and everyone in

359
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
this community can benefit from it begin

360
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
to add their own insights and expertise

361
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
on top of it and so we can kind of

362
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
create this better shared situational

363
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
platform uh um and and this

364
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
collaboration that will allow us to take

365
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
collective action um and this is going

366
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,440
back to my earlier point where there's

367
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
no one person who has no one company no

368
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,399
one agency who has the ability

369
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
to have the level of insight that we do

370
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
when we operate collectively

371
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
and the ability to take action to to

372
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
make changes in networks that then get

373
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
deployed and protect hundreds of

374
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
thousands of individual customers

375
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
throughout the country or tens of

376
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
thousands of critical infrastructure

377
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
companies that rely upon

378
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
these cyber security and technology

379
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,160
companies uh so really the power of

380
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,519
coming together

381
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
is is astounding

382
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,320
but we're also bringing in the expertise

383
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
of other parts of the federal government

384
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,440
that have kind of unique domain

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,519
expertise in certain sectors so the

386
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
departments of energy and treasury and

387
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
health and human services and

388
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,399
transportation uh bringing their unique

389
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
subject matter expertise to the table as

390
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
we work through our cyber defense plans

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
it really enables us to be well

392
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
positioned to take the concrete actions

393
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,839
um because we've brought together the

394
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,120
right level of expertise in the

395
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
government uh whether it's on cyber

396
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
security whether it's on the the

397
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,680
individual sectors or whether it's um

398
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
the the the technology and cyber

399
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
security companies

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
um in addition to establishing the joint

401
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
cyber defense collaborative we also got

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
a host of new authorities in 2020 that

403
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
has enabled us uh to really increase our

404
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,560
understanding of the of the threat

405
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
landscape and take action more quickly

406
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
so for example being able to more

407
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,959
quickly identify uh the companies that

408
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
may have internet facing vulnerabilities

409
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
and work with them to to close those

410
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
down

411
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
expand our opportunities to provide

412
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
cybersecurity education and training

413
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
throughout the country to grow the

414
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
cybersecurity workforce

415
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
to establish a new cybersecurity

416
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
advisory committee to help us think

417
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
through what we are the challenges we're

418
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
facing today and to develop strategies

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
to ensure that we are well postured for

420
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,720
the future

421
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
um

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
but we've also been working to expand

423
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,680
our international collaboration as well

424
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,160
um and given the really dynamic global

425
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
threat environment and the threat

426
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,240
landscape that we face around the world

427
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
it is critical that the us government is

428
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
continuously developing and expanding

429
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,519
partnerships uh to ensure we have the

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,440
right insight into that threat

431
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
environment

432
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040
and an example of these partnerships uh

433
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
are with academic institutions such as

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
sirius and i know back in 2021 uh you

435
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
all worked uh working through the

436
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
department of state hosted several

437
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
workshops and cyber security challenge

438
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
weekends with cybersecurity uh critical

439
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
infrastructure professionals in ukraine

440
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
using open source information guidelines

441
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
best practices and those are exactly the

442
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
kinds of initiatives that we want to

443
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
foster in the united states and around

444
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
the world and it's why we're so

445
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
committed to working with foreign

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,000
partners to build out their capacity and

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,920
strengthen both our own ability and

448
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
their ability to support

449
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,480
our cyber security work and and critical

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
infrastructure resilience more more

451
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,199
generally um uh in 2021 we actually

452
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,839
released uh our first um

453
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
uh international strategy called cisa

454
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
global which outlines how we want to

455
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
work with our international partners to

456
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,680
fill our responsibilities execute our

457
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
work and create real unity of effort um

458
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
within these critical mission areas

459
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
we outlined kind of our our four main

460
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,519
goals things like advancing operational

461
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,399
cooperation

462
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
building partner capacity strengthening

463
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
collaboration through stakeholder

464
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,720
engagement and shaping the global policy

465
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
ecosystem that is so critical to the

466
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
development and maturation of cyber

467
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
security norms

468
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,160
and as part of that we've hosted a

469
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
series of exchanges with technical

470
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
experts around the world on a variety of

471
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
topics things from healthcare and

472
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,199
emerging technologies and medical

473
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,240
devices uh ransomware election security

474
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
miss and disinformation industrial

475
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
control systems

476
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,839
and and

477
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,199
those are really just the beginning and

478
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,040
a lot of that is based upon the demand

479
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
signal that we get from our

480
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
international partners uh where they're

481
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
seeing challenges and where they may

482
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,199
need assistance and where they want to

483
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,160
grow new capabilities in new capacity

484
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,079
obviously we also regularly communicate

485
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,759
and coordinate with

486
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
our closest allies the the u.s uh the

487
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
five eyes of australia canada new

488
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
zealand and the united kingdom um all

489
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,440
who have very similar cyber security

490
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
and critical infrastructure security

491
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
programs and allows us to share

492
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
information very quickly um we've also

493
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,639
continuously released joint cyber

494
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,399
security advisories with a number of our

495
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,000
five eye partners and actually in

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,720
december did our first ever all five

497
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
eyes joint sealed cyber security

498
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
advisory on on mitigating the

499
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
vulnerabilities associated with the log

500
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
for gel log4j library um

501
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
and uh we've actually started to embed

502
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
personnel uh uh globally in our in our

503
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
five eye partners cyber security

504
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,119
uh um agencies and and actually this

505
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,039
year we're deploying our first permanent

506
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
uh sisa attache uh in the united kingdom

507
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
to really build uh kind of lasting

508
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
relationships um in in europe um but it

509
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
also transcends down into the western

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
hemisphere cooperation with the

511
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,360
organization of of american states um

512
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
that has really been a cornerstone for

513
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,880
our regional engagement on cyber

514
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
security and and international uh

515
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,080
infrastructure security 5g

516
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,960
and and others

517
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,160
and

518
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
there's a number of places

519
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
where our work has been really unique

520
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
and a lot of that has to do with our

521
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
historic focus on building capacity and

522
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
industrial control systems

523
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
and the ability to understand how to

524
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
employ cyber security in these complex

525
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,480
industrial environments since it is such

526
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,200
a uh unique sphere and if there's a

527
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
workforce challenge in cybersecurity

528
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
generally it is even more compounded

529
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
when you think about cybersecurity and

530
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
industrial environments so we've done a

531
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
number of partnerships uh starting with

532
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
japan uh to provide ics training for

533
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
countries throughout the indo-pacific

534
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
region we've been doing that

535
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
actually back as far as 2017.

536
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
and

537
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,230
actually hosted our

538
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,360
[Music]

539
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
joint ics

540
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
committee that we formed with the

541
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,000
private sector

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
started bringing in a large number of

543
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
international uh partners to help

544
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,240
present that more uh unified global

545
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,919
picture and and really these are only

546
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,600
some of the examples of how we are

547
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
working to share threat innovation

548
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
information mitigation advice and best

549
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
practices with international partners um

550
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
uh around the world we really recognize

551
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
that making uh our partners more secure

552
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
has tremendous benefits for us uh for us

553
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
here in the homeland uh and i think as

554
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
hopefully uh your students can see um

555
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,919
there really are endless opportunities

556
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,720
uh for these efforts and and and today

557
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
the demands in this field have really

558
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
never been higher um i don't need to

559
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
cite to you that the statistics about

560
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
the number of unfilled cyber security

561
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
positions

562
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
around the world and here at home

563
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
needless to say it is it is significant

564
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
um and we here in the federal government

565
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
are always looking for uh new cyber

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
security talent uh and there's always uh

567
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,559
going to be a place for you here um so

568
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,480
we strongly encourage you to consider uh

571
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
continue to mature and develop our

572
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
capabilities

573
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,760

anything is really a problem-solving

586
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,280
field

587
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
it is not just a deep technical field we

588
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
need people who can solve problems and

589
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
there's

590
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,559
endless opportunities

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
connections

641
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
we have people here who've been working

642
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
in this field for

643
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,960
longer than you have and

644
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799

645
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,240
students uh we have affiliations with

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,919
uh

680
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
that's obviously a good question and and

681
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,000
one that the us government has grappled

682
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
with for a long time you know i joined

683
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
the department in the wake of

684
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,279
of uh not too long after 9 11 where kind

685
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,200
of the idea of bringing together

686
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
information to connect the dots so that

687
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
we don't miss the the

688
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
uh the warning signs of it of an

689
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,240
incident uh an impending threat or

690
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,000
incident um

691
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,159
uh and that problem has

692
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,000
persisted um

693
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,279
we're a big government we've got a lot

694
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
of information there's particularly when

695
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
you work in the in the in in the

696
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,440
classified realm there's uh a lot of

697
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,799
different challenges with sharing

698
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,200
information broadly uh i'd say that

699
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,559
there's there's a couple of different

700
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,799
things that we're doing first is

701
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,600
um

702
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,400
the relationship that we have developed

703
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
um amongst the kind of core cyber

704
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
security agencies so

705
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
um really us the fbi the national

706
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,799
security agency um again supported by

707
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,960
kind of some folks

708
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
a little bit you know on the periphery

709
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
of that like the dni and and uh cyber

710
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
command and others

711
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,400
um

712
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
have uh i think made great strides in

713
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
agreeing to to

714
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
more completely share information it's

715
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,679
why we've kind of pulled together this

716
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
joint cyber defense collaborative it's

717
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,799
um how we are trying to expose more data

718
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,000
to each other uh to enable rapid action

719
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
um all while kind of respecting uh

720
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,400
statutory limitations that have been

721
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
imposed on us whether for privacy or

722
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
civil liberty you know civil liberties

723
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,240
reasons um so we try to you know

724
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,799
carefully map that uh but you know i

725
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
think cisa is really in an information

726
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
sharing uh is in a position to advocate

727
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
for information sharing

728
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,279
both from our private sector partners as

729
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,200
well as from uh the government and that

730
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
only by kind of making that information

731
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
um uh more available can we actually put

732
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
the pieces together uh so i would say

733
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,320
you know the work that we are doing kind

734
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,200
of you know bilaterally and and jointly

735
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,080
with those agencies is making progress

736
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559
um we are actually working um even

737
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,919
without a congressional law full

738
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,840
authorization on this using our existing

739
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,360
authorities to put in place a joint

740
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,440
collaborative environment

741
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
both

742
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,919
an unclassified environment in a

743
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,080
classified environment where more cyber

744
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,159
security data can be

745
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,440
pulled together

746
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
to look for insights and to enable

747
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
operations uh so that work is is

748
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
literally underway now

749
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
taking information that we are we're

750
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
pulling in from telemetry across the

751
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
federal government with information

752
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
that's provided by the private sector

753
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
with information that uh we can um pull

754
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,679
in from from our federal interagency

755
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,279
partners so we're trying to make more of

756
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
that data available uh for use by

757
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,159
government analysts regardless of of

758
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
where they sit it's going to take us

759
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,080
time um it's going to take a willingness

760
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,200
upon all

761
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,279
of the agency partners to share that

762
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,520
information on an ongoing basis

763
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,279
but i think the more value we show the

764
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,960
more value we show to both our mission

765
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
and their mission uh the more likely

766
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
that we'll be able to sustain that type

767
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,200
of uh model

768
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,320
uh tommy gardner i'm a cto at hp uh

769
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
federal part of hp incorporated

770
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
and i wanted to uh you kind of answered

771
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,039
part of my question in your previous

772
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,000
answer

773
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
uh but

774
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
cyber security is all hands on deck

775
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,840
everybody's got to play a part everybody

776
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,360
uh needs to participate uh government

777
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
industry and academia and that's triyoka

778
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,320
is really critical in working together

779
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,919
uh what i'd ask you to go into more

780
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,399
detail of is how do you take your

781
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
relationship from the intelligence

782
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,720
community where a lot of what they're

783
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,799
doing is it highly classified from

784
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
sources and methods and the information

785
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
flow is very sensitively guarded and get

786
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,080
that out to the general public

787
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
particularly academia and industry most

788
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
of which don't have the clearances

789
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
needed to receive

790
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
all of that information

791
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,200
yep so and and that is something that we

792
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,279
are literally working on day in and day

793
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,200
out every single day which is how do we

794
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
take information that's coming from our

795
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
partners and that could be intelligence

796
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
community information uh that has we

797
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
need to protect sources and methods it

798
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,679
could be coming from the private sector

799
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,440
and we need to protect

800
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,159
the identity of of victims or you know

801
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,760
or protect the privacy rights of

802
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,200
individuals who are providing us this

803
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
information

804
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
and so we work extremely hard to say

805
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,159
what is the core information that the

806
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,600
network defense community in this

807
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
country needs to be able to make the

808
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
improvements inside of their networks to

809
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
make them more secure and resilient and

810
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,760
oftentimes that does not require

811
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,559
the full breadth of of information that

812
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,840
coming from the intelligence community

813
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,159
it requires kind of bits and pieces of

814
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,279
it

815
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,279
but what i would say is that almost

816
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
every single cyber security advisory

817
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
that the government has released

818
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
over the past

819
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,840
several years but especially over the

820
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
past

821
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,440
year

822
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,000
has contained significant amounts of

823
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
formally classified information or

824
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,320
information that was provided to us

825
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,360
with

826
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
certain protections around it from uh

827
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,240
from the private sector uh or from

828
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
incident response activities that uh our

829
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
hunt and incident response uh team

830
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
members kind of collected so um we are

831
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
we are making that happen it's not

832
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,679
always uh we don't advertise that fact

833
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,039
it's not always apparent in every single

834
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,600
document that this is often gleaned from

835
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
uh insights gathered from intelligence

836
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
collection uh because we want to make

837
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,159
sure really that we are honing in on

838
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,240
only the parts that that are really most

839
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
critical now that being said we often do

840
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,840
want to provide members of the private

841
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,960
sector um a better context about what

842
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,799
they're doing so they can hunt for the

843
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,159
right types of tactics and they're

844
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,679
knowing what the adversary is looking to

845
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,720
achieve

846
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,480
so we have kind of we do sponsor

847
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,240
clearances for the private sector and as

848
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
i said as part of our russia ukraine

849
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
outreach campaign

850
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
literally have done

851
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,880
um

852
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,120
probably 20 or 30 classified briefings

853
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,279
for the private sector have hit

854
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,600
hundreds if not you know low thousands

855
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
of individuals

856
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
at a classified level providing them

857
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
more detail on what we know

858
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,720
what specific

859
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
russian intelligence service cyber

860
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,799
actors are are doing what

861
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,640
what their specific goals and aims might

862
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
be what tactics they're using

863
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
that way when they see the unclassified

864
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
they see the public advisories

865
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,240
they have more context they understand

866
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
where that's coming from and actually

867
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
then they could also be

868
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,919
a powerful voice in amplifying that

869
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,799
information um within their communities

870
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,720
and so we try to take a multi-pronged

871
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,080
approach at this

872
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
but it is definitely something that

873
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
requires kind of constant work and

874
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,279
attention uh we're not able to always

875
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,640
get all the information we need

876
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,799
downgraded but we've had had great

877
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,200
success um in pushing out a lot more

878
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
information at the unclassified public

879
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,159
level

880
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,919
to enable enhance cyber security

881
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,799
good morning my name is jim larum some

882
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,559
graduate faculty here at purdue as well

883
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,600
as

884
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,120
a serious scholar uh what type of phd

885
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,840
positions are you looking at filling at

886
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
cisa

887
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,880
so the truth is um there's there's no

888
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
one kind i mean obviously folks who have

889
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
kind of deeper technical expertise in in

890
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,159
relevant fields in in computer science

891
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
and in in um

892
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,679
you know artificial intelligence and

893
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
machine learning those are there there's

894
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
obviously a place uh

895
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
here for that type of

896
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,519
technical background

897
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,240
but

898
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,799
we have a wide variety of positions that

899
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,159
are going to work and support the cyber

900
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,760
security community

901
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,840
you know we have people who work on

902
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,279
outreach and engagement building

903
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,440
partnerships with the private sector

904
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,000
we have people who are working on on

905
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,480
building and doing technical reference

906
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
architectures for our next generation

907
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,000
detection platforms

908
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
we have people who are working on policy

909
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,120
and strategy

910
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,440
and really so there is nearly an endless

911
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,039
number of people who will be directly

912
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,440
involved in the cyber security work um

913
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,679
and it doesn't require someone who can

914
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,320
uh code in five languages and and write

915
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
their own snort rules in their spare

916
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,200
time

917
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,279
we are really looking for kind of all

918
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,080
hands on deck uh and uh frankly a lot of

919
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
the work uh if you're smart and you're

920
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,880
eager um a lot of the the

921
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,679
the basics uh we can teach you and

922
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,000
the kind of on-the-job training can be

923
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,360
really uh tremendous so um encourage

924
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,919
folks to to apply and and undoubtedly

925
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,240
there'll be a place for you here

926
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
thank you

927
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,080
good morning i'm joe mata i have a

928
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
startup that's based in austin and also

929
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,760
in dc we're advancing patented counter

930
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,480
threat network uh software what is the

931
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,039
best place for the point of injection

932
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,039
for consideration of innovative

933
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,120
disruptive software within this

934
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,840
community in the space

935
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,840
um you mean for the federal government

936
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
or you just mean generally you know

937
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
where do we where are we

938
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
seeing kind of next generation problems

939
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,039
and and

940
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,200
um

941
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,840
solutions so so right so for cross

942
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
domain solutions all of the issues that

943
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
you've touched upon that are very

944
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
relevant and emerging um where is the

945
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
best place for startups to present that

946
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
in innovative companies to submit that

947
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,000
for consideration

948
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
yeah so that's that's good and we can

949
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,159
provide uh

950
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,519
to the serious team and get you some

951
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
information about um how to provide

952
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,720
information uh to us i'd say that we

953
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,799
work in kind of two different venues

954
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,399
kind of directly one is

955
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,600
we kind of

956
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,279
we get a lot of obviously solicitations

957
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
about new and innovative ideas and in

958
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,159
cyber security um we try to pull those

959
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,000
together and then um

960
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
uh

961
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
have sessions where we have folks come

962
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,919
in and brief the entire team

963
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,519
we do that to protect ourselves and to

964
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,440
protect the vendors because of kind of

965
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
procurement rules we want to make sure

966
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,159
that we don't

967
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,760
do things inappropriate and actually end

968
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
up excluding people from being able to

969
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
compete for certain

970
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
contracts down the road

971
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,559
so we've got fairly a fairly structured

972
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,600
process by which we can um take in that

973
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
information and have folks come in and

974
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,519
demonstrate the the the kind of new

975
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,880
innovative thinking

976
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
but in addition we have a close

977
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,399
partnership with the office of science

978
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,599
and technology at the department of

979
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,639
homeland security um where we've kind of

980
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
go through kind of a list of priority

981
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
areas where we think we need

982
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
new and innovative thinking and they put

983
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,760
out kind of broad research uh grants to

984
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,599
both academic and and private sector

985
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,679
institutions and kind of look for

986
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
um budding talent they have some kind of

987
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,960
unique procurement authorities that

988
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,639
allow them to kind of tap into that

989
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,000
community and access it a little bit

990
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,440
more quickly

991
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
so we try to use a variety of different

992
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
tools and and processes but we can

993
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,320
certainly get you more information about

994
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,159
how to

995
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,359
get into get into that process for us

996
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,918
very good thank you

997
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,320
hi mr whales my name is uh michael

998
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
reeves i'm from san diego national labs

999
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,800
i work in cyber security initiatives

1000
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,359
research and development uh and so my

1001
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,119
question is kind of different from a lot

1002
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,320
of the other ones that i've come up

1003
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,359
today uh i know the federal government

1004
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,880
over the years has started up many

1005
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,560
different cyber security initiatives

1006
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,320
that focus on

1007
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,400
various pieces of federal government

1008
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
infrastructure that

1009
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
helps uh secure and protect the nation

1010
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
and so

1011
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
underneath uh sister right now uh there

1012
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,440
are eight or so different programs that

1013
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
all deal with different pieces of

1014
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,200
federal infrastructure are there plans

1015
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,720
in sisa

1016
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,400
to tie these pieces together and make

1017
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,680
them all work together because right now

1018
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,800
they're all very separate and they don't

1019
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
really talk together

1020
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,119
so

1021
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,560
there's one issue there and then the

1022
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
second thing is uh

1023
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,560
cis are working on their own initiatives

1024
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
to create pipelines to help

1025
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,760
communication and collaboration across

1026
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,480
these different efforts

1027
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
uh sure no so it's it is

1028
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
it is a good

1029
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
point and it's a good question and we

1030
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
are taking a hard look over the past

1031
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
um

1032
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
18 months at our

1033
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,839
uh

1034
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
architecture for protecting the the

1035
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
federal civilian executive branch and

1036
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
the the tools and systems that we

1037
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,119
uh that we utilize um

1038
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
so you know obviously a number of these

1039
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
different programs kind of serve

1040
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,920
different purposes uh but with the

1041
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,000
ultimate goal of of strengthening our

1042
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,640
cyber security um we have we are now

1043
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
looking at ways in which as you noted to

1044
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,119
kind of make sure that these are able to

1045
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
be integrated in a more cohesive way

1046
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,560
um so that the two

1047
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,880
flagship programs for a long time at the

1048
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
at the macro level for our for our

1049
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,680
federal uh cyber security have been the

1050
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,200
what's called the einstein program which

1051
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,520
is actually somewhat of a misnomer

1052
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
because it contains a variety of kind of

1053
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,599
different types of capabilities

1054
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,920
and our continuous diagnostics and

1055
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,599
mitigation program which really is a

1056
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,079
vehicle to provide agencies with um

1057
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,000
technology that enables them to do

1058
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
different types of of it operations

1059
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,760
whether it's asset management and

1060
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,440
software management or

1061
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
patch management inside of their

1062
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,079
networks

1063
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,240
what we are doing uh and thanks to

1064
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
congress by providing us some additional

1065
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,000
authorities at the beginning of 2020 and

1066
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,839
some additional funding as part of the

1067
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
american rescue plan act um in in early

1068
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,160
uh

1069
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
2021

1070
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,359
um we are able to kind of jump start um

1071
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,200
an effort to kind of pull these together

1072
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
in what we call our mission systems

1073
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,040
engineering environment uh part of this

1074
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,640
uh required us to be able to actually

1075
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,040
gain access to all the continuous

1076
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,200
diagnostics and mitigation data uh

1077
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
previously we were only able to get very

1078
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
limited summary data and agencies

1079
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
themselves kept the detailed object

1080
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
level data

1081
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
which would prevent us from being able

1082
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
to kind of correlate uh threat

1083
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
information that we are seeing at the

1084
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
boundary with information that's

1085
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,960
happening inside of federal agency

1086
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
networks

1087
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,119
we've now kind of under the executive

1088
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,640
order and using some authorities that

1089
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
the congress provided able to kind of

1090
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,440
gain access to object level data

1091
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
um so now we are working automation and

1092
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,000
kind of meaningful at the same time

1093
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,200
through the american rescue plan act we

1094
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
are kind of moving away from a heavy

1095
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
focus on boundary level uh security into

1096
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,800
the interior with you know um

1097
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
uh endpoint detection and response uh

1098
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
tooling and sensing technologies that

1099
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
we're deploying more consistently

1100
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
throughout the federal agencies now

1101
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,480
again we probably are never going to be

1102
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,839
in a position where we are fully

1103
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,800
ingesting the full pipe of every edr uh

1104
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,040
endpoint of every federal agency given

1105
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,520
the millions of endpoints that exist

1106
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
throughout the federal government um but

1107
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,520
our goal is to have that information

1108
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,119
kind of stored

1109
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,079
at a a designated point inside of an

1110
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,480
agency with the ability for cisa to kind

1111
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,760
of tap into that uh net that store

1112
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,480
um run analytics on it and then pull

1113
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,800
back data that we actually need into our

1114
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
environment and so we are

1115
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,160
at the same time we have to do the same

1116
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
thing in cloud you know agency cloud

1117
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,599
environments that don't necessarily

1118
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
accept the same type of sensing and

1119
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,960
tooling technology so

1120
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,119
um we are we're working in this

1121
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,640
environment to be able to kind of create

1122
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,880
an analytic uh platform that can tie

1123
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
into these different tools without

1124
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,640
having to create the mother of all

1125
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
databases

1126
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,880
that would be both a massive target and

1127
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,920
probably impossible to administer um so

1128
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
in some respects this is an incredibly

1129
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,520
challenging problem given the the

1130
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,359
diversity of technology that we're going

1131
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,480
to be dealing with

1132
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
um so we are we're doing a variety of

1133
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,760
things that are probably going to get

1134
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,359
way too in the weeds in terms of putting

1135
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,760
on small overlays on top of everyone's

1136
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,839
edr platform to take out kind of a

1137
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,000
subset of data so that we can

1138
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
use that more efficiently across

1139
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,599
different types of edr technologies

1140
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,839
whether they're using crowdstrike falcon

1141
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,640
or they're using um palo alto xdr i mean

1142
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,000
there's there's different platforms and

1143
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,119
we want to be able to take a kind of

1144
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,760
core set of data from all of them to be

1145
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
able to run analytics in a consistent uh

1146
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
consistent way across this environment

1147
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,000
inside of this new mission systems

1148
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,320
engineering environment the network is

1149
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,040
literally underway right now that system

1150
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
will probably be

1151
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,760
at least partially up and running at an

1152
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,680
initial operating capability early next

1153
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
year

1154
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
taking initial streams of data but we're

1155
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
actually piloting the actual underlying

1156
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,119
technology work um and the underlying

1157
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,560
kind of data

1158
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,640
architecture this year in a handful of

1159
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,440
federal agencies now so

1160
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,040
i think we're making progress the

1161
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
biggest challenge uh really is the

1162
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,359
government scale um and the ability to

1163
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,440
kind of get consistency at scale when

1164
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
you think about the fact that there are

1165
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,040
actually 101 federalist civilian

1166
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
executive branch agencies all with their

1167
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,400
own unique authority

1168
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
uh and responsibility for their i.t and

1169
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,760
and and cyber security uh and so and

1170
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
then when you go to some large agency

1171
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,480
like like a nasa or dhs or department of

1172
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,640
justice and you have all the sub-cabinet

1173
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,359
agencies and bureaus et cetera who all

1174
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,800
are kind of

1175
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,440
masters of their own fiefdom uh it you

1176
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,359
know it complicates this problem either

1177
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,040
even further and so we've been spending

1178
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
a lot of time kind of building

1179
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,839
uh the relationships necessary for us to

1180
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,640
kind of create a more cohesive

1181
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,560
architecture on the technical side

1182
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,800
because in many respects the policy and

1183
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
relationship challenges make the

1184
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,640
technology challenges uh pale by

1185
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,079
comparison

1186
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,560
but i do think that uh solarwinds was

1187
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,480
somewhat of a game changer both in kind

1188
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,640
of creating momentum at the federal

1189
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
level in terms of new authorities

1190
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,560
direction from the white house resources

1191
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,119
for cisa to enable us to kind of put in

1192
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,040
place what we think will be a more kind

1193
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
of modern architecture to allow us to

1194
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,240
hunt uh consistently and persistently in

1195
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,720
federal networks um and to do so in a

1196
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,240
more

1197
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,480
consistent way with better access

1198
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,800
to detailed object level data in those

1199
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
networks i'm sorry that was a long

1200
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,960
question but that long answer that was a

1201
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,280
uh kind of a complicated uh deep deep

1202
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
question that that really

1203
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,160
um is one of significant focus area uh

1204
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
inside of this agency

1205
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,520
yeah that's uh that was perfect thank

1206
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,839
you

1207
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
i realize that uh

1208
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
you your time is uh limited with us

1209
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,880
today um we we seem to have gone through

1210
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
the questions in the audience i did have

1211
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,440
one thing that i wanted to ask um if you

1212
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
have comments sure thing uh over the

1213
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
last couple of years uh we've had

1214
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,680
keynote uh uh talks from chris english

1215
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,040
and rob joyce

1216
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
and uh conversations with them they're

1217
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,000
they're longtime friends of the center

1218
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and

1219
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,119
cisa

1220
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,040
and many initiatives

1221
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,760
and other agencies have been focused on

1222
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,079
detection and response

1223
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,319
faster patching faster identification

1224
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,920
capture of information to look for

1225
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,520
intrusions

1226
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,440
with very little done to try to

1227
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,359
prevent those things in the first place

1228
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,160
by having better software better

1229
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,760
architectures uh better organization we

1230
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,839
continue to build on broken legacy

1231
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,960
systems

1232
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,000
and

1233
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,480
act like we're surprised when something

1234
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,520
happens

1235
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,200
so um right now it's a very high tempo

1236
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,599
environment for for

1237
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,920
uh but are there plans to do something

1238
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,480
to actually help change

1239
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,119
the ecosystem so that we aren't

1240
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,520
continually uh depending on these broken

1241
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
legacy platforms

1242
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,200
now it's it's it's an excellent question

1243
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,920
and um it's one that featured very

1244
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,839
prominently in the

1245
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,400
uh executive order signed by president

1246
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,839
biden uh last may in terms of how do we

1247
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,280
move to an environment of uh more secure

1248
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,400
software um

1249
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,800
development uh up front

1250
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,560
so i would say that there's kind of

1251
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,520
let's cover two pieces here um the first

1252
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,400
is

1253
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,640
uh we are working very closely with nist

1254
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,720
who is kind of taken leadership

1255
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,319
on this issue

1256
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,240
to put in place what are the you know

1257
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,920
using their standard processes about

1258
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,440
kind of creating standards for

1259
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
secure software development um we're

1260
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,760
working closely with them on that as

1261
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,440
they can kind of continue to build that

1262
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,079
out uh second we are uh working to kind

1263
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,599
of use the power of the federal

1264
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,680
government's purchasing uh to kind of

1265
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,200
help move the community in this

1266
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,640
direction so

1267
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,520
um we are working with the the council

1268
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,160
that manages uh the federal acquisition

1269
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,000
regulations so all the rules governing

1270
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,599
how the federal government buys and

1271
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,240
procures um anything

1272
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,680
to ensure that

1273
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,920
there are new rules in place that the us

1274
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,400
government will require uh secure

1275
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,920
software development before it will

1276
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,800
purchase uh software in the future

1277
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
um and we think that that could result

1278
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,119
in kind of a sea change as companies are

1279
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,560
not gonna obviously have two development

1280
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
platforms and if they develop it

1281
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,839
securely for the federal government it

1282
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,520
will have follow-on effects for the

1283
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,839
broader community um we're obviously

1284
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,280
also working on a number of kind of

1285
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,920
tangential and related uh issues where

1286
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,359
we have more of a leadership role

1287
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,200
including you know concepts like a

1288
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,359
software bill of materials recognizing

1289
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,359
that that is not um necessarily

1290
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,880
prevention up front but allows kind of

1291
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,359
faster mitigation on the back end uh as

1292
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,280
you can identify if there are components

1293
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
uh that that have uh potential

1294
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,760
vulnerabilities in them down the road

1295
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,280
but we all think that this is part of an

1296
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,839
effort to kind of push on the secure

1297
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,400
software development side i think the

1298
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
aftermath of the log for shell

1299
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,920
vulnerability

1300
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,839
and the push on what we can do to make

1301
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,560
open source software more secure

1302
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,920
both from the federal government as well

1303
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,280
as kind of big

1304
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,880
tech companies who are willing to kind

1305
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,240
of invest with their own money and

1306
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,160
resources and helping

1307
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,599
could

1308
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,160
again i think help this problem uh but

1309
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,720
it is it is a challenging one um and

1310
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
it's not one where there i think it

1311
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
there are kind of easy answers where

1312
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,720
we've we've got them um uh it is one

1313
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,839
that's going to require multiple

1314
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,119
different parts of the fellow government

1315
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,640
working closely together i know chris

1316
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,560
inglis he and i have talked about this

1317
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,640
uh specific problem and it's one of the

1318
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,839
areas that i think he's going to have

1319
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,440
the national cyber director's office

1320
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,839
focus a bit more attention on uh as it

1321
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,480
is a place where there um appears to be

1322
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,680
a gap

1323
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
in the federal government's ability to

1324
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,599
kind of take action at the scale and

1325
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,560
speed necessary to to have an impact um

1326
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
but certainly if there are you know

1327
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,599
ideas uh out there on how we can uh more

1328
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,920
effectively address this if there are

1329
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,440
authorities and tools the federal

1330
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,359
government can bring to bear to to

1331
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,680
assist uh would really love kind of

1332
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,240
innovative thinking um from from places

1333
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,040
like yours to kind of help us uh go in

1334
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,680
the right direction

1335
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,640
thank you very much and

1336
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,960
um thank you for both the commitment to

1337
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,240
uh our our shared and mutual security

1338
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,000
and uh for

1339
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,400
willing to take the time out to speak to

1340
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
us today uh we very much appreciate it

1341
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,480
we hope you can come visit in person

1342
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,839
sometime

1343
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,760
next year is our 25th anniversary of the

1344
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,119
center we're going to have a lot of

1345
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,040
