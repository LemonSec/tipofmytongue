so um today i'm going to take you on a

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,159
little

55
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,160
journey um

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,119
um

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
regarding the cyber security assurance

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
and policy center so

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
um

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,239
okay there we go

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,480
so where i'll give you an overview um

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
from a historical perspective

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
and then i'll dive uh do a

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
cursory dive

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
into the type of research

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,440
we all highlight

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
to

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
at least two specific projects

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
to

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
give you some perspective on the breadth

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
of the type of research that we do

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,920
i'll talk a little bit about our

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
academic programs and

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,679
conclude with us

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
some

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
ideas about how we

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
do workforce development so

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
our journey began in 2014 with an nsf

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,800
rise grant so when i arrived at

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
morgan

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
it didn't give out starter packages or

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
anything so

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
before i could

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
get graduate students and build research

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
infrastructure

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
i needed money so i wrote an nsf rise

87
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
grant which is a

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
research

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
instrumentation

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
in science and engineering uh grant so

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
it's really for

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
um

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
to build up um

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
uh capac help you build up capacity and

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,879
infrastructure

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
um in

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
synonymous with that i

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,959
founded the

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
cream lab uh which is the first lab

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,799
that's just now been subsumed by the

101
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,080
the cap center but the cream lab

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
cream stands for the

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,200
center for reverse engineering and

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,439
assured microelectronics

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
um

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
then we started to branch out and and

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
develop partnerships

108
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,519
particularly with the

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
folks in the intelligence community so

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
we had a

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,399
pilot program at the national

112
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,240
um security agency in 2016

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
and what followed after that also well

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
actually that same year

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
we became an nsa center for academic

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,199
excellence in cyber defense education

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
uh we launched subsequent to that we

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
launched a

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
masters of engineering and cyber

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
engineering

121
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,880
program in 2017 which is a

122
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
civilian navy civilian program where

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
they send a cohort here for a year and

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,680
they get

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,639
you know

126
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
the program is a

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
information assurance focused

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
um curriculum uh

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,360
and then in 2018 with us funds from

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
the state of maryland we became the uh

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
the subsecurity assurance and policy

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,039
center

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,479
and we've grown

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,600
from a

135
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
2 000 square foot laboratory to two

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,039
floors

137
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
in a building so

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
um

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
as i mentioned we're cae we were just

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
redesignated and uh

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,479
um

142
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,960
uh this actually um

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
earlier this year

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
and we plan to

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,840
become a cae or submit our designation

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,199
um

147
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,759
in this fall

148
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,280
our mission

149
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
is effectively to provide the

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
intelligence community with knowledge

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
methodology methodology solutions and

152
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
highly skilled cyber security workforce

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
to

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
help

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
prevent the penetration and manipulation

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
of our nation's cyber physical

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
infrastructure so because we live in a

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
society where everything's connected to

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
everything

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
and and

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
we have these

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,199
at the you know from the edge to the

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
cloud you have a variety of smart

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
devices

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
you know homes hospitals etc

166
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
and

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,759
but at the very

168
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,080
heart of these

169
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
devices or embedded systems

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
so

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
so effectively the

172
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
the everything today if you think of

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
about a tesla

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
it's just a collection of

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,190
um

176
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,400
[Music]

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
electronic control units which are

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
embedded systems it may have with a

179
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,599
tesla may have over 300 of these devices

180
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,560
and

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
it's just a mobile iot platform

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,479
and so

183
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,919
we use invasive and non-invasive

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
mostly non-invasive techniques

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
of both on the hardware side and

186
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
software side to

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
assess the assurance of these embedded

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
systems

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
so

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
uh research

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,520
you'll see

192
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,199
in the following slides how we

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,440
we integrate that into

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
our instruction as well as our research

195
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,199
and how that

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
tightly coupled um

197
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,000
is our faculty

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
um the university graduated from so

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,160
this we are center

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
um and these are

201
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,759
the faculty are hard well actually

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
they are um they receive a reduced

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
teaching load so that they can conduct

204
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,160
research

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
exclusively being exclusively in the

206
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,599
center so they

207
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,879
um the primary goal is to research

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
although they are

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
affiliated with uh

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
an academic unit or department so

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
um

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
we have affiliate faculty who are not

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
supported by the um

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,800
by the center

215
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
meaning their salaries and all but

216
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,080
they're

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,878
they come from other

218
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,680
places on campus

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,240
including the school of business and the

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
school of mathematics

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
computing and natural sciences that we

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
our staff we have

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,080
post docs visiting scientists and

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,560
faculty

225
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,240
we consider ourselves uh subject matter

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,679
experts

227
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
in um secure embedded systems hardware

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
reverse engineering

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
software reverse engineering hardware

230
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,880
security

231
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
uh ai and machine learning

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,200
from the

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
um

234
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
we're concerned about the algorithms and

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,880
and

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
the trustworthiness of the algorithms

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,279
from that perspective

238
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
and

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,560
also as it pertains to secure autonomy

240
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
so

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
um

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,399
funding sparks we have

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,640
funding and sponsors and

244
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
we have tons of park academic park

245
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
collaborators uh

246
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
so we we have funds from the national

247
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,920
security agency national science

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
foundation

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
sandia national labs

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
so we

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
we have

252
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
federal agencies we have

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
university applied research centers that

254
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
will affiliate within federally funded

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,120
research

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
and development centers

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,279
and this

258
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,920
uh includes nist and

259
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
miter

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
various companies uh and so forth um and

261
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
universities uh including

262
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,959
um purdue and that's growing um we just

263
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,480
working with several faculty

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
collaborating on

265
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,079
recently a recent collaboration on a

266
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
grant proposal and just received an

267
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
invitation for another so

268
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,760
um so

269
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
back to now uh

270
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
talk a little bit about our research

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
and there's a lot of

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
talk about

273
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
zero trust and

274
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
and um

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
and one thing i want to say about zero

276
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,839
trust it's not a technology

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,120
it's really a

278
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
set of policies and

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
a way of thought

280
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
um but in

281
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
as far as how you is where you establish

282
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,959
your

283
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,320
um

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
your security

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
perimeter in a traditional setting

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
um

287
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
they established a single

288
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
perimeter all the way around

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
the

290
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,079
all the way around the enterprise

291
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
and um

292
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
this as we've seen

293
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
the three you know they use a firewall

294
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,480
to prevent

295
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
threats

296
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,800
um

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
but today

298
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
where most networks

299
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
are the software use software-defined

300
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
networking technology

301
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,200
um in a zero trust defense it focuses

302
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,800
really on resource protection so they

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
bring

304
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
the implicit trust zone

305
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
is closer or directed at the actual

306
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
resource

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
um

308
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,279
itself so

309
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
where the

310
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
the onus is you don't trust anyone

311
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
okay that's the basic idea

312
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
and there's a lot of attack attestation

313
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
that goes on

314
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
and you you just

315
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
effectively you don't trust

316
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
any device or anyone so

317
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,880
and uh it has this pros and cons but

318
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,920
really is

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,800
it's just a strategy that leverages

320
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,160
really policy issues and to prevent data

321
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
breaches

322
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
but as i stated earlier it is not a

323
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
technology or product

324
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,279
it does not

325
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
it also does not mean you're making the

326
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
system more trusted it's just

327
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
a different way of

328
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
protecting your system

329
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
okay

330
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
does have some challenges and

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
particularly

332
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
uh

333
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,519
today

334
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,720
and it's

335
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
all everything connected to everything

336
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
in my world that we live in

337
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,120
um these iot the devices in particular

338
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
billions and billions and as the cities

339
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
become more

340
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
inundated with these devices

341
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
and you know they permeate every aspect

342
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
of our daily lives so

343
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
there isn't uh

344
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
a moment in the day where we don't

345
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,600
interact with some kind of iot device so

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,880
um

347
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,160
uh

348
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
so

349
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,920
these uh i they present challenges

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,800
and um

351
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,200
and these devices are

352
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
are constrained

353
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
resource constrained in terms of

354
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
uh computation in terms of storage so

355
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
forth so

356
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,880
um and they

357
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
don't they lack uh any kind of most of

358
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,360
them lack any kind of to develop without

359
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
security in mind so

360
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,079
um

361
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,120
and then

362
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,519
so how do you

363
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,120
um

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
in the zero trust framework

365
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
how do you

366
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,639
um

367
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,680
address

368
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
um

369
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,839
you know you have time to access time

370
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,000
resources

371
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
when you have to

372
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
move the implicit trust

373
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,880
region to the actual resource

374
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
this

375
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
heterogeneity

376
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,959
presents a

377
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,560
challenge

378
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
and as well as legacy

379
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
uh technology you have

380
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,000
you know

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
for example an old camera that's been on

382
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
your system that hasn't been patched

383
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
in for years but it still exists and

384
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
you've forgotten about it

385
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
that devices

386
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
hackers are very skillful

387
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,800
very smart so they exploit

388
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,479
all these types of weaknesses so

389
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,959
um we

390
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,639
created

391
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
uh our laboratory environment um

392
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
is an experimental framework that we

393
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,040
developed

394
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
and um

395
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
beginning with the cap net which is a

396
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
zero trust social defined net power so

397
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,639
defined networking environment

398
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,079
we were able to accomplish this

399
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,839
um

400
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
because we have our own data line coming

401
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,959
in and we're totally

402
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
independent of the university's id

403
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
infrastructure

404
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
so that gives us a lot of flexibility to

405
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,440
do

406
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,279
all kinds of neat things so

407
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
so we have uh

408
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
this testbed framework we have these

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,320
common interfaces but

410
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
what we have

411
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
each of these frameworks uh we have

412
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
sensors where we can

413
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,519
collect data and so forth and each of

414
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,480
these it spans across different

415
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
different

416
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,079
sectors such as the home automation

417
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,160
smart building smart grid

418
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,759
and we have literally hundreds of

419
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,120
devices

420
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
and these are real world devices um

421
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,399
and so we want to create this

422
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,320
heterogeneity so we can then

423
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
um

424
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,040
we can

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
then look at the

426
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,680
attack surface and and see where the

427
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
threats are

428
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,199
in addition to that we have the

429
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,240
sensitive

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
networks that

431
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,600
include the

432
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,839
narrowband iot laura zbd's and bluetooth

433
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,959
um

434
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
we have our cloud off to the right we

435
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,759
have our own data center

436
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
and uh

437
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
the connectivity

438
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,000
we've just uh we're not planning to

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
integrate

440
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
a 5g

441
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,320
testbed and

442
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
we just purchased so

443
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,279
with this what this does it presents for

444
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,639
the

445
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,599
student reason for our

446
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
student researchers our graduate

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,000
students and undergraduate students

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
they

449
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
are they we present them with a

450
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
it is uh

451
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
this presents a virtually flat

452
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,559
or horizontal attack surface so you

453
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,839
don't know where the attacks are going

454
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,959
to come from

455
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,439
so we look at so we assessed

456
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,200
and our goal is to provide security and

457
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
depth from the edge to the cloud

458
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
so our philosophy regarding our strategy

459
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,360
is

460
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
to

461
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,840
treat uh security

462
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,000
um uh at like an onion so

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
so where we have

464
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
because there's no single bullet that

465
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
too that handles uh dresses everything

466
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
so

467
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
so the first project i'm going to talk

468
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
about is uh

469
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
addresses deals with uh

470
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
various types of attacks

471
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
on on the you know from the ascension

472
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
network side

473
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
um you can imagine

474
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,919
uh

475
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,840
you

476
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,480
have

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
you have trash oh you've seen them you

478
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
probably

479
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
go in a parking lot you have these uh

480
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
sensors that let you know

481
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,320
if there's a space available and so

482
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
forth and uh

483
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
um

484
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
someone can wreak havoc

485
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
of course you can visually see if a

486
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,799
spacer but um

487
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,240
these networks are everywhere so

488
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
um

489
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
and again

490
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,360
the objective is to evaluate and assess

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
um the

492
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,480
vulnerabilities and um

493
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,280
to

494
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
really answer the

495
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
question what types of threats do iot

496
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,799
devices pose

497
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,160
to 5g

498
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,679
so can you

499
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,160
effectively

500
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
enact a denial of service

501
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,679
attack on a 5g

502
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,120
network

503
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,760
um from the edge so those are the types

504
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,320
of things

505
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
and

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
given our

507
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,039
infrastructure research infrastructure

508
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,799
um

509
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,840
and

510
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
on the one side of the spectrum you have

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
iot devices that have

512
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
that are power

513
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
and um

514
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
uh

515
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
computationally

516
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
constrained

517
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,600
and

518
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,559
and

519
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,880
storage constraints so

520
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,080
um

521
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,840
and they don't have any features but can

522
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you leverage that

523
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
and and we're looking at really

524
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,600
the convergence of iot 5g and ai can you

525
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,480
leverage that to

526
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
enhance provide

527
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,880
enhanced security

528
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,240
and where you're taking advantage of the

529
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,000
on the cloud side

530
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
that you have limited power you have

531
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
high computing

532
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
and you have lots of

533
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,919
resources

534
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,000
and tools so

535
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
um

536
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
we set out to

537
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,799
um

538
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,799
develop this so

539
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,840
uh

540
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
we we do a lot of we're very hardware

541
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
intensive

542
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
and um

543
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
and and i'll talk a little bit later

544
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
about our

545
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,919
secure better

546
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
systems phd program

547
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,919
where we uh

548
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,840
we have courses that are designed to

549
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
help students

550
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
uh impart to is designed and developed

551
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
to impart the requisite skills necessary

552
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
to

553
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
um

554
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,480
address

555
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
to work in the space so

556
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,640
um

557
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
what we have to do

558
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,919
you know our infrastructure and our test

559
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,080
beds require

560
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
uh lots of development time so

561
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
um

562
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
we are

563
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,919
leveraging on the cloud side aws has

564
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,960
this nice suite of tools that you can

565
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,799
uh leverage and fit in particular visual

566
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,000
visualization tools

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,679
um so we just built out uh several

568
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,880
um

569
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
uh

570
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
test beds that uh and spread them across

571
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
the different uh

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,840
rooms in the uh building

573
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
um

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,480
but here we can have take advantage of

575
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
full ended in access

576
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
and we can do this remotely and this was

577
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,200
particularly useful

578
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,159
in um during covet

579
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
but as a matter of fact our

580
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,440
collaborators who want to

581
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
work with us and they want to collect

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,919
data

583
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,760
uh they could they don't have to

584
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,480
physically be in the lab

585
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,159
uh and so

586
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,120
this laid the groundwork for

587
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,159
um a framework

588
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,559
uh additionally you need some additional

589
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,520
tools

590
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,840
um

591
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
to perform the

592
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,400
[Music]

593
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
the various types of attacks

594
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
um

595
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
so

596
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
we're concerned with the

597
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,559
the infrastructure that i showed you

598
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
earlier

599
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
um

600
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
we're really concerned about

601
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,559
the types of attacks that we're

602
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,360
concerned about or asymmetric attacks

603
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,559
where

604
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,000
folks use

605
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,120
low or cheap in technology but the

606
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
the end result is is profound they want

607
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
the striking so it brings the system

608
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,320
down

609
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,640
um so uh there's plenty of there's lots

610
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
of tools out there for hacking

611
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,679
um particularly in the in the wireless

612
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,799
domain

613
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
there's software defined radios uh

614
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
there's hack rf1 there's lots of cheap

615
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,919
these things are cheap

616
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,679
uh there's uh

617
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,720
there's a

618
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,600
to to configure them use gnu radio which

619
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
is

620
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,480
available open source is free

621
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
um there's lots of

622
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,919
packet analyzers and so forth so so with

623
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,960
these

624
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
inexpensive tools

625
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
and hardware you can

626
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,840
perform all types of tax attacks such as

627
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,120
eavesdropping replay

628
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
jamming and

629
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,240
you know you can also alter the data so

630
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
um

631
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
so we set out to develop a low-cost

632
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,840
jammer

633
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,960
um and

634
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
i'll just

635
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
um

636
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
so

637
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
after we built the hardware to develop

638
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
the framework

639
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,279
um

640
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
we wanted to see how the next question

641
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,080
is how can we leverage machine learning

642
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
to

643
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,279
um

644
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,799
to um

645
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
in to develop a counter measure

646
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,279
to uh

647
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,159
jamming so in fact the idea is the

648
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
simple idea this is analogous to

649
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,320
um

650
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
so many things they currently do in the

651
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,880
wireless

652
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,679
domain when

653
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
you have an attack you just you want to

654
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
effectively

655
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,880
detect it and then maybe change switch

656
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
to a different channel

657
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
you know a

658
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,320
different encryption of whatever

659
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
maneuver that you

660
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,360
want to implement but

661
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,480
um

662
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
within the aws uh

663
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,000
ai tool suite there

664
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
we can use the

665
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
anomaly detection algorithms because

666
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
what we're looking at

667
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
really are

668
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
features

669
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
that we're considering and we have to

670
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
leverage the

671
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,279
harness the compute computational power

672
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,640
of the

673
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,600
the cloud so

674
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
but you got to choose the right features

675
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
you got to use the right algorithms you

676
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,279
got to worry about um

677
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
false positives

678
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
of course negatives and true positives

679
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
and

680
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,520
and the training you need lots of data

681
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
because uh

682
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,880
or a large data set to train

683
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
and so that you can minimize the false

684
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,840
positives

685
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,279
but uh the

686
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
uh algorithm that we

687
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
of choice that we're using is the

688
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,320
recurrent neural networks lstm model

689
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,600
okay

690
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
and so

691
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
a jamming countermeasure

692
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
uh

693
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
uh

694
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,799
this is uh how we lev utilize this

695
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,679
in a uh and i call it cloud in the loop

696
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
where we actually

697
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,440
do some pre-processing

698
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,559
and

699
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,120
on the data

700
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
this is of course after the uh

701
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
the

702
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,840
the ai is

703
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,159
trained uh we get a score we just look

704
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,799
post processing and then we can

705
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,559
we we uh

706
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,799
basically channel hop

707
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,240
and um

708
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,919
this uh we

709
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
this is the

710
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
um

711
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,600
this is the

712
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,279
countermeasure that we have developed

713
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,080
or

714
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,400
currently developing so

715
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
uh it we've done a proof of concept

716
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,520
and the result initial results are very

717
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,000
promising

718
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,559
our next project

719
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,840
deals with

720
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
so this

721
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
the previous project dealt with

722
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,400
uh

723
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,480
one end of the spectrum at the cloud so

724
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
to speak

725
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,559
leveraging cloud resources to

726
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
enhance security so this one

727
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
we're working at the other

728
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,679
end of the spectrum right at the edge or

729
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,120
at the the actual iot device

730
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,000
and

731
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
uh this project involved

732
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,440
um our work in the nist

733
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
lightweight crypto

734
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
um

735
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,600
so we wanted to the the ten finalists

736
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
final algorithms that were selected

737
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,559
um

738
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
are we want to see how resilient they

739
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,799
are to side channel

740
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,919
attacks

741
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,520
so

742
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
um

743
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,159
side channel attacks

744
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,279
uh the

745
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,000
two types there's em attacks but i'm

746
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,880
gonna

747
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,440
dive a little deeper into you know what

748
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,840
is a side channel attack so i'm gonna

749
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
skip a few slides so

750
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,640
the way

751
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
we this is a classic

752
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,600
uh it's

753
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
it's found on the basis of

754
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
the channel um shannon's

755
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,559
um

756
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,520
or

757
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,440
it's community all it's a basic

758
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
communications problem so whereby

759
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
every electronic device it it leaks they

760
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,799
naturally leak information

761
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,080
so these are through unintended channels

762
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,559
okay and those these unattended channels

763
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
are side channels

764
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
um so

765
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,399
you either have intended or unintended

766
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,240
the intended channels that you where you

767
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,279
want to

768
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,679
leak your data information to include

769
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,640
your displays

770
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,760
you know card readers etc but your

771
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,559
unintended channels are

772
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
could be the em radiation

773
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,880
um

774
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
uh that

775
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,640
emanating that emanates from the device

776
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,799
uh sound light

777
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,360
you can use time or power

778
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,480
and

779
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
if you can develop so

780
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,399
it's a channel

781
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
and typically

782
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
attacks usually require even

783
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,279
eavesdropping whether someone logs into

784
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
your network

785
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,960
uh gets into your network and sits there

786
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
to monitor things or

787
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,120
they're listening in you need

788
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
a some kind of receiver

789
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,279
to

790
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,520
listen in on that channel so and they

791
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,720
require

792
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,760
and you need access so

793
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,640
um

794
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
and there are two types of

795
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,240
side channel with

796
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
channel attacks passive and active

797
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,200
the passives the

798
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
ones they analyze things such as

799
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,000
timing power

800
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,559
electromagnetic

801
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
emissions

802
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
and where the goal is you just want to

803
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,240
observe

804
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,440
uh you want to access the device so you

805
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
can observe

806
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,840
it while it's doing its crypto operation

807
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
so if you can do so today

808
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,240
if you can do so you can actually

809
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
um

810
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,559
use uh correlation analysis to

811
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,399
brute force and the

812
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,399
computers are very fast lots of memory

813
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,039
today so you can brute force and you can

814
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,240
actually recreate the encryption key

815
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
just by guessing

816
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
um using uh but you have to there's

817
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
a little bit more

818
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
involved in that and then you have your

819
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
active

820
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
where you want to alter the device's

821
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,840
behavior and

822
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
for example you want to

823
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,840
you have a secure boot

824
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,519
okay where it sits in the loop and waits

825
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,799
for you to enter

826
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
a password or what have you

827
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,519
you can zap the device

828
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,279
with a glitch

829
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,200
a voltage glitch

830
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,159
or

831
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,880
um an em pulse

832
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,679
and since the non-invasive ways to use

833
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
em so a lot of our work is done using em

834
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
so

835
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
it's of course it where we can go

836
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
through package and you could if you zap

837
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
it at the right time

838
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,279
you can cause it to step out of that

839
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,320
loop

840
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
that is in

841
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
while it's waiting for it's you know a

842
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,760
key entry and this is fault injection

843
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
so these are very effective techniques

844
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,440
too

845
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,039
and

846
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,000
the the power analysis technique well

847
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,399
all power analysis techniques

848
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
rely on

849
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,399
the switching activity of

850
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,519
mosf the the mosfet devices

851
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,120
and

852
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,440
you have during these transitions when

853
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
the while the gate is

854
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
transitioning it emits power

855
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
and it's that power

856
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,519
um

857
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,279
that you can

858
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,279
use to correlate with

859
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,279
uh measured

860
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,039
with the actual measured data so

861
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
so we said you gotta

862
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,519
build an experiment so we have a target

863
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,640
board

864
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
um that's run where you have an embedded

865
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,559
pro processor that's running a 128-bit

866
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
camera mode

867
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,120
most of the

868
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,918
new standards

869
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,440
the

870
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,120
finalists

871
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,080
final algorithms use aes counter mode

872
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,158
and

873
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
encryption

874
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,039
and so we implemented on the core z7

875
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,320
board

876
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
and so forth but what's required

877
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
in your setup you need a scope

878
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
you need

879
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,480
a probe of course

880
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,240
and you need a computer to control

881
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,679
and acquire to um gather the data so

882
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,120
that you can do your correlation

883
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
analysis

884
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,080
okay

885
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,320
and um

886
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,440
uh so you have an xyz station

887
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,480
but the

888
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,799
one but before you even start that you

889
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,120
need to uh so this is on the left the

890
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
picture on the left is the actual target

891
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
so we have on an xyz station

892
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,840
and

893
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,760
you before you do anything you need to

894
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,600
know where you're going to probe you

895
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,840
don't have any prior information or

896
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,600
knowledge about the layout where the

897
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,240
cryptographic

898
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,559
uh operations are performing on a chip

899
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,880
so you do an exhaustive scan to find

900
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
that you put the chip in

901
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,679
the crypt

902
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,080
crypto in the loop and you run it

903
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,720
and you exactly scan the chip until you

904
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,360
find the sweet spot to where

905
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,600
all of the activity is

906
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,399
so

907
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,679
that's where you're going to launch your

908
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,200
em attack

909
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
okay

910
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,159
and so after you do that

911
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,280
there are other

912
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
issues that you have to

913
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,960
worry about

914
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
such as you want to make sure that the

915
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,040
signal noise ratio is pretty good

916
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,280
in order to

917
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
that's a requirement to perform

918
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,119
um

919
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,679
side channel

920
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,639
perform correlation analysis

921
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,520
and

922
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
uh

923
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,520
where you

924
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
the

925
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,960
correlation and we use we develop some

926
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
tools using matlab to do the

927
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,399
correlation analysis we're using the

928
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,960
pearson correlation where which allows

929
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
you to compare uh

930
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,560
uh

931
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,079
two data sets

932
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
so we collect over about three million

933
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
data sets but so this is a correlation

934
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,839
parallel analysis is very

935
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,520
very um

936
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
very time consuming

937
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
your setup

938
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,720
you get collected faces

939
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,680
and so forth and but we've uh but you

940
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,240
can do you can set it up and automate it

941
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,119
some of it can be automated a lot of

942
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,880
can be automated

943
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,400
um

944
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
so what we learned

945
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,680
from our

946
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,359
this experiment is that

947
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,880
we can jaffy is another attack

948
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
that show that there's very little to no

949
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
um

950
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,079
material in literature

951
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,640
um that shows the effective

952
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,920
effectiveness of the joffrey attack on

953
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,240
correlation power analysis

954
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,040
so

955
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,320
um

956
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
we wanted to

957
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,839
see how well

958
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,760
uh we you know how effective it can be

959
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,599
and um

960
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,560
the results we got was very promising

961
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
uh we were able to

962
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,320
uh recover

963
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,560
uh the first

964
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,320
bite um and um

965
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,280
uh using a first order so joffrey

966
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,240
attack is is is

967
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,480
an attack that not only can you get the

968
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,280
loud

969
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
uh juffy attack can get you give you uh

970
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,560
the encryption key

971
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,800
the key but in addition to that you can

972
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
also get the nouns that was used to

973
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,560
generate that key

974
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,079
and so

975
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,530
um

976
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,839
[Music]

977
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,000
yeah so this shows is very promising

978
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,400
um

979
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
but again this is that

980
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
months of work

981
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,079
and it's going to to break 128-bit

982
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,520
decryption of lots of we have uh the

983
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,280
this runs on a

984
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,160
uh

985
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,520
the server

986
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
we run the software

987
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,680
um

988
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,359
um but

989
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,160
some of the things we want to accomplish

990
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,920
um is

991
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
to reduce

992
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
one thing is to reduce the number of

993
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
traces

994
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,839
uh jaffrey attack requires lots of faith

995
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,160
and the whole key here

996
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,359
the key idea here is to reduce the

997
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,000
amount of time on the

998
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
on the system

999
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,000
um we also want to perform test vector

1000
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,560
leakage assessment on

1001
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,359
known keys so

1002
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,839
uh

1003
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,320
now a little bit about

1004
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,240
let's shift gears a little bit and talk

1005
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,359
about a workforce development strategy

1006
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,040
um

1007
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
where we begin

1008
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,079
it begins at their

1009
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
really at the sixth to eighth grade

1010
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
level

1011
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,079
and so we have a string together

1012
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,320
of

1013
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,480
some very successful programs that we

1014
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
have

1015
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,599
and um

1016
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
that work and

1017
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
this particular model works because

1018
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,280
anyways

1019
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,200
we start with the gen cyber program

1020
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,520
that's a nsa program

1021
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,480
and

1022
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,560
the program we have where we bring

1023
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,760
about 40 middle school girls in from the

1024
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,599
baltimore city

1025
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,359
for about over a two week period over

1026
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,280
the summer and we introduce them to

1027
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
basic cyber concepts

1028
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,880
uh they then go on to the local high

1029
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,520
schools they graduate

1030
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,760
and then we have the pace program the

1031
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,000
pre-accelerated curriculum

1032
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,040
in engineering program called pace

1033
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,800
where we bring the

1034
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
these are

1035
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,599
students

1036
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,079
who are um we bring them in the summer

1037
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,440
before their

1038
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
freshman matriculation

1039
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,300
and we

1040
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,760
[Music]

1041
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,000
over a five-week period

1042
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,320
we have them on campus

1043
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,040
and we introduced them to

1044
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,920
where they get a total immersion in

1045
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,480
calculus and physics

1046
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,520
and

1047
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,640
we assessed the method of program and

1048
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,359
those students

1049
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,560
um

1050
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,480
those students i

1051
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,359
uh the top 10 or so of the students i

1052
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,000
offer scholarships to right off the bat

1053
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
i pair them with a mentor so

1054
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,839
um

1055
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,880
our philosophy so what drives all of

1056
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,040
this is our philosophy

1057
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,839
which is centered around

1058
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,440
it takes a village

1059
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,920
to raise a family so

1060
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,280
where every

1061
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
stakeholder

1062
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,040
who

1063
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,000
interacts with that student

1064
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,720
plays a pivotal role

1065
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,680
in their success

1066
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,280
uh but where's all this uh

1067
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,359
takes money

1068
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,560
and so

1069
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,440
we were able to leverage

1070
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
a wide variety of sources funding

1071
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,079
sources and programs to

1072
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,240
to

1073
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,480
such as the the nist prep program

1074
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,119
which is enables us to for a graduate

1075
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,960
student for example the is a

1076
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,000
professional research experience program

1077
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,160
where they actually pair there's lots of

1078
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,560
mentoring so they they not only provide

1079
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
support to fund the students but they

1080
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
also

1081
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
provide mentors so

1082
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,760
so we have

1083
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,920
the students are student

1084
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,359
peer mentors

1085
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,280
as well as professional

1086
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,760
mentors

1087
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,839
who come

1088
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,400
from uh

1089
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,359
you know our partners they're either

1090
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,359
other universities where we

1091
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,839
have uh

1092
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,359
um

1093
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,440
where uh these

1094
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,200
we have faculty

1095
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,599
from different universities serving on

1096
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,240
the students dissertation committee

1097
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,359
our same goes for industry and

1098
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,680
government partners

1099
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,880
there

1100
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,480
we require that all of our phd students

1101
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,640
they they have an industry

1102
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,520
you know

1103
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
their sponsor

1104
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,200
mentor

1105
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
and who serves on their dissertation

1106
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,319
committee

1107
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,839
this ensures

1108
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,200
this is all to helps to ensure student

1109
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
success

1110
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,119
level undergraduate level we have a wide

1111
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
variety of capstone we have different

1112
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,079
ways to engage

1113
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,839
the students to

1114
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,000
help them get

1115
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,440
experiential

1116
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,599
learning experiences

1117
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,560
either through industrial internships

1118
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,400
capstone projects

1119
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,599
involving industry uh with industry

1120
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,960
mentors or

1121
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,760
work

1122
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,640
uh throughout the year with the student

1123
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,359
team on the project

1124
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,319
um

1125
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,920
so

1126
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,480
uh

1127
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,640
a little bit about our academic programs

1128
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,400
we have three

1129
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
our cae

1130
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,760
and cyber defenses uh we these are the

1131
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,040
courses so we have our bs program

1132
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,880
in electrical computing engineering

1133
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
where students take these five or six

1134
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,400
courses

1135
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
and they receive

1136
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,160
the bs

1137
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
in ece with a cyber security

1138
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,720
concentration

1139
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,560
as i mentioned earlier we have the mesi

1140
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,319
program and then we have our phd program

1141
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,040
in secure embedded systems

1142
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,839
um which is a

1143
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,760
um

1144
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,160
uh where students can come in from the

1145
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,599
which requires uh students who come

1146
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,240
with a bachelor's degree to complete

1147
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,119
60 credit hours and

1148
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,760
students who come with a master's degree

1149
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
uh can complete 36 hours

1150
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,240
um and this is uh includes an ompassant

1151
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
masters so they pick up their masters

1152
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,920
after completing

1153
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,960
automatically after completing 30 credit

1154
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,800
course hours

1155
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,520
um

1156
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,839
so this program

1157
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,119
is

1158
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,760
kind of unique

1159
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,280
um oh i'm going a little over so

1160
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,119
although we started so these are the

1161
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,359
courses affiliated with

1162
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
the program

1163
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
uh

1164
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,880
the skills profile of this the students

1165
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,119
who

1166
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,440
who grad

1167
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,839
graduate from the program

1168
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,480
uh they have background in cryptography

1169
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,440
software hardware communication

1170
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,200
understanding communication protocols

1171
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,319
a little bit of policy

1172
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,599
operating systems ai

1173
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,359
and so forth

1174
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,880
so these are

1175
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,960
the skills

1176
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,440
and lastly

1177
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
the workforce impact just to give you

1178
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,560
something we're now up to about 25

1179
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,160
students

1180
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,880
phd students in the secure beta systems

1181
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
peak program

1182
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,240
uh 30 of women women and 82 percent are

1183
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,079
us citizens

1184
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,800
uh the model i just showed you earlier

1185
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,280
it works

1186
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,839
these four we just graduated our first

1187
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,359
cohort of

1188
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,880
students

1189
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,000
um

1190
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,040
in this past may uh

1191
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,160
who will be joining the likes of nsa

1192
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,079
johns hopkins applied physics lab nist

1193
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,599
and one is a postdoc

1194

in

1195
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,480
the cap center for a year

1196
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,319
all of our students are fully funded so

1197
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,040
we have a scholarship for service

1198
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,240
a dod scholarships gym scholarships

1199
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,880
minor nist prep scholars

1200
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,760
and so forth so

1201
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,599
that concludes my
