1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
hello everyone thank you for coming to

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,279
the action seminar and uh today it's our

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,520
great honor to have professor leo to

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
give us a talk

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,320
on the

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
cyber security action security in the

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,759
power grid and professor leo is

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,720
real

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
respected scholar and researcher in

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
power and i should say electrical power

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,000
and he has a long long long list of

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
actually his actual achievement i don't

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
want to have the old one currently he is

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
a professor in the virginia tech and

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
also the director of the power

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
and energy center

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
and he actually made a lot of a

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,879
treatment to receive a lot of medals i

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,160
think

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
20 years ago or 30 years ago so you can

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
say this is very special uh um

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,399
great actual achievement and

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,879
accomplishment and um

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,039
great job and the recent thing i think

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,640
of power grid and the power of action

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
right now is very important part of the

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
cyber security cyber physical system

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
right so professor du is going to show

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
us actually oh

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,159
uh show us actually his view about

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,720
action cyber physical system security in

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
the power grid and this will be great to

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,839
talk and let's welcome our speaker

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,080
great

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
so thank you very much

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
to me

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
it's my pleasure to be here and i know

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
we set up this seminar a few months ago

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
but it took a little while for this to

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
happen and i'm really pleased to have

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
this opportunity to

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
meet with you so to speak

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,280
and

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
be able to discuss this topic

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
about uh

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
power grid cyber security

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
and uh i remember when i started working

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
on this problem cyber security of power

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,320
grid that was 2006.

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,280
and there wasn't much of a research to

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
speak of at that time

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
um there were some papers about the

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,759
doomsday scenario if there's a cyber

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
attack they're going to take down a lot

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
of things and is gonna do a lot of bad

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,000
things

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
but i think there is an important

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
uh milestone one is uh

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
the government has a project i think

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
it's called aurora project which

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
actually did a test at the national lab

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
setting which actually shows

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
there's a model of a substation

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
and a cyber attack launched from that

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
model substation can actually damage the

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,280
diesel engine diesel generator so which

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
means cyber attack can actually damage

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
the physical system components and i

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
think that was an important

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
wake-up call

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
and but then of course since then

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
a lot has happened and particularly

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
uh you will see

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
we were

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
let's see

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,640
good

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
so particularly well now we're looking

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
at ukraine power system

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
and this is not meant to be matched with

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
the current events today

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
but this is uh possibly

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
the first major attack publicly reported

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
attack on the power grid in 2015

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
that actually caused a major power

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,360
outage

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
and it happened in ukraine

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,560
and so

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
and it's interesting because uh before

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
that we know it could be done

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
and

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,159
and we know

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,879
we know the the power grid

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
has come to a stage where the cyber

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,720
system is important and it's the new new

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
class of threats that's coming to the

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,360
power grid but this is the first

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
publicly reported major outage outage

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,400
and so it's an important milestone in

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
this research topic

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
and how did this happen if you

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
let's see

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
so if you actually look at this

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
if you look at these slides

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
the title of the slide is is interesting

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
it says cyber security of our

106
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,560
infrastructure

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,439
so that cyber because normally people's

108
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,759
impression about power grid is you have

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
power plants you have substations you

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
have lines power lines you have release

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
motors

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
etc that's what our image of our grid

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
but there is actually an important i.t

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
and communication infrastructure that

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
sits on top of that

116
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
and this picture is intended to show

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
that and what does that mean

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,360
there is something called scada which is

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
a supervisory control and data

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,639
acquisition

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
so this is the computer and

122
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,120
communication system which allows power

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
grid to acquire data to data acquisition

124
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
from a wide spread

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
power grid

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,240
and collect them into a control center

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
you see here control center a control

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
center b

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
and this control center collects the

130
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
data make the decision and then they

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
send the

132
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
control commands back to the substation

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
and this box on the right hand side

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
represent the

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
the substation so you can see the black

136
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
color represent the physical components

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
circuit breaker transformer etc etc

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
that's the power grid and then the red

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
color and also the

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
the black dotted uh colored

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,479
communication system and protocol that

142
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,840
represent the cyber system so this dmp

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,320
three this is the protocol between

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
uh control system and

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
control center and substations

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
and there is this iccp which is the

147
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
protocol between two control centers or

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,919
between different power grids and so you

149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
can see here

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
the site the power grid

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
relies on that

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
communication system and i.t to run the

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
power grid and therefore there are

154
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
vulnerabilities so let me go back

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
one slide

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
and so what is that empower grid has

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,319
been around for 100 more than a hundred

158
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
years so what is that cyborg

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
so you can say the scada system exists

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,960
from

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,759
from probably 60s 50s they're already

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,080
there but the software

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
the sophisticated software to run the

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
power grid they came in probably from

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
70s 80s 90s

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
and

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
but then from the 80s there is a trend

168
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
for the system computer communication

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
system to be more open

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
open system

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
and and also more standardized so

172
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
before that time 80s you go to a power

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
grid look at their real-time

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
computer systems it is a special

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,319
special purpose real-time processor

176
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
there's a primary there's a backup and

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
they look different from what we have

178
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
today if you go to a control center

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
today look at the computer i.t equipment

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,960
of the

181
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,919
of the

182
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
power system control center they look

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
like your desktop at home or any lab

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
at purdue university it would look the

185
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,880
same

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
so so that's because

187
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,919
the technology is more standardized and

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,639
also there's a widespread availability

189
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
of technical information

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
and there's a specific reason for the

191
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
power grid because

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,599
this part this equipment the operation

193
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
and control it

194
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
equipment is a scada system or we call

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
the energy management system ems or

196
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
distribution management system in the

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,919
whole world there will only be a handful

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,360
of major multinational vendors

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
which means

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
any country any big power grid you're

201
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
trying to buy such a system

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
most likely you're going to be buying

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
from one of them and it's you can count

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
with students the multinational vendors

205
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
which means there is not much of a

206
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,280
secret because what you know is what

207
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
many other people know

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,960
and that's what this widespread

209
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,280
availability of technical information

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
means because

211
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
because of the

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
because there's so much similarity of

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,199
the systems around in the globally

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
what you know is not much of a secret

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
many other people know that

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,919
so

217
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
so that is why uh there is that

218
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
vulnerability that sort of building in

219
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
industry

220
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
and the the power industry or the

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
the regulatory agency is doing something

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,399
this

223
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
this um

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,399
north american electric reliability

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
corporation is called nerc

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,600
in the power

227
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
industry nurk is the agency that sets

228
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,760
the standards for north america and

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
power grid and so cyber security as an

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,720
important topic is already recognized so

231
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
these are the kind of standard that has

232
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,680
been set up by by nerf and the industry

233
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
has

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
the industry power companies power

235
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
systems have to abide by this

236
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
standard because it is not

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
it's not voluntary so there is a it's a

238
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
standard and so

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,440
so it there is a every six months or so

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
there will be some kind of auditing to

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
make sure you meet the standard

242
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
however

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
the standards here if you look at this

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
standard they are kind of general high

245
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
level

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
for example critical asset

247
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
identification

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
and then personnel training

249
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
and physical security

250
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
and incident reporting and response

251
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
planning etc

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
so these are kind of a general

253
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
guidelines so essentially what these

254
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
guidelines says you shall be good but it

255
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,279
does not tell you exactly what you have

256
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
to do there is still a lot of a lot of

257
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
the degree of freedom for the industry

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
to decide what they do but they have to

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
meet this requirement

260
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
so there is not a standard practice that

261
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,079
the industry is following about how to

262
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
protect your system

263
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
and

264
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,839
how to

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
mitigate the cyber attack

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
but does it happen

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
i would not say there's a successful

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,399
attack happen

269
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
often but i can tell you the attempts of

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,959
this such attack is very much there

271
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,519
so just a few months ago one of the big

272
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,880
power grid

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
manager told me

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,760
the company their company has been

275
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
there's there has been two billion

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
attempts

277
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
on this

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
on the power grid

279
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
and so you can see

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
there's a lot of

281
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,760
interest in the power grid in that sense

282
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,279
now and so

283
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,440
so what do we need from a technology

284
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,839
point of view and from a conceptual

285
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
point of view research point of view

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
how do we increase the

287
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,600
protection of the power grid

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,560
so

289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
if i try to summarize the the

290
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
state-of-the-art

291
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
literature of this area

292
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
then

293
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
you can pretty much say on the

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
transmission system

295
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,519
there is a there is a

296
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
data acquisition device which is called

297
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
phaser measurement units which actually

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
was invented by virginia tech

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,519
some

300
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,519
34 years ago

301
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,640
and scada this is what i just mentioned

302
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
and substation automation

303
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
this is the software and id technology

304
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
that actually runs the

305
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,320
substation

306
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,399
and in the distribution level the lower

307
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
voltage level that connects to all the

308
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
customers

309
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
then we have

310
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,920
distributed energy resources this is

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
about the renewable energy and

312
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,320
energy storage

313
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
and then advanced metering structure

314
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
this is the smart meters

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
and the smart meter is connected to many

316
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
many customers in the u.s so

317
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,600
it's safe to say more than 50 percent of

318
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
the electric

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
uh electricity customers

320
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
are using smart meters so somewhere

321
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,480
outside your house or apartment there is

322
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,839
a box there

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
that's a smart meter and that smart

324
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,399
meter is connected by communication

325
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,440
and

326
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
every 15 minutes or 30 minutes is

327
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,920
sending the energy consumption data to a

328
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
to a power company and they use that for

329
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
fitting but they also use that remote

330
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
for remote access for example

331
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
if you have a power outage you call the

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,279
power company

333
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
and they check your customer information

334
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
and they find that you have not paid

335
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,160
your bill for three months

336
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,079
then they would be long

337
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
so your power was cut off through that

338
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,639
small meter box and so they will laugh

339
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
at you and you better go home and pay

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
your bill

341
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
so and then distribution automation and

342
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
this is the last 10 years or so

343
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,600
a lot of the remote control switches and

344
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,079
devices on the distribution grid has

345
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,959
happened

346
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
in the last 10 years or

347
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
and so and because they are remote

348
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
control there's vaughn there so you can

349
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,880
see

350
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,079
from from these different categories

351
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,320
the power grid has different pockets of

352
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
communication

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,639
system

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,839
and

355
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
and unfortunately it's not one system so

356
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
it's not seamless it's different systems

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
and so there's a question of whether or

358
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,079
not

359
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,120
you can one attack

360
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
one can protect all these systems as a

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,399
whole

362
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
and then in in terms of research

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
sub-topic there's a vulnerability

364
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
assessment

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
and that includes modeling the system

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
impact analysis

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
and also identify the weakness and then

368
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
intrusion anomaly detection so this part

369
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
is still in the early stage and a lot of

370
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
what i talked about

371
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,279
is this intrusion and anomaly detection

372
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
and then there's some mitigation this is

373
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
when is attacked you know something's

374
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
going wrong how do you do it and usually

375
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
if it happened in the cyber system how

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
do you do it is happening on the

377
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,800
physical system already how you mitigate

378
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,839
that

379
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,199
so and now in

380
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,880
so in the empower power grid area we are

381
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,160
very used to uh finding a list of

382
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
potential we call that contingencies or

383
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,000
or events so for example severe weather

384
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,639
is advanced cyber attack will be another

385
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,519
event next one could be uh earthquake

386
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,639
etc

387
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
and so we have a list of these

388
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,920
contingencies and and the normal

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,480
practice is trying to find trying to

390
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
find the worst case scenario because the

391
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
reliability of power grid is very

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,360
important for the society and economy

393
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and so we want to look for the

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
worst case or we can actually try to fix

395
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
the bottleneck and plug the hole of the

396
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,560
threads

397
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,519
and so

398
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,399
what's new here is the cyber attack

399
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
should be considered a new list added to

400
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,160
this

401
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,120
master list which we already have

402
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
over many decades but most of uh weather

403
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
related events hurricane and earthquake

404
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
but now this cyber vulnerability has

405
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
become part of it and so if i have a way

406
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
to to create a list

407
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
and then i can measure the vulnerability

408
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
then i will have a much more scientific

409
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
way to figure out how we can mitigate

410
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
and how we can improve the cyber

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
security

412
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,680
of the grid

413
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,959
and so this

414
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,440
equation simply means uh something very

415
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,120
simple it says

416
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
if you want to

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
if you want to measure the impact of a

418
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,279
contingency event as i mentioned you

419
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
need two things one is the probability

420
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
how likely can it happen

421
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,399
two is the impact that what does that

422
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
mean to the power grid if the attack is

423
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
successful

424
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
and so these are the two symbols that

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
represent this the probability and the

426
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,360
impact if i can find these two numbers

427
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
quantify them and i add add together all

428
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,440
the access points i will get a 130

429
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
measure and so if i go to the boss

430
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
of a power company i said we need to

431
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,720
improve the security

432
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
and the boss says okay why do you need

433
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,360
10 million to do it oh i said because

434
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,839
with 10 million i would be able to

435
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,800
improve the vulnerability

436
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
from exa number to y number

437
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
and that means the power outage will be

438
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,759
reduced by how much and not to mention

439
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,040
the the

440
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,480
public reaction uh just that reduced

441
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
power outage would be enough benefits to

442
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,919
cover that so that would be uh how we

443
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
that's why we need

444
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
we need the vulnerability quantified

445
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
and so then first thing i need to get

446
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
probably so how do we do that

447
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,079
and here is a simple example this is

448
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,240
actually represented firewall we all

449
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
have firewalls on our computer systems

450
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,079
right

451
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,359
and uh

452
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
and the firewall is simply a set of

453
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,960
rules that define

454
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,760
who gets in who cannot and so this

455
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,480
picture shows who once defines who can

456
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
get in access

457
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,039
and the another group can get in an end

458
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
group can get in

459
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,360
and then if you don't meet any of these

460
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,320
rules then it will be denied and you can

461
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
keep trying as a attacker if you keep

462
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,840
trying

463
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,799
and so if i collect enough data i'll be

464
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
able to see how many attempts and how

465
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
many successful how many failed and by

466
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
that statistics i'll be able to find a

467
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
probability and so for this particular

468
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
firewall i'll be able to find uh

469
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
what's the probability that you can the

470
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,000
attempt to be able to successfully

471
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
access the system

472
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
and that's how you get probability

473
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
and how do i get the impact

474
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
so to get the impact is much more

475
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
complicated because uh

476
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
because we are dealing with a cyber

477
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
physical system cyber is the scada

478
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
system and other related

479
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
information and communication system

480
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
and the physical system is the power

481
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
grid and traditionally we know how we

482
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
simulate power system a lot

483
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
but we don't simulate

484
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
the id

485
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
communication with the power system

486
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,559
and so that is the problem the model of

487
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,360
the cyber system and the integrated

488
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
model of the cyber system plus the power

489
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,039
system that's missing and so this allows

490
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,280
the research there is to find

491
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
uh be able to integrate those two

492
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
systems so i'll be able to

493
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,039
assume some assume

494
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
hypothesized

495
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
cyber attack scenarios and then actually

496
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,400
simulate how the attacks are launched

497
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
and how they access the physical power

498
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,440
system if you don't get intercepted and

499
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
how what how much what it means to the

500
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
power grid okay

501
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
and that is an important

502
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,720
uh research topic and actually this is

503
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
the bottom of this is a phd this is one

504
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,160
of my students uh stefanov and this is

505
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,200
2015. so that's when we actually have

506
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,679
have a systematic way of a cyber system

507
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,600
model scalar system

508
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
and

509
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
and the power grid and bring them

510
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,440
together okay i'm not saying that cyber

511
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
system is not there the scada system has

512
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
been there for a few decades as i

513
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,799
mentioned

514
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,960
but the software model which allows you

515
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,559
to do the study is not quite there

516
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,120
okay so this is a picture representing

517
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
the software model i'm talking about so

518
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
the bottom is easy that represents the

519
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
power system

520
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
and the red the three layers on top

521
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
represent the cyber system so there's a

522
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
transmission operator there's a control

523
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
center level there's a substation level

524
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,360
so this transmission level will be like

525
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,559
a big

526
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,120
big power grid so for virginia here it

527
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
will be pjm interconnection okay and

528
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
maybe you too so that pgm

529
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
interconnection is the highest level

530
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,840
transmission

531
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
grid operator and then the next level

532
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
will be local power component so for

533
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
here it will be the apparation power

534
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
which is a branch of the american

535
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
electric power company

536
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,799
and the bottom here will be the

537
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,280
substations and one substation is right

538
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,240
here at the camp on campus virginia tech

539
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
and so

540
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
so we have to have a software model of

541
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
this so you can study you can look if

542
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
you look into these boxes it's not power

543
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
component it's it components

544
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,080
and so what we did is we actually use

545
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
the computer cues

546
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,000
and to construct the model

547
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
of the it model here and that represents

548
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
how the data is acquired how is transfer

549
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
to the control center how communication

550
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,600
latency happens and if anything there is

551
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720
attack like some communication link is

552
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
destroyed or the

553
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
there's a

554
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
distributed denial of service to

555
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
increase the latency then how do you

556
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
actually model that and what's the

557
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,280
impact of our grid that's where they

558
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
came from

559
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
and so

560
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,640
and once i can integrate that so here is

561
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
an equation don't worry about this

562
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
equation what it means is that

563
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
i want for the physical power grid i'm

564
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
watching the performance

565
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
the frequency at home you 160 earth

566
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
this is the load at home you you want

567
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
how many kilowatts you need at home

568
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
that's what you need

569
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
and then there's a voltage you want 120

570
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,159
volts you you you are watching that and

571
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
there's a current on the power lines you

572
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,799
don't want overloads and power lines so

573
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
by watching all these from simulation

574
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
you're able to see the impacts on the

575
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
power grid for example

576
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
if the grid is losing a lot of loads

577
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
that will be this index this term will

578
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,039
be

579
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
will have high value

580
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,679
if frequency begins to begin to to

581
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
decline then you'll see a high value

582
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,600
represented there

583
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,919
and so this picture shows you how we

584
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,840
measure the impact on the power grid

585
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
and then

586
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
so the next one is uh how do we prevent

587
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,600
the

588
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,159
the intrusion and i mentioned

589
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
uh this intrusion detection

590
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
the concept is very simple what it means

591
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,559
is traditionally we have firewall to

592
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
protect the substation you see a

593
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,799
firewall here but the firewall as i

594
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,960
showed you a few minutes ago it's an

595
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
access control

596
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
it's like so access is like a door who

597
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,320
can pass who cannot pass the security

598
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,200
guard but then once you get in the door

599
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
what you're doing you don't know and

600
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,919
that's why this intrusion detection is

601
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,559
more like an intelligent system you like

602
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,600
the data log from the from the id system

603
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
communication and from there you do your

604
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,440
analysis to see if there's any anomalies

605
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,919
happening in a substation and that's the

606
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
purpose of this

607
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
intrusion detection system and to be

608
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,760
more specific in the substation level i

609
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
would i will mention two things that the

610
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,919
red color here

611
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
one is this thing called modify boost

612
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
message this is a substation it network

613
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,640
and whatever that means this red bubble

614
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,960
here means falsified

615
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
operational command of circuit breakers

616
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
so this is very important because this

617
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,240
like what happened in ukraine in 2015

618
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,799
to open that circuit breaker i need to

619
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,480
be able to either

620
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,919
use the

621
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,960
the authenticate

622
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,559
the authenticate control command or i

623
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,360
can falsify control command convince the

624
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
system that

625
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,360
you the breaker should be open and

626
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,240
that's how you uh disconnect the load

627
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
and on the right hand side this is the

628
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,039
this is the fabricate measurements so

629
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,000
this is in a substation and i will show

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
you an example later also you look at

631
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,679
the measurements

632
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,400
for let's say a voltage and i take the

633
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
voltage and i sort of do a random

634
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,559
falsify measurement and give it let's

635
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,320
say very high voltage

636
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,799
and send it to the control center

637
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
the system operator sitting in front of

638
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
console they look at that and say oh my

639
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,919
god there's a big problem and they start

640
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
react and they start to do the control

641
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,039
actions and trying to bring down the

642
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,520
voltage but that also contribute the

643
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,480
problem because the problem is not

644
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,440
is is fabricated but the actions are

645
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
real so the damage will be done because

646
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
of that

647
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,120
okay so now how do i simulate uh this

648
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,760
type of events this picture shows a

649
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,039
cyber physical system simulation testbed

650
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,120
so on top here is a power system

651
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,200
simulation tool that's we call that

652
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
power system simulator and on the left

653
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,080
hand side here this is a simulation of

654
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
the information communication

655
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,520
command so i can i can synthesize the

656
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
communication command with the software

657
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,559
here

658
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
and right inside this bubble will

659
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
represent the research so i want to

660
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,919
analyze the similarity of attack and

661
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
impact analysis etc and they are

662
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,679
connected by this yellow box which gives

663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,640
you a real-time kind of interaction so

664
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,279
if i want to open a breaker this yellow

665
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,679
box go into the power system actually

666
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,240
change that breaker status and say hey

667
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
you open up and power system simulation

668
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
will start to do the simulation and tell

669
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
you what happened okay

670
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
and that is what i'm going to show you

671
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
here in this uh

672
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
very simple demo

673
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
so left hand side is a power grid okay

674
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
this represents the red color means

675
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
breaker is closed and this white bar

676
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
means the substations so you can imagine

677
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
a big power grid spread in very wide

678
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,880
geographic area and many power lines and

679
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
circuit breaker means

680
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
red means the lines are energized

681
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,760
and later the cyber attack is going to

682
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,400
open circuit breakers in seven

683
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
substations and that is a that is a

684
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,559
coordinate attack or multiple attack and

685
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,640
through that it's going to take down

686
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
some generation

687
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
shut down some power plants

688
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
and because of that

689
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
the system

690
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,039
the

691
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
system is not able to serve the law

692
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
because load is the same and so

693
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,919
frequency will begin to drop and move

694
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,159
this will begin to go crazy and that is

695
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,480
what you expect on the right hand side

696
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,520
because i'm now showing you a cyber

697
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
left-hand side and right-hand side is

698
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,080
the physical system simulation that's

699
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,480
the impact on the power system so this

700
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,279
will answer that question of the impact

701
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
and when we talk about vulnerability so

702
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
let's go so attack has happened this

703
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
represent the attack packets are now

704
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,960
being sent in substation and it happens

705
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
very fast because it's id

706
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,880
and the right hand side you can see

707
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,840
power grid is also reacting because

708
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,279
the frequency is is falling and voltage

709
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,880
is also falling

710
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,679
and

711
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,240
then you can see some of the

712
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,679
breakers in the flashing substation the

713
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,600
breakers instead of being red they are

714
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
now empty

715
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
dark boxes that means breaker has been

716
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
opened and so some generators that

717
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
generation is lost

718
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,320
and then load is still there so

719
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,039
frequency is dropping and the system is

720
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,360
falling apart and when

721
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,000
frequency go down to about if you can

722
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
read it 58

723
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,360
58 hertz in the power grid

724
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,320
59 hertz 58 hertz that's already very

725
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,279
serious and so you can imagine the

726
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,000
automatic load shedding equipment in the

727
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,799
substations they will be triggered and

728
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,200
you start cutting loads and at home you

729
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
feel the power outage and this is what

730
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,919
happened in the ukraine power grid and

731
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,440
you can see

732
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
the power outage and now the question is

733
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
now what okay

734
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
so the now what

735
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,120
first step is the

736
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,279
um

737
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,080
how do we the medication so how do we

738
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
prevent something like this so if you

739
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
look at this picture there's a there's a

740
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,679
substation here the i.t system of

741
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
substation and there is a yellow box

742
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
here it's called anomaly detection

743
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,039
system

744
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,880
and that is actually the result of a

745
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
couple of phd thesis

746
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
and the idea there is

747
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,159
you look at you you develop the logic or

748
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,120
the intelligent system if you would so

749
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,240
it's based on logic or intelligence you

750
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
look at the the commands

751
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
the commands going through the

752
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,840
substation and you can identify which

753
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,880
one is normal which one is abnormal and

754
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
and that's why that's because you can

755
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,000
recognize which command has been

756
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,520
falsified a simple example is there is a

757
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,559
type of

758
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,840
a replay attack which means you take an

759
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,480
authentic control command and you bring

760
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,520
it back later at a later time and

761
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,760
somehow the system is not able to catch

762
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,320
them and so that's one simple example

763
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
but there's a lot of logic in this zero

764
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,440
box

765
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,360
and actually on the this there's a small

766
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,440
small red box at the bottom here or

767
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
lower

768
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
right it says this number here this

769
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
actually means the number of abnormal

770
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,919
packets that have been captured

771
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
and so you can so you can see by being

772
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,039
able to detect the anomalies you'll be

773
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
able to prevent these packets from

774
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
reaching the circuit breaker so that's

775
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,000
how we uh

776
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,559
mitigate the system and

777
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
another important thing here is by being

778
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,039
captured here among that 1500 more

779
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,399
packets

780
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,320
by being captured here within the

781
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,279
substation they have not hit the

782
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,159
physical system yet which means the

783
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,720
circuit breaker still closed control

784
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,559
center operators don't even know

785
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,720
something has happened because you are

786
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,399
able to work in a cyber system level and

787
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,120
being able to capture that attack

788
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,559
commands

789
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,120
within the cyber system and that's the

790
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,240
key because then the physical system is

791
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,799
not impacted but that also means it's a

792
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,720
big challenge from technology point of

793
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,440
view because within the cyber system you

794
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,919
are working in a millisecond level and

795
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,399
so everything has to be fast no matter

796
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,320
how smart your algorithm claims to be

797
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
all right so here is another example

798
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,760
that shows uh

799
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
that shows

800
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
the coordinate attack so the picture

801
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,919
here represent actually four different

802
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,080
counties of us of

803
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
a

804
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,279
state of washington i think you can see

805
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,640
george picture here so it must be

806
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,159
state of washington

807
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,240
and so this is trying to observe what's

808
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
happening this is intellect this is not

809
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,919
a real system

810
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,720
in the in this

811
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,440
power grid but it is a show how you

812
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,399
monitor the cyber attacks so you can see

813
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,159
there are four attacks here

814
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,600
and if you look at

815
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
the left-hand side box it says

816
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,799
abnormal behavior critical relation

817
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,640
geographic relation

818
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
so from the attack here it's not in the

819
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,159
same box

820
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,159
it so which means it's not the same

821
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,399
county you're not trying to attack the

822
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,880
same county substation in the same

823
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,200
geographic region rather

824
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,440
it by the analysis here you are trying

825
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,159
to attack the critical substations and

826
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,080
that's what critical means here so these

827
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,640
are the highest voltage transmission

828
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,600
substation that carries a lot of power

829
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,039
so any

830
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,919
any damage on these substations the

831
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,480
the impact will be very severe and

832
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,039
that's captured here it's identified as

833
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
a critical relation

834
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,559
and so this is how you

835
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,039
conclude there is a coordinate attack in

836
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,240
this case

837
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,320
okay so you are trying to look for the

838
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,360
relations that tie these attack together

839
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,880
so you can tell

840
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,919
these attacks according

841
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,120
and this is just a picture to show

842
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,679
how the how to identify the

843
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,519
coordinate attack

844
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,760
the relations i'm talking about abnormal

845
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
behavior critical substations geographic

846
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,519
data et cetera so you you take all the

847
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,000
information from the substation and run

848
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
through these

849
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,320
algorithms and that's how you get the

850
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,039
relations attack

851
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,000
and

852
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,519
so

853
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,919
so the next problem is what i mentioned

854
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,159
the measurement base attack so i

855
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,200
mentioned

856
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,159
you can

857
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,320
you sort of intercept the measurements

858
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,399
in the substation and here is a good

859
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,519
example

860
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,360
let's say there is a

861
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
there is a there is a back door access

862
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,480
to the substation okay

863
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,440
and in a substation there are things

864
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
there are a here means

865
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,039
uh you you collect the currents so

866
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
electrical engineers know this means

867
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,039
current amperes

868
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,120
and there's a v here that represent the

869
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,320
voltage and so the analog waveforms

870
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,120
converted into a digital format and

871
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,079
travel upstream the computers and i.t

872
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,159
equipment and then the communication

873
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,320
protocol they get sent to the control

874
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,839
center all right

875
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
if there's a backdoor access what could

876
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,520
happen is i i put some malware in the

877
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
substation

878
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,520
and along the path of the measurements i

879
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
start to fabricate

880
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
change the measurement and make it

881
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,560
just like that case i mentioned i create

882
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,879
this unbelievably high voltage

883
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,800
which will make the system operator

884
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,159
sweat

885
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,199
and because time is so fast

886
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
they don't know there's a cyber attack

887
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,359
yet so

888
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,918
so this is could be that one example and

889
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,599
how do we detect something like this

890
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
this is a research

891
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
this is the more research methods and i

892
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
think we have done

893
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
we have done that

894
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,760
how to identify these measurements so

895
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,599
how do you know these measurements that

896
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,880
make sense

897
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
and so falsify measurements they can

898
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,359
mislead system operators that's what i

899
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,240
said

900
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
and so we need some

901
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,640
we need some intrusion detection system

902
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,839
to detect

903
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,240
how these measurements

904
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
have been

905
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,320
how these have been falsified

906
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,440
so

907
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
so

908
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
in terms of

909
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,920
in terms of the analytics what it means

910
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,119
is i have an intrusion detection system

911
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,079
and

912
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,560
data collected from the grid

913
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
for example i collect this

914
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,079
scada system data or the phaser

915
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,480
measurement units i mentioned

916
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,119
and then i have a network data this is

917
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,960
it network data

918
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,200
and then i have a

919
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
intrusion detection system and i'm the

920
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,160
intrusion detection system is based on

921
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
the law of physics here that's why these

922
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,000
physical rules it's not very good

923
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,560
english what it means is the law of

924
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,599
physics

925
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,920
and from there i'm gonna detect these

926
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,680
measurements don't make sense because

927
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,400
they violate the law of physics and then

928
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,119
i i'm gonna figure out which data which

929
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,560
measurement should

930
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,720
should be discarded before they go out

931
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
of substation

932
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
and here is the law of physics we are

933
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,480
talking about so if you are

934
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
if your engineer you would you probably

935
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
will hear

936
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,440
your basic electricity costs there's a

937
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
current kirchhoff's law current law

938
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
which means all currents entering one

939
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
point on the electrical circuit

940
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,200
shall

941
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,320
sum to zero so what comes in moscow

942
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,280
if there's no storage of electrons

943
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,839
two there's a kirchhoff's voltage law it

944
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,240
means if you go around any loop in the

945
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
electrical network and find the voltage

946
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,000
drops along every line every link and

947
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,680
add them together

948
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,240
it shall be zero that's what physics

949
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,560
says and ohm's law says

950
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,200
if you look at every uh power line they

951
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
haven't resistance and impedance and

952
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,440
the voltage drop should be proportional

953
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,599
to the current going through that and

954
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,160
that proportional constant is that

955
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
impedance or

956
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
resistance and reactance of that line so

957
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,400
these are physics they can they have to

958
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,440
be met and so what it means here is okay

959
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,119
fine if we know that

960
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,680
then in the substation i'm going to

961
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
i'm going to collect the data from

962
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,520
substation and i'm going to share data

963
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
among substations

964
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,000
and so there is a protocol

965
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,320
communication protocol which allow you

966
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,359
to bring data from other substations and

967
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,240
if i can take the substation data and do

968
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,480
my analysis and if you don't meet the

969
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
law of physics i know this is fake so

970
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,839
that's a simple idea

971
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,000
that electrical engineers would

972
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,200
appreciate

973
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,400
and so

974
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
and

975
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
and you can argue of course i can

976
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,359
fake the measurement in such a way that

977
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
they still meet the law of physics but

978
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,359
then the attacker will be very

979
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:06,320
sophisticated

980
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,599
and and also it it is still questionable

981
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,640
whether that can be done practically

982
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
all right so

983
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
let me quickly mention um

984
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,960
i'm a little bit out of time but i can

985
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,320
give you an example here

986
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,760
so here is a

987
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,280
here is the the renewable energy so i'm

988
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,520
i'm trying to say there are pve

989
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,079
facilities solar facilities

990
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,720
and today we have a lot of them

991
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,560
right outside my window there's a few

992
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,359
hundred kilowatt solar sitting on top of

993
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,400
the parking lot in virginia tech we have

994
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,599
a couple million megawatt solar panels

995
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,119
that's that's

996
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,320
being

997
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
added

998
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,280
around campus

999
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,599
and so the question here is can i attack

1000
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,240
these pv facilities because the pv

1001
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
facilities are generated it's just

1002
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,960
different type so if i attack these

1003
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,920
solar facilities a few megawatts would

1004
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,560
mean i lose a few megawatt of generation

1005
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,240
so what does that mean

1006
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,560
and so how how would that happen

1007
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,599
so the question is yes it's par it's

1008
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,640
possible it's it's not easy but if you

1009
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,480
monitor the i.t

1010
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,720
the i.t

1011
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,880
activities

1012
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,680
associated with that monitoring of that

1013
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,640
solar facility then you see there's

1014
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
someone trying to connect

1015
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,839
and

1016
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,000
heavy network traffic

1017
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,960
and the processor the processor of the

1018
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,320
the it is down performance is down

1019
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
because very busy such as denying the

1020
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,640
service effect

1021
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
and then you conclude maybe there's a

1022
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,400
flooding attack so you build a

1023
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
dictionary

1024
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
and then you observe the activities and

1025
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
substation and you'll be able to find

1026
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
what's happening

1027
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,800
and what's the real impact we can this

1028
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
is the testbed we have here at virginia

1029
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,800
tech you can you can have an it

1030
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,119
communication system and power system

1031
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,680
simulation and that will allow you to

1032
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
figure out what's the impact for example

1033
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
this this says

1034
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,640
uh if you lose a power converter if you

1035
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
lose a solar

1036
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,880
facility you also lose a smart inverter

1037
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,400
control capability

1038
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
and so the voltage profile of that

1039
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,599
distribution grid will suffer and this

1040
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,640
means the voltage profile along the

1041
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,200
along the geographic

1042
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,920
distribution feeder that voltage profile

1043
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
would drop

1044
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,839
and this is what that picture means

1045
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,240
so i i think i will uh give you one

1046
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,440
given that i have 30 to 31 seconds

1047
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,240
i was i would just mention uh in the

1048
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,079
distribution level what we want to

1049
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,200
achieve is every node will become an

1050
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,880
intelligent agent

1051
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,760
all right

1052
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,079
and every the nodes will be able to

1053
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,720
share information so if one node is

1054
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
attacked

1055
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,000
they will share information so the other

1056
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,599
node will be informed and somehow by by

1057
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,240
working with each other teamwork i call

1058
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,040
that

1059
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,079
neighborhood watch system and so these

1060
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
intelligent agents will be able to work

1061
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,760
with each other

1062
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,319
and through that so if one node is

1063
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,359
attacked

1064
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,079
and i can detect it locally then i

1065
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,079
broadcast to the neighborhood

1066
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,880
and the neighborhood will see how likely

1067
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,839
am i going to be attacked the next step

1068
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,880
if it appears that this the feature that

1069
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,200
my features are very similar to the last

1070
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,839
one then i might have to lock down

1071
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,079
communication or restrict the

1072
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
communication so i will not be the next

1073
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,640
victim of this

1074
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,040
and so this is an interesting concept

1075
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,359
because that that does mean the power

1076
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
grid will be smarter and we have this

1077
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
multi-agent system and they share

1078
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
information share intelligence

1079
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,319
and for the common good protecting

1080
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,599
making the power grid more secure and

1081
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,200
avoid the

1082
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,480
outages

1083
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,720
so

1084
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,000
i think i ran out of time but uh i want

1085
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
to conclude that

1086
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,880
i think what's interesting here is we no

1087
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,359
longer study a traditional power grid

1088
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,440
now we have to look at power grid as a

1089
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,000
cyber physical system and that's why the

1090
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,960
title of my presentation is not cyber

1091
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,359
security of a power grid it's cyber

1092
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,800
physical system security of outbreak

1093
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,720
so with that

1094
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,440
let's see if we have time for questions

1095
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,640
i do see

1096
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
there's something in the chat

1097
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,839
so

1098
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,240
if you have any question please uh send

1099
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,960
it in the q a or

1100
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
the chat

1101
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
so

1102
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,839
journey i'm back to you

1103
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,640
yes thank you so so seriously so for all

1104
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,160
the attendees if you have a question

1105
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,599
oh

1106
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,560
yeah

1107
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,680
so okay they allow me to open the window

1108
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,839
so

1109
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,240
uh someone

1110
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,160
paul i can read a question for you but

1111
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,240
for others please type the question into

1112
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
the q a

1113
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,520
so

1114
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,560
um

1115
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,640
professor would you want actually have

1116
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,119
two questions but you you want to answer

1117
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,000
the

1118
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
does one question pop up in the q a i

1119
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
see this one on the chat box so make can

1120
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
i start with this one yeah if you want

1121
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
i'm supposed to file

1122
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
i plan to actually ask paul to pose a

1123
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,400
question to clean air but it's okay it's

1124
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,760
up to you

1125
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,599
let me start with this one on the chat

1126
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,480
box

1127
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800
it says the transmission system operator

1128
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,079
is not likely to act on a single fake

1129
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,720
measurement because their state estimate

1130
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,079
estimator will flag data as problematic

1131
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,839
if you thought about leveraging the

1132
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,240
energy management system state estimator

1133
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,119
for your measurement intrusion detection

1134
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,079
system

1135
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,079
so this is a very good question because

1136
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,880
it does it does show the importance

1137
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,680
differentiating between cyber system and

1138
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,240
power system and the reason i said that

1139
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,200
is when i see there's an attack from the

1140
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,880
state estimation

1141
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,280
i this attack already

1142
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,839
already started from the substation

1143
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,000
arrive at the control center

1144
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,880
pass that software of state estimator

1145
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,560
and show you there's a problem but

1146
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,920
that's too late

1147
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,880
because

1148
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
because that data already get to the

1149
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,520
control center and if it's a raw data

1150
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,560
the operators already saw that

1151
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,599
because the operator saw the raw data on

1152
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,560
the screen and if they are going to

1153
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
react to the raw data

1154
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
it might have already happened

1155
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,800
and so we cannot rely on the state

1156
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
estimation is good because it will help

1157
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,560
you improve the quality of further

1158
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,520
further security analysis of power

1159
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,599
but it will not be able to help the

1160
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,839
operator in mitigate a an ongoing attack

1161
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,560
or an attack that has not been processed

1162
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,800
by energy management system

1163
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,079
so i hope that answer this question

1164
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,119
there's another one uh q a

1165
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,440
um

1166
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,800
so there's a question from doc wrap

1167
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,280
what do you believe is the first step to

1168
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,440
securing the grid

1169
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,599
that's a very general question but also

1170
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,160
excellent question because uh

1171
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,400
um

1172
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,599
okay so

1173
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,040
so um what's the first step i would say

1174
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,280
you know in the power grid

1175
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
because the power grid has been there

1176
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,319
for

1177
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,880
more than 100 years as i said

1178
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,240
and

1179
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,640
we can run the power grid even without

1180
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
radio

1181
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
so 100 years ago imagine

1182
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,119
where is there's very little

1183
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,440
communication and maybe the phone was

1184
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,720
just in

1185
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,560
just being invented

1186
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
yet the power grid was running in a

1187
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,839
local level

1188
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,200
and so we know how to run the power grid

1189
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
with minimum communication

1190
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,839
but the question now is that

1191
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,800
we have added so much of the

1192
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
information and communication technology

1193
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,079
that the vulnerabilities has increased

1194
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,040
and so

1195
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,319
so and so what i'm trying to say is at

1196
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,760
this at the

1197
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,359
at the time we were adding this ict uh

1198
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,200
communication i.t

1199
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,079
uh

1200
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,160
all this new technology we call that

1201
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,119
smart grid or whatever resilient grid we

1202
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,680
are adding all these technologies

1203
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,720
but then the power grid itself it wasn't

1204
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,680
there was no concept of cyber security

1205
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,480
when we put the power grid together

1206
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
and and it operates for more than 100

1207
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,839
years ago so there's a lot of

1208
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,400
vulnerabilities that has to be that has

1209
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,359
to be

1210
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,800
plugged

1211
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,079
there because

1212
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,000
today all components

1213
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,560
you know all the even power components

1214
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,440
we're adding they become connected uh to

1215
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,599
the network and so

1216
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,440
so everything we are adding sort of

1217
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,040
added to that connectivity but are we is

1218
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,920
that secured and so i think as we add

1219
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,040
the ict while we look at the new tech

1220
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,599
new iep technology and the old power

1221
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,880
grid and make sure that that integration

1222
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,680
will consider the old power grid and

1223
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,839
make sure it's secure i think that is a

1224
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,920
gap that we have to bridge

1225
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,800
first

1226
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
and of course we are adding all these

1227
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,680
firewalls and encryptions and many other

1228
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,800
things that

1229
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,400
cyber security

1230
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,800
area is adding for that technology so we

1231
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,079
have a ketchup but i as i said the big

1232
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,079
gap is that we have a power grid that's

1233
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,319
running for 100 years and how do you

1234
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,079
make sure that it would be secured

1235
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,400
from attack from the cyber flavor and

1236
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,200
that

1237
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,040
is a less understood question

1238
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,720
um actually well i i will have one

1239
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,000
question because

1240
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,920
you know so can i ask one question i

1241
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,599
thought we are kind of long of time but

1242
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,880
you know

1243
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,960
uh

1244
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,599
someone else has a question

1245
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,599
would you want to call me professor

1246
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,440
professor ashley new would you want to

1247
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
take a look about the chat

1248
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,640
because some

1249
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,079
poor

1250
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,160
cousin comments i don't know if you want

1251
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,400
to comment that

1252
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,920
um

1253
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,720
sure

1254
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,599
so

1255
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,160
uh the comment says i'm sorry you have

1256
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,558
to disagree operators concerned with

1257
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,200
can you hear me

1258
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,599
yes we can hear you yeah operators

1259
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,520
concerned with reliability tend to

1260
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,680
operate off of the

1261
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,079
ems sc non-raw data and pmu linear state

1262
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,920
estimator is improving situation

1263
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,520
awareness i agree but i'm also saying in

1264
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,359
some control centers

1265
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,720
that operate operators see the raw data

1266
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,880
and the state estimation results it

1267
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,960
feeds the security analysis

1268
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,400
and so even but my point does not change

1269
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,599
which is

1270
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,480
if you want to stop the cyber attack

1271
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,240
we have to go to the source and the

1272
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,920
source is

1273
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,480
a big part of the attack source coming

1274
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,280
from substation so if you can stop the

1275
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,319
attack from the substation then stop it

1276
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,079
there before it's sent to the control

1277
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,760
center so that is the general idea i'm

1278
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
trying to convey of course the attack

1279
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,920
could be directed towards the control

1280
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,559
center uh by itself

1281
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,440
and that then this question will be

1282
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
but then when you attack the control

1283
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,599
center it might attack it might attack

1284
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,880
the

1285
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,440
software there or the i t within the

1286
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,319
control center and so it's not the

1287
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,760
measurement that comes from the

1288
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,520
substation that's being attacked so

1289
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,800
that's a different category

1290
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,000
i hope that

1291
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,119
we are kind of around the time but i

1292
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,000
have very quick questions so you want to

1293
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,280
comment that so i i i think in the power

1294
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,520
grid two different is very important is

1295
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,240
when we talk about text but to our

1296
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,040
knowledge actually attack is quite real

1297
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
at least it's not that so common right

1298
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,200
now so it's more actually more important

1299
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
it's about the reliability or resilience

1300
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,599
as you mentioned you are in your in your

1301
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,839
talk so what you wonder can we actually

1302
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,640
extend from the

1303
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
cyber attack

1304
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,520
to the residence of the system to

1305
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,640
enhance the ability of the power grid to

1306
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,119
flex a normal anomaly detection or

1307
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,920
something else instead of just to look

1308
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,480
at actually this attack from outside or

1309
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,079
inside yeah there's a there is an area

1310
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,800
in the power grid that's that's normally

1311
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
called cascading events

1312
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,559
and that cascading event is it's

1313
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,240
known for

1314
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,119
maybe

1315
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,880
10 and from about 2000 so 20 years

1316
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,200
and so people defend technology people

1317
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,599
develop technologies called defense

1318
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,680
system trying to protect that power

1319
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,720
system

1320
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,079
and that that um cascading events at

1321
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,280
that point as i said it was more about

1322
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,559
the weather-based events or intentional

1323
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,440
attack by intentional attack at that

1324
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,520
point it was less of a cyber attack

1325
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,240
because 20 years ago there's not much

1326
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,960
research about cyber attack and power

1327
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,480
and so that is the new component of that

1328
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,440
of that range of attack that we have to

1329
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,359
address and that is the new

1330
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,200
and that's the new class of attack that

1331
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,920
we have to be able to

1332
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
protect against and i think that's what

1333
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,800
you

1334
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,079
are saying and

1335
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,640
and what i have shown here is how do we

1336
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,640
do that that's the question right

1337
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
well because the nature of the attack is

1338
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,160
cyber

1339
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,480
and it's integrated cyber and physical

1340
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,720
system so we have to have the tool to do

1341
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,960
the study we have the technology to try

1342
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,280
to mitigate that and that's why talk

1343
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,359
about this intel this intrusion

1344
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,000
detection all this integrated cyber

1345
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,440
physical system

1346
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,880
uh security technology

1347
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,480
yeah that's why you know it's not tech

1348
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,240
you have the test bed right you have

1349
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,079
this simulator which

1350
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,880
makes this research possible

1351
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,280
it's all software though so it's it's a

1352
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,640
it's about

1353
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
you know it's very in the power business

1354
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,960
it's very hard to have hardware test

1355
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,680
back because you have to buy a real

1356
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,000
scale you have to buy a

1357
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
hardware component that's very hard

1358
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,119
because

1359
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,480
research lab

1360
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,040
is very hard to handle that and so most

1361
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
of our testbed is software but

1362
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,800
fortunately we can get the right

1363
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,920
protocol

1364
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,040
and and right power system simulation

1365
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,760
and build our own cyber system model and

1366
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,559
that

1367
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,359
allow us to do such study so that's not

1368
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,599
too bad so the real work is

1369
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,319
to be able to develop a cyber system

1370
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,319
model and being able to integrate and

1371
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,760
actually i teach a

1372
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,880
course

1373
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,000
on this

1374
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,480
so i give the students

1375
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,559
a cyber system model

1376
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,640
and they they know how to find a power

1377
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,200
system model and the work is trying to

1378
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,040
integrate that and do what i'm saying

1379
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,200
and develop something good and many

1380
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,400
students actually uh finish the course

1381
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,280
and publish papers all of them

1382
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,319
oh that's great yeah but i think it's a

1383
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,960
good experience for them

1384
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,000
yeah

1385
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
it's perfect actually for the students

1386
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,000
actually you know they can do something

1387
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
at the campus before they actually get

1388
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,880
to the real right the job the the job

1389
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,559
and they'll they'll

1390
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,000
go to their work

1391
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,599
we have students coming from the

1392
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,319
computer engineering side also they

1393
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,720
don't know much about power grid but

1394
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,839
but uh

1395
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,079
but the the power grid has very well

1396
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,480
established simulator so they can use it

1397
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,880
as a as a black box

1398
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,359
and trying to figure out a better way to

1399
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,160
do a cyber security protection

1400
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,960
yeah and uh as one of the most important

1401
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,760
action

1402
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,680
cyber physical system i think a power

1403
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,160
grid and this test bed and this

1404
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,559
simulator it's very important for people

1405
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,760
to do that

1406
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,640
yeah

1407
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,920
and

1408
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
i think you know professor because we

1409
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,319
are kind of run out of time so we are

1410
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,880
going to kind of stop here

1411
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,599
and uh we're really really appreciating

1412
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,599
you're coming to give us this kind of a

1413
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,599
talk and that's a great action for

1414
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,680
people to especially actually a lot of

1415
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,599
people are interested in the cbs we do

1416
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,960
not have too much background about the

1417
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,799
power grid that's where we learn a lot

1418
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,480
so really appreciate that thank you very

1419
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,680
much

1420
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,400
my pleasure i hope next time i will be

1421
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,640
visiting the campus and meet some of you

1422
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,440
so of course and we were on your actual

1423
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,400
dinner for sure

1424
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
yeah great excellent well take the rain

1425
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,200
check for dinner

1426
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,000
yeah of course of course and uh thank

1427
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,599
you for everybody for coming actually to

1428
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,480
this talk and we will see you next

1429
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,480
wednesday afternoon

1430
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,440
