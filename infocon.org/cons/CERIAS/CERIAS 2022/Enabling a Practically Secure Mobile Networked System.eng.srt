1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,480
okay i think let's guess that

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,280
so

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,319
hello everyone so welcome back to our

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,440
you know the weekly services seminar and

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
uh today i'm very happy actually to

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
uh introduce actually the professor too

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,440
he is action professor in the michigan

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
uh michigan state university he actually

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,279
is expert in mobile network security

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320
and um in the past 10 years he has done

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
his research from 4g security of course

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
right now to fight his security

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
so today uh he of course he has a lot of

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,559
actually you know the very exciting work

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
his main shows actually in the real

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
attacks actually in the commercial

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,559
action the u.s network like atnt verizon

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,760
t-mobile

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
and the shows action where we are

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,879
unfortunately we are vulnerable to

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,760
um

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,719
a lot of actions threat and attacks of

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
course they also give us the solution

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
and the recommendation to this operator

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
which kind of action secured our today's

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,119
network from from millions of people

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,080
okay

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
and um i think today he's going to talk

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,640
about actually his research about how to

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
secure mobile networks so i will give

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,479
the 10 to professor chu so

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
scott are you ready

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
oh yes okay uh thank you for the kind

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
introduction i'm an uh first uh

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,799
professor at the michigan state

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,159
university

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,720
and i have uh actually i i had the

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
professor pong graduated from the same

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,759
research

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
at ucla and we have been working in this

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,200
primary scenario research area mobile

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
network security for many years

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
yeah we together discover lots of

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
interesting security vulnerabilities and

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
findings and we also collect closely

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,799
collaborated with operators and the

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
device manufacturers such as google

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
and we work together and help them to

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
help them fix a lot of our abilities now

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,119
in today's talk i'd like to share with

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,520
you some of my research experience how

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
we identify those okay uh real world uh

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
security threats and how can we

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,200
okay uh deal with that okay

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,920
so let's talk the title is enabling a

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,319
practically a secure mobile network

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
system

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
okay

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
so the world has been uh mobilized in

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,720
the 2021 and mobile nails have

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,200
connected more than 15 billion mobile

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,920
devices okay provided uh

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,760
okay the fifth uh 5.3 billion users with

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
a ubiquitous uh emerging uh

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
mobile services including like okay the

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160
ultra reliable of latency communication

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
industry iot communication and the

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,319
virtual reality

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,120
however it never be an easy task to

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
secure operational mobile networks that

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
come with some reasons first of all the

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,879
serial number is a typical effect

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
indeed a complicated system it's

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
supposed to okay usually compress more

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
than okay the tensor never functions our

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,519
elements and support more than 30

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
different particles

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
and the most challenging part is okay in

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
operational

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
a networks he needed to simultaneously

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
support multiple generations of mobile

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
networks

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
for example an atm user you can freely

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
switch between the 3g umts 4g lt and the

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,400
5g non new radio without terminating

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
your ongoing services such as ufos data

87
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,959
and

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,840
test services okay however the problem

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
is that okay the

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
in the different generations of the

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,159
mobile names their security magazine and

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,280
their services vary with a lot okay for

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,239
example in the 3g unts they only support

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,560
a circuit search fast okay voice and the

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
test services however in the 5g and the

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
4g they support a circuit package search

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
base

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
of voice and test services

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
here is an example okay basically yeah

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
you may think that this name

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
architecture is sort of complicated but

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
actually it's a reality

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
actually in atm d for example in antenna

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,478
verizon let's support both okay 3g 4g

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,279
and the 5g networks so they allow the

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
user can switch between multiple

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
generations of mobile nails which means

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,960
that if

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
anyone even lay out any vulnerabilities

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
in a particular component they can

111
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
threaten all the mobile users no matter

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
you are using a 4g of 5g it doesn't

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
matter even okay the label element in

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
the 3g has some problem they can thread

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
the robotic user because they you can

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
switch between the multiple generations

117
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
of mobile networks

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,479
so

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
yeah we can see because the cellular

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
operational cell name is a complicated

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
assistant so basically it's technology

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
challenges to discover all the possible

123
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,280
success abilities in this arca the

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
hybrid network means they support

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
multiple generations of

126
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
neighbors no matter we are using okay

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,919
the formal messages or using the

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
empirical approaches it's not easy to do

129
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,039
so

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,759
so

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
our approach is that we take a service

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
oriented approach we try to i we try to

133
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,560
study the insecurity of essential okay

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
mobile services such as voice test data

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
iot or emerging c services okay our goal

136
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
is to identify the practical security

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
threats against the mobile ecosystem is

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
not limited to the mobile users only but

139
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,720
also okay the mobile operators and the

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,440
okay applications rely on the mobile

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
systems okay

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,720
and our text that okay now our tech

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,639
we're not limit it to okay for example

144
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
at the better you must be the nearby of

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
the arabic chain actually

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,000
uh in our uh in our words our textbook

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
can be used to launch remote attacks

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
against the mobile users yeah i'll

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,560
provide more details later

150
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,039
now using this approach in the last 10

151
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
years and we have discovered lots of

152
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
interesting survival abilities in a

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,039
different

154
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,560
services including the iot service voice

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
test and the data services

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
in the iot service

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
in iot service security we find okay

158
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
adversary they can remotely discover the

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
ip addresses and the phone numbers

160
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
assigned to the massive

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
cellular iot devices since it's also

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
massive cellular device is only

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
subscribed to a small amount of data

164
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
okay so if layer id addresses and the

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
phone numbers can be identified by

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,160
adversary they will suffer from okay the

167
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
analysis attack because at the base we

168
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,919
can send

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,560
a spamming package to those iot devices

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,039
and concern their subscriber data among

171
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
quickly okay

172
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
and in the voice

173
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
service okay we find it by a given phone

174
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
number and the rest of it can remotely

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,479
launch

176
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,080
either data eos attack or voice the nav

177
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
service attacks and even more

178
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
threatening and a diversity can obtain

179
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
the free data services and

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
also launch over billing attacks against

181
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,599
any mobile devices

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,319
yeah and the in the test security

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
service we find okay

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,440
adventurously can donate money on behalf

185
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
of the victim without their product

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
consent okay and they can help you to

187
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,400
okay they can hijack your facebook

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
accounts without your username and

189
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
password okay

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
so yeah in the data security we find

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
okay adversary can remotely increase the

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
victories monthly bill to a large extent

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
and the victims will be totally unaware

194
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
of those attacks okay return you need to

195
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
pay for those of the unwanted package

196
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,000
that they you never received okay

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
and uh yeah so due to the tiny

198
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
invitations in today's talk i will many

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
introduce

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
indeed to introduce our work in the

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
category of our voice service security

202
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
now while i choose the

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
voice service uh

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
security in today's token the reason is

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,960
actually it is a real security threat

206
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
the reason is that for all the

207
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
smartphones

208
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
non-limited smartphone for all the

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
mobile phones they have a pre-installer

210
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,958
serial network voice services if you

211
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,120
don't you cannot obtain a 3gpp

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
certification which means you cannot be

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,479
on the market

214
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
which means if there are any

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
vulnerabilities in the serial network

216
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
services they can lead it to a

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
investigating a consequence on global

218
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,800
scale

219
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
more than bidding the mobile user will

220
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
suffer from this attacks so let's apply

221
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
choose this operator topic in the

222
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
desktop

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
yeah let's go to the mobile network

224
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
voice service security okay so before i

225
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
introduce the

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,279
interest findings that we discover i'd

227
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
like to share okay the

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,880
one deep uh integrand design principle

229
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
you can find this design principle in

230
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
all generations of our mobile networks

231
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
let's voice first yes you are right it's

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
voice first it never be the data first

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
you can find this desired principle in

234
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,279
all generations of mobile names

235
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
which yeah from the from first

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
generation to the fifth generation yeah

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
it does not come without any good reason

238
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
because in the first generation of a

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
mobile network it's designed to provide

240
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
users with a ubiquitous avoid services

241
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,279
so his job his goal is to provide a user

242
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
with a character and a voice quality

243
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
to achieve this goal

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
you can find less than nothing that

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
cannot be sacrified

246
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
okay in the founding covenants that i

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
can provide you the three examples you

248
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
can see

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
what i'm talking about okay

250
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,120
yeah this this table is a

251
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
qrs the class the qs classifier

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
identifier

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
for all the services for example like

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,279
data voice vehicle to uh we go to legal

255
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
communication we can do everything push

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
to talk okay

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,399
they provide they will define the

258
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,279
priority labels for all kinds of

259
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
services in the serial network okay

260
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
let's check where the voice is

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,959
this is our okay voice packing it's

262
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,600
assigned priority of two

263
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
lower value means a higher priority okay

264
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,040
the

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,440
highest part is one okay the lowest is

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
uh two oh sorry the second highest is at

267
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,519
two okay

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,800
and here is a voice signaling message

269
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
to transmit the voice signaling message

270
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
his priority is assigned

271
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,040
one which means the highest priority in

272
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
the cellular nails

273
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
compared with the voice package and the

274
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,680
more signals where is our internet

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,440
traffic

276
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
our internet traffic is right here

277
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
you'll be assigned

278
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
priority ranges from a to nine which is

279
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
much lower than the voice package and

280
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
the voice signal is what you mean if you

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
only have a limited resources and all

282
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
the limited resources will be used to

283
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,920
sever our voice packet and a voice

284
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,720
signal rather than our internet traffic

285
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
so let's say

286
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
why i say okay the serial number is

287
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
always a false first name rather than

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
data first okay now of course the

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,000
different people may have a different

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
opinion but here is a okay the qos

291
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,279
classifier identified table you can take

292
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
a look at this table

293
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
okay

294
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
and the last example is that okay

295
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,480
in the 4g and the 5g name was all the

296
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
voice

297
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
are provided over the ip which means

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
that we leverage the cpu session

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
initiation protocol to provide a user

300
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
with a voice services

301
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
okay compare

302
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
before i talk before i'm in

303
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
for the reserve resources before running

304
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
means let me introduce the nonserious

305
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
super code flow first

306
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
now this is a non-cellular supercall

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
flow we can see this cover from internet

308
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,279
it's pretty common okay alice try to

309
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,920
call bob allen was said invited to the

310
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
super head uh civ server and the civil

311
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
servant was saying 100 trying back to

312
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
the ads say okay i already i will have

313
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
to find out where the bob is okay after

314
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
the serial server find the bar

315
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,639
and the shift server will forward let's

316
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
see invite to bob then barbara's phone

317
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
rings okay then bubble was sent 180

318
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,240
running back to the alice

319
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,040
after alice received a 180 ringing and

320
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
the alex phone will play a lot in tone

321
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,160
okay then after bob answered the call

322
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
and the bob's device was sending 200

323
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
okay which means answers back to the

324
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
alice then they can these two guys can

325
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
have their voice conversation and after

326
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
the call is finished okay alex can send

327
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,720
a buy to the bob and bob send 200 okay

328
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
back to the address

329
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
now let's take a look at how the 4g and

330
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
the 5g network modify this long cellular

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,120
civic code cover

332
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,680
so i already highlighted okay the

333
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
multiplication you've been the blue

334
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
color okay now we can see

335
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
after the bible receive a civil invite

336
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
he will send his phone

337
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
does not start to read

338
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,680
instead

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
his phone sends 183 session progress

340
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,560
back to the alex

341
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,199
actually in a simple invite the caller

342
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,360
will specify the supported audio cortex

343
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
in the field invite then call it you

344
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
need to select one from ros

345
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,880
cortex right so in a 183 session

346
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,959
progress the bubble was specified the

347
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,160
selected

348
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
the audio deck the setting all take a

349
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
represent okay the the qos okay for

350
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,680
example like a uplink and downlink a

351
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,240
bandwidth specifically may require a 30

352
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,839
kbps okay

353
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,800
then

354
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,440
plus the sip

355
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
session progress magic will be sent to

356
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
the ads then alice will base on the

357
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
selected audio code and go to reserve

358
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
resources okay after resource has been

359
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
reserved

360
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
and alice will send a proportional act

361
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,560
prx back to the bob okay

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,399
after bob finished the research

363
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
reservation and received the probation

364
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,720
egg from the alice the box phone

365
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
starts to ring

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
which means before chorus phone rings

367
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
all the resources required for this

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,399
co-conversation have been reserved okay

369
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,639
so this is something okay the

370
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,920
serial nails did additionally to protect

371
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,720
to provide a user with a carrier grant

372
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
okay voice quality we make sure all the

373
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
resources have been reserved then we

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,519
make the corresponding ring

375
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
then the third example is that okay

376
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,120
if a layer is a intersection handover

377
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
okay the user switch it from the whole g

378
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
to 3g or switching from 3g to 4g okay

379
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
when this indecision occurred okay the

380
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,279
voice services will be always

381
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,160
resumed first okay will be earlier than

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
the data services

383
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
yeah here your example okay we assume we

384
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
have a two okay

385
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,839
in the voice and the the data services

386
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
session okay then we suffer from okay

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
the then we experience uh

388
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
inter system surgery from the four g to

389
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
the five g that's right from 4g to the

390
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,639
3g

391
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
then we can find the voice service is

392
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
available

393
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
much earlier than the data service

394
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,800
so fuji means that okay we can see

395
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,600
by these three examples we can see

396
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
serial names actually indeed a

397
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,440
voice-first network it's not the data

398
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,320
first network okay yeah we can see the

399
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
many designs okay they can reflect the

400
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
search design principle now it may

401
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,040
interesting why i need to introduce this

402
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
desired principle let me tell you by

403
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,560
leveraging this simple desired principle

404
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
we already discovered lots of

405
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
interesting vulnerabilities let me

406
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,639
introduce it one by one okay

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
here are the list of the voice solutions

408
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,360
in the fortune of 5g okay let me

409
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,959
introduce

410
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,160
first okay

411
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,120
in the 4g lt uh in the 4glt there are

412
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
three voice solutions first is a

413
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
circuitry fallback csfv the 3d solution

414
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
focus

415
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,519
means that

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
for a 4g user when you try to access

417
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
voice services you will be switched back

418
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
to a legacy 3g system first then you

419
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
access the 3g circuit switch voice

420
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,160
services

421
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
after your circuit search code is

422
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
finished you'll be switched back to the

423
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,039
4g system okay let's say that how does

424
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
this fallback works okay

425
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,240
then

426
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
in the 4g lte also support a voltage

427
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
services voice over lte

428
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
to support actually voiceover t is

429
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
similar to the voice over the ip

430
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,120
the operator deployer ims ip multimedia

431
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,559
subsistence in his core network okay

432
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,120
the ims system ims system comprised la

433
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,400
compries a lot of lots of ship servers

434
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,799
and the signaling okay the gateway they

435
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,280
can convert the zip signal into the okay

436
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,320
i suck

437
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
the the secret message used in the

438
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
telephoning networks okay by

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
the ims okay the

440
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,039
when the 4g volte user access the voice

441
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
services they will not be switched to

442
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,919
the 3g system they can directly use the

443
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,919
voice service in the 4g network

444
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,720
and for 4g user they can also use a

445
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
voice over the wi-fi yeah which means

446
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,160
that you can access you okay the serial

447
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
number voice services through the public

448
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,039
or private wi-fi the civ server are

449
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,720
still those in the ims system ip mode

450
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,520
media subsystem deployed by operator you

451
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
still share the same servers with the

452
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,679
volte server with volte users however

453
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,919
you access them through the public wi-fi

454
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
or private wi-fi

455
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
and in the 5g new radio okay he supports

456
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
three voice solutions

457
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
eps fallback eps stands for

458
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
involved packet assistant okay so the

459
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
idea is that it's a similar to the cs4

460
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
back

461
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,760
basically it's used for those uh

462
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,640
non-stand along the 5g deployment

463
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,120
non-state of non-fighter department

464
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
i've already do not deploy the 5g corner

465
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,360
but still rely on the 4g core level i've

466
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
already only deployed the 5g base

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
stations okay

468
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
and for such okay operator when their

469
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
user when their 5g user try to answer

470
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
more services those users will be

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
switched to the 4g system first then

472
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
they can access the volte services in

473
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,559
the 4g and after they finish the voice

474
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,559
services they will be switched back to

475
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
the 5g system okay similar to the cs4

476
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,280
back okay

477
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,080
and the lavio are not voice overly new

478
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,440
radio yeah

479
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
it's for the non is for the stand alone

480
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
5g deployment which means operators

481
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
deploy the 5g code now and they also

482
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,720
deploy the ims ip mod media subsystem so

483
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
that the follower was an art user when

484
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
they access the voice services they will

485
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,679
not be switched to the 4g system they

486
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,160
can just stay in the 5g and access their

487
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,679
voice services

488
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,840
yeah the 5g user they can also use the

489
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
voice over the wi-fi okay

490
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
now

491
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
our finding shows actually for almost

492
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
all the voice solutions we can launch

493
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
the attacks against it

494
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,039
for the 4g cs4 pack by giving a phone

495
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,600
number we can launch the data in office

496
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
attack we can suffocate the newer data

497
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,520
services

498
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,559
and then for more services okay user we

499
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,600
can launch the data or voice dynamics

500
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,720
attack

501
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,360
and the user can take advantage of

502
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
operators they can obtain a free data

503
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
service with the highest service

504
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
priority in a cellular network they can

505
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
launch over billing attack which means

506
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,200
uh okay buy a given okay the ib address

507
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
of the mobile device

508
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,159
advisor can increase increase his of the

509
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,640
muscle bio to largest 10 and up and

510
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
adversary don't need to pay for those

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,880
okay data spent

512
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,120
if you are using the okay voice okay

513
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
over the wi-fi you are suffering from

514
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
the voice dos attacks okay

515
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
and yeah

516
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
in the 5g and now we currently are

517
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,919
verifying okay the voice uh denies

518
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,120
attack for the voice over the over our

519
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,919
new radio users okay and we already

520
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
verified the voice uh in our first

521
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
attack can be applied to the okay the 5g

522
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,280
user when using the voice over wi-fi

523
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
okay

524
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,159
so in a bonus slides and i will

525
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,200
introduce how we make it okay

526
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
so this is uh the

527
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
incoming call code flow follow cs 4g cs

528
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
fallback user okay

529
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
yeah when uh

530
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,159
let's see okay

531
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
when uh okay when it's coming code to

532
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,039
the uh cs4 back user the call request

533
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,919
will be sent to the 3g cs okay gateway

534
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,799
first

535
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,640
then through gcs game will send a page

536
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
in request to 4g mmb

537
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,400
4g mme is uh okay uh is responsible for

538
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
okay authenticating the users and the

539
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
manager user location and the manager

540
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
organization management uh including

541
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
like a qrs upper 10 ip address okay

542
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
so the the 4g mme after you receive a

543
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,799
patron request from the 3g cs gateway

544
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,039
thus 4g mne will send a patron request

545
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
to the 4g uh cs4 packet user and he will

546
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
specify why the reason why i need to

547
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
page you the reason is okay let's

548
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,880
incoming cs code

549
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
then the user you will send the extended

550
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,559
service request fed to the 4g mmb

551
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,640
then 4g mme will send the initial ue con

552
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,760
contact setup to the 4g backstage then

553
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
4g based station was search the user

554
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,159
from a 4g to a 3g

555
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,000
system

556
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
after the user connect to the 3g back

557
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,360
station the user will send a paging

558
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
response to the 3g

559
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
circuit search gateway then you go to

560
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,360
exception uscs code after that you

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
perform the package switch handover

562
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,919
execution

563
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
which means uh we establish cs after the

564
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
user

565
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,200
switch to the 3g system

566
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,320
he will establish cs code first

567
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
earlier than okay the

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,440
resume layer okay he's okay data

569
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,120
services okay

570
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
now after the call is finished

571
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
and the after the alice receiver code

572
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
releases he'll be switched to the 4g

573
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
system

574
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,120
now let's take a look at how the code

575
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
affects the data

576
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,679
so

577
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,960
we can see

578
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
the data suspension will occur at the

579
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,799
inter-system surgery between the 4g and

580
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,320
the 3g yeah we can see there two

581
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
data suspension here but each data

582
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,360
suspension will last for a few seconds

583
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,559
yeah why the reason is that okay

584
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,640
the device will establish its code first

585
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
then they go to resume layer data

586
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
services so that's why we can see

587
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
there are some okay there are there's

588
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,880
some uh data suspension they occur when

589
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
the intersection handover occurs

590
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,240
now

591
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
the idea is okay if we know

592
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,720
intersections which

593
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
can lead to

594
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
data suspension

595
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,880
because adversary okay keep a dino code

596
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,039
to the victim and hang out the code

597
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
immediately so that we can make the

598
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,679
victim switch between the frigid and the

599
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,840
photo system back and forth right

600
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,480
ideally we can do that okay we just keep

601
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
a dining call and hang out a call and

602
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,799
use your switch back between the 3g and

603
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,960
the 4g system back and forth

604
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
then

605
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,799
our experimental results show okay

606
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,200
the victim the tcp throughput can be

607
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
reduced from 30 megabit per second to

608
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,080
almost zero within the 75 seconds okay

609
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,559
now you may wondering okay

610
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,520
if adversary okay keep assigning a call

611
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
to the victims they can definitely be

612
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
aware of this attack right because

613
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,279
vector's phone will play a ringing

614
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
tongue right so if a leviton suffer from

615
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
this attack they can definitely aware of

616
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,760
this attack right so the next step is

617
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,679
we need to upgrade

618
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,480
the they have us attack to the silent

619
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,080
the data u.s attack which means we will

620
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,039
prevent the victim's phone from running

621
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,840
how can we make it the idea is we can

622
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,799
leverage the volte and the cancel code

623
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,840
before the original app is sent

624
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
what does it mean before i introduce how

625
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,559
we make it let me introduce how a normal

626
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,679
volte

627
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,159
user dial a code to a cs4 bank user

628
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
remember that okay

629
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
so the address send the same invite to

630
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
his receipt server his single server was

631
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,400
sentenced to invite to a signaling

632
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,559
gateway the signaling game will convert

633
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,440
a sim invite into the isab message which

634
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
is iam i am stands for initial address

635
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
messaging

636
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,760
to receive a list imi message the bob

637
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
must be searched to the 3g system so

638
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,640
that they can receive this call request

639
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
okay then the signaling skateway will

640
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,559
send a 183 session progress back to the

641
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,679
alice then after alice receives message

642
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,720
alex will reserve resources and after

643
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
resource reservation is completed and

644
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
the address will send a coverage egg to

645
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,240
the synchronous gateway the secular game

646
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,440
will send a continuity message to the

647
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
bob

648
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
bob's phone template ringing tone

649
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
okay so let's say for the normal

650
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,480
procedure how the

651
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,520
the volta user called a cs4 bank user

652
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
so what if we can cancel a call before

653
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
the provisional act is sent to the

654
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,520
signaling gateway

655
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,600
then

656
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
victor's phone would never play the

657
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
ringing tone okay we cancel the code and

658
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
the signal gate was then released to the

659
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,799
box and the bubble was switched back to

660
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,600
the 4g system so that's why we are able

661
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,360
to upgrade the

662
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,918
denial says attack to the silent one

663
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
and the next i would like to introduce

664
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,960
some interest finding we discovered from

665
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,399
4g volte services actually the last five

666
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,799
uh introduced previously and in a 4g uh

667
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
volte operator deployed ip multimedia

668
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,880
subsystem in their code network so you

669
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
can see a lot of okay the cscf cscf

670
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,919
stands for call session control function

671
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,919
you can continue to learn okay uh the

672
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
civil servers they're just lots of civic

673
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
servers okay

674
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,640
and then we also have

675
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,440
some kind of signaling gateway like mgcf

676
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,760
they can help us to convert a sip

677
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
message into the isab message which is a

678
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
signaling particle used in the telephony

679
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
networks they can also convert our rtp

680
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
voice package into the voice traffic can

681
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,080
be transmitted over a temporary network

682
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,039
okay

683
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,240
the ims domain the ims ip miniature

684
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,399
system not only provide users with a

685
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,360
voice services but also provide language

686
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,159
like video code and test over the ip

687
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,480
services which means that you can send a

688
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,559
test to other people through the ims

689
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,080
now i like to highlight some differences

690
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,200
between the okay the traditional recipe

691
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
search voice services and the package

692
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,840
search best one which means ims best

693
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
services

694
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,120
the 4g lte actually provides adversary

695
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,640
with a larger attack service right

696
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,000
in the legacy one two three third

697
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
generation circuit search survey volvo

698
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,360
voice services all operations

699
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
will be performed

700
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
on the highway modem which means you can

701
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
only provide however then with

702
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
phone number and all the remaining

703
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,919
things will be handled by the howie

704
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,440
model you cannot do anything you don't

705
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
need to send any you don't need to send

706
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,000
any signal message to an investor all

707
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,159
the hardware model on this phone will

708
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,039
help you take it take care of everything

709
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,679
however in the full glt scene has been

710
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,120
changed most operations are handled by

711
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,840
the software on the phone rather than

712
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,720
hardware modem why the reason is ims is

713
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
not only designed is not designed to

714
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,880
provide the voice or test code

715
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
or test service only it can support rich

716
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
multimedia services

717
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
if operator can collaborate with a third

718
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
parties they can deploy their own

719
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,559
multimedia services

720
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,440
if they want to deploy new services they

721
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,320
cannot modify hardware more than right

722
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,159
which means that however they cannot

723
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,520
provide okay sufficient flexibility for

724
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,200
operators to support a new emerging okay

725
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,559
multimedia services so in the 4g lte the

726
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,640
most operation has been performed by

727
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,840
okay software on the

728
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,480
phone another difference is that okay

729
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,720
and the eps failure is created for the

730
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,559
voltage signaling why is uh eps barrel

731
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,679
okay

732
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,640
here is uh the simplified okay the 4g

733
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,919
lte networks we can see there is a phone

734
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,799
okay

735
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,960
and there is a base station then we have

736
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
a serving gateway and we have a pdm

737
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,039
gateway you can configure the service

738
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,799
gateway and the pico as the internet of

739
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,520
routers okay the user's packet will be

740
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
routed to the

741
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
base station and the bathroom for water

742
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,320
skateway sql4 to the pkoa and the pigway

743
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
can for the data to either internet or

744
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,159
ims

745
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,640
and the eps barrel is a

746
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,159
routing pass between the ue and the pkwa

747
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,679
the eps barrel consists of three barrels

748
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,480
one

749
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,799
radio barrel between the phone and the

750
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,080
base station

751
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,480
second s1 barrel between the base

752
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
station and the s gateway

753
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,279
and the third is s5 barrel between the

754
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,880
sk and the p gateway the eps scale the

755
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,279
one eps pay will be assigned an ip

756
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,840
address and associated with okay the

757
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,600
qos for example like okay the volte

758
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
signaling pair will be assigned

759
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,559
highest serving priority in the serial

760
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,360
networks okay

761
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,279
now you may think okay is it sort of

762
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,279
difficult to understand okay that's fine

763
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,279
let's take a look from

764
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,960
let's take a look at the from the phone

765
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,399
perspective

766
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,440
on our phone okay there is an ims

767
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,519
application they can help us to

768
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,760
establish a volte code with the

769
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,880
operator

770
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,760
and on our smartphone we can have a two

771
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,360
nail interfaces

772
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,799
i made one and i'm not a zero i made one

773
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,200
is reserved for the volte services which

774
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,519
means they can provide image application

775
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,799
to communicate with the ima server

776
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,360
the other name interface is a reservable

777
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
data

778
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,200
for when when the user try to ask

779
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,039
internet all the traffic will be

780
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,880
transmitted over the data interface okay

781
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
then we also find the layers asset

782
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,840
control deployer on the operating system

783
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,559
okay we find okay phone will actually

784
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,320
transmit the packet

785
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,039
destiny to the ims server

786
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,000
using the volte interface which means if

787
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,279
your packet are routed to the image

788
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,159
server you can use the volte interface

789
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,720
otherwise your packet will be routed

790
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,120
through the data network interface

791
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,679
however we discover two vulnerabilities

792
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
on our phone okay

793
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,159
we actually first one is with the root

794
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,360
privilege

795
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
this software-based as a control can be

796
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
easily compromised we just need to

797
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,240
modify the routing table on our

798
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,559
operating system we can mainly add a

799
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,120
host on internet to a routing table so

800
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,679
that we are able to transmit the package

801
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,120
to the host on internet using the volte

802
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,039
signaling interface

803
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
and the second monopoly is that we find

804
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,159
okay our however modern do not deploy

805
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
any additional asset control so which

806
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
means that by leveraging these two more

807
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
abilities and the wrestler you can

808
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
transmit data to any hook through the

809
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,600
voltage signal interface on our phone

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,960
and the next vulnerability we discovered

811
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
from the infrastructure actually several

812
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
from the atm d and the verizon we find

813
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,880
that they do not they have lately okay

814
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
as control is improved

815
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
which means that they allow the

816
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
adversary they can communicate with

817
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
another divide mobile devices over

818
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,960
another host on the internet

819
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
through the volte

820
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,839
signaling barrel okay

821
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,800
and

822
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,119
on atmt they support the mobile to

823
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,679
internet communication and mobile to

824
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
mobile communication on verizon they

825
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,839
support a mobile to mobile communication

826
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,399
okay including a multi to the volte and

827
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,639
the voltage to the data as i mentioned

828
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,918
earlier okay

829
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,440
for volte code for 40 phone they support

830
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,918
let's support two interfaces right one

831
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
is for volte the other is for data

832
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,879
service

833
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
and we find

834
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,520
on force atm t and the verizon if laser

835
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
product mobile to mobile communication

836
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
you can communicate with another mobile

837
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,639
device through his volte interface and

838
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,159
his data interface

839
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,399
based on these dreamweaver abilities

840
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
then we can devise a

841
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
lot of interesting attacks

842
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800
first one is that we can obtain a free

843
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,440
data service from operators

844
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
why the reason is that

845
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,640
in a current practice okay the voices

846
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
will be only charged by the time

847
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,440
duration of what's called rather than

848
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
data violence which means that if the

849
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,520
code is never

850
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,599
been established we don't need to pay

851
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,440
for that okay not just in the united

852
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,520
states in many countries that is a

853
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,160
common practice so which means that we

854
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,400
don't need to pay for the voice

855
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,640
signaling messages okay they'll be free

856
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,520
of charge okay so we find if we are able

857
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,920
to transmit the data through the voltage

858
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,240
signal payroll and all the services will

859
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,920
be free and

860
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
another good thing is yeah not good

861
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
thing for operator but another thing for

862
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,520
adversary is our traffic will be

863
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
assigned highest serving priority in the

864
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,800
cellular networks okay we do not observe

865
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,280
any limitation on the violence

866
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
throughput or duration

867
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,960
for the free data service

868
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
and another attacker variant is okay

869
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
over bidding attack

870
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
yeah we can leverage the mobile to

871
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
mobile communication especially for the

872
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,560
voltage to the data adversary we can

873
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
transmit a lot

874
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
large number of wanted data to the

875
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,520
victim

876
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
then we can bypass operators net and

877
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
firewall protection average for net and

878
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
file protection are used to prevent

879
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,079
unsolicited data spent for internet

880
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,480
right if a if a mobile user didn't send

881
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,359
a packet to internet first they will not

882
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,000
receive any incoming package okay

883
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
however by leveraging this attack we can

884
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,359
bypass this firewall protection it's

885
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,320
because this attack is launched inside

886
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,480
of the serial number rather than outside

887
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,280
of a serial network okay adversary we

888
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
don't need to pay for the low center

889
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,680
data span however

890
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,359
victim you need to pay for that because

891
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,839
you receive those unwanted packets

892
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,880
through your data interface okay so you

893
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
need to pay for those spam

894
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
yeah another attack variance is a data

895
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,839
deny of such attacks okay so idea is

896
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,320
that we can exploit in the mobile to

897
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,119
mobile communication but in this time

898
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,359
this time we leverage a voltage to volte

899
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,440
communication which means that we

900
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
transmit unwanted data to victims

901
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
40

902
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,880
interface okay victor you don't need to

903
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,920
pay for that but you will risk you will

904
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
use all of your resources to receive

905
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,440
unwanted packet because the voltage

906
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,320
signal would be as is assigned high

907
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,040
service priority

908
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,640
if the vidcon device only have a limited

909
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,440
resources and he need to receive a lot

910
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,079
of package he can only spend off his

911
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,960
resource receiving the unwanted voltage

912
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
signal on the message because voltage

913
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
signal magic is assigned hide the

914
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
service priority okay so in this attack

915
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,079
we can find after the adversary start to

916
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,359
send the spare the unwanted voltage

917
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,079
spans to the victim and the mixing data

918
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,800
service is separated is reduced to zero

919
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,520
in a short time

920
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,160
and the next i'd like to introduce okay

921
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,560
this attack can applied to the okay both

922
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,880
of 40 services and for both voting users

923
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,079
and the

924
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,880
voice over wi-fi users we call it a code

925
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
dos attack

926
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,200
so the goal of this attack is prevent

927
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
victims from receiving any incoming

928
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,520
calls how can we make it so basically we

929
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,359
try to live we try to abuse the

930
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,800
reliability of a probationary responses

931
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,760
in the civic flow what are the

932
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,200
professional responses actually in a sip

933
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,920
coverall there are two types of

934
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,880
responses one is a final response

935
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,599
final response is for example

936
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,359
the address

937
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,000
i just send an invite to the bob the

938
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
final response will be 200 okay after

939
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,000
the bob answers the call okay 200 okay

940
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
is a final response to a civil invite

941
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,960
the other type of response is

942
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,640
provisional response they are used to

943
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
provide another community party with

944
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
some updates for example a progress of

945
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,640
receipt called establishment right

946
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,680
and

947
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,040
for some

948
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
important provisional response we need

949
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,359
to guarantee the delivery okay of the

950
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,839
the provisional response success right

951
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,480
so according to standard to deliver

952
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,160
those uh

953
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
to to deliver okay to reliably deliver

954
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,400
the provision response to another site

955
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,720
recipient once recipient receive a

956
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
provisional response important

957
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,280
permission response they need to send a

958
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
provisional acknowledgement the bachelor

959
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,480
center okay if the

960
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
if the center does not receive a

961
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
acknowledgement

962
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,280
the sender will keep resenting the

963
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,560
provisional response until he receives

964
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,760
the acknowledgement or maxima of

965
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
retransmission range

966
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,800
okay

967
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,599
so

968
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,440
according to standard

969
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,119
180 session progress is important okay

970
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,160
professional response which means

971
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,760
unreceived of 183 session progress

972
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,240
sender you need to reply the provision

973
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,119
app to the kodi otherwise caller will

974
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,280
keep resending the the

975
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,119
183 certain progress to the center okay

976
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,599
so then we find

977
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,560
this design will get the kodi get stuck

978
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,319
in a proceeding state

979
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,800
i send i send the session programs to

980
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,240
the coder but i didn't receive

981
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,200
acknowledgement back right and i will

982
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,040
get started in a personal state in this

983
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
proceeding instead i cannot receive any

984
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,759
incoming calls okay

985
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,079
then so that we can developer attack is

986
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,280
that okay

987
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,599
then we can send the same invite to the

988
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,640
victim

989
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,359
and once okay i'm sorry okay

990
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,760
let's go back to brie slide okay

991
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,720
after the maxima number of the

992
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,800
registration reaches

993
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,119
the imx server they will center the

994
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,160
cancel to both caller and the recording

995
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
okay so the code has been

996
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,319
okay canceled okay

997
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,440
so based on this design we can develop a

998
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
tab is that we can send a sim invited to

999
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,599
the victim okay then we then receive the

1000
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,440
code the victim will send the session

1001
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,680
progress back to us then we will not

1002
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,800
send any provisional act to the victor

1003
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,960
so the victim will get stuck in the

1004
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,359
preceding state and the victim cannot

1005
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,839
receive cannot accept any

1006
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,680
incoming code okay

1007
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,960
after we after receiving the cancel from

1008
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,760
the

1009
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
infrastructure then we send another ship

1010
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
invite to the victim

1011
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,920
and the fire launches attack we fight

1012
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
each attack attempter can cause the 40

1013
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,119
second to the 32 second co dos duration

1014
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,960
yeah the tiny variables are different

1015
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,560
operators okay because of the maxima

1016
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,480
the number of amazement retransformation

1017
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,960
will vary with different operators then

1018
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
our research show okay we can prevent a

1019
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,640
victim from receiving a call up to a 97

1020
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,040
percent overall a time okay they will

1021
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,839
not

1022
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,160
receive they are not able to receive any

1023
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,960
incoming calls

1024
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,839
okay our world has been

1025
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,400
mobilized okay to secure a mobilized

1026
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,640
world definitely required a lot of

1027
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,280
interdisciplinary technologies including

1028
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,240
assistance security networking and ai

1029
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,560
so i think if you are interested in this

1030
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
permitting and research area yeah i'm

1031
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,040
very happy to collaborate with you and

1032
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,520
see if we can make the world much better

1033
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,119
okay

1034
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,599
thank you for listening my talk i'm very

1035
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,280
happy to take any questions from you

1036
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
yes oh hi all so you can type your

1037
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,879
question in the q a

1038
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,240
um

1039
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,319
and

1040
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,480
maybe i can uh oh i had little wait for

1041
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,160
out of the question but before that

1042
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,640
listen when we wait i've asked you

1043
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,119
so do you think this question i think i

1044
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,000
kind of

1045
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,240
wonder you know what this problem will

1046
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,720
be disappeared actually one side is

1047
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,598
widely used

1048
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,960
uh

1049
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,119
yeah actually this probably would be

1050
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,440
probably used for example like uh the

1051
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,839
voice dos attack okay they can apply to

1052
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,160
the old ims best the voice because in

1053
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,960
the 5g even the voiceover are not let's

1054
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,079
still leverage existing ims system right

1055
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
so that we can launch this attack yeah

1056
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,119
definitely can be applied to the review

1057
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,520
or not yeah so you mean 5g current

1058
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,119
didn't take any

1059
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,160
lessons

1060
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,520
we already dis you already disclosed

1061
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,560
actually in the 4g network yeah actually

1062
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
we we have a reported our fight into the

1063
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,000
gsms yes i mean also at the middle uh

1064
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,880
there is a design problem yeah but uh

1065
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
seems sort of too late so it's it's not

1066
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,079
applied to the lattice of 5g release yet

1067
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,680
yeah

1068
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,800
i say

1069
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,119
so likely means the current ascendant

1070
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,240
maker

1071
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,560
uh is aware of the problem but

1072
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,280
unfortunately the recent effort haven't

1073
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,240
uh

1074
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
or at least a low fat we do not know if

1075
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
they have any plan to address this issue

1076
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
because so far in the current 5d

1077
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,839
standard we can still see the voice

1078
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,200
calling ig i still suffer from this kind

1079
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,040
of attack exposed by you right yes yes

1080
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,839
yeah because the the the 5g voice

1081
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,680
service and the 4g services let's still

1082
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,319
build on top or image okay if we are

1083
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,240
still using the same image design and

1084
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,000
the same problem will be

1085
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,240
what will be assembled in the 5g i do

1086
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,839
believe so yeah

1087
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,240
so do you think we actually should

1088
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,440
uh give up this kind of the voice cause

1089
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,200
provided by operator

1090
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,960
should we just go to writing because so

1091
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
far there are so many actual ways of

1092
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,079
supported by data service rather more

1093
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,839
broadband services

1094
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,359
yes yes uh

1095
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,880
no since that okay as

1096
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,040
one introduced uh in in

1097
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,000
there is okay uh deep in grand design

1098
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,839
principle voice first

1099
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,720
operator uh we only provide a layer

1100
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,119
voice service with a higher service

1101
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,520
priority yeah so that they can

1102
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,920
help us to obtain a better voice quality

1103
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,680
so if operator

1104
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,280
sold only

1105
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,160
are really into okay the provided also

1106
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,800
broadband voiceover such as skype or

1107
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,920
whatsapp with a higher priority i i do

1108
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,599
believe that they can have a similar

1109
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,359
performance not like the volte or vrn

1110
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,400
services yeah

1111
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,920
then how it will

1112
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,400
impact like another smartphone right we

1113
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,520
go to from smartphone to iot device

1114
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,200
and

1115
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,079
it doesn't make any change

1116
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,040
right

1117
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,920
uh

1118
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,319
for iot uh let me see

1119
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,640
basically the iot

1120
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,880
actually uh

1121
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,480
in a project currently there are only

1122
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,680
the two uh cellular device uh the style

1123
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,280
iot uh

1124
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,760
say okay deployed broadly deported

1125
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
cellular iot technology one is the ltm

1126
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
bi is the narrowband iot

1127
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,200
ltm support both data voids and the test

1128
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,280
service and the data the most service

1129
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,200
are supported by ims

1130
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,520
and for their iot they only support data

1131
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,720
steps only

1132
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,319
so which means that the same problem

1133
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,960
will be applied to the ltem cellular iot

1134
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,960
technology rather than mbiot yeah but in

1135
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,280
in in the 5g okay actually the 5g uh iot

1136
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,599
standards may not uh

1137
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,839
fully finalize yet people still

1138
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,400
discovering some features on the 5g of

1139
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
the iot devices but we still can see the

1140
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,720
voiceovers and the test series will be

1141
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,480
supported by the part of our partial iot

1142
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,640
technology but not all for iot

1143
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,800
technologies 5g iot technologies

1144
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,720
and scott i think we have two more

1145
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,960
questions so one is from the q and a can

1146
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,200
you say that or you mean

1147
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,439
you

1148
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,800
so i can actually ask one question

1149
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,119
about a literature communication service

1150
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,119
can you say that yeah i can see that

1151
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,800
okay okay so

1152
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,640
so basically the rich communication

1153
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,240
service um

1154
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,480
actually uh in addition to the

1155
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,359
we can say okay we can say uh the i'm

1156
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,680
expect so much is not considered a

1157
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,040
conditional uh traditional test services

1158
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
because

1159
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,599
it's uh uh transmitted over the sip okay

1160
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,440
basically we can carry lots of

1161
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,400
multimedia okay like video picture we

1162
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,480
can carry a lot of okay the multimedia

1163
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,559
we uh fires there

1164
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,040
okay so that uh

1165
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,559
so which means that

1166
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,400
uh

1167
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,720
okay we can tell you okay

1168
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,319
according to our experience that we

1169
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,440
didn't see the lots of operational okay

1170
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,680
the rich communication service otherwise

1171
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,880
we already

1172
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,599
we already studied the security of that

1173
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,520
so let's see that okay

1174
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,079
yeah operator try to promote the layer

1175
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,960
rich communication service but since uh

1176
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,319
it's not

1177
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,839
very okay promising at least to the

1178
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,960
end users so that you can see nothing

1179
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,599
right now maybe you didn't say actually

1180
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,800
you know we used to reach a

1181
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,000
communication service to replace the sms

1182
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,920
but i think that the student is asking

1183
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
what do you think about the future

1184
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
what's the reason about that for example

1185
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
five years later or in the in the in the

1186
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,079
near future right for some future do you

1187
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,079
think it will be the trend

1188
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,040
actually

1189
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,359
wait the the traditional show message

1190
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,880
maybe traditional voice call will

1191
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,119
disappear but the new service like the

1192
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,480
regional communication service will

1193
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,760
replace that

1194
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,000
i think this is the first year i i know

1195
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,680
what you mean

1196
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,040
but my opinion is okay actually

1197
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,839
yeah

1198
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,640
we can say in the last okay 10 years

1199
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,960
i've already looked at the 3gb try to

1200
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,400
promote a lot of

1201
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,160
the multimedia services for example like

1202
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,640
push to talk okay but we didn't see any

1203
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,200
particular services deployed in practice

1204
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,920
yeah

1205
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,680
they can they can deploy that and then

1206
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,520
we will see okay basically let's see

1207
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,359
that okay if

1208
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,558
uh if we start

1209
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,240
this is actually in the there's a lot of

1210
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,800
the stator hulk uh

1211
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,880
stakeholder and then actually there's

1212
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
kind of a computer i think you know the

1213
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,599
different like some vendor operator may

1214
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,760
have different opinion from a bigger

1215
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,760
company like google and facebook of meta

1216
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,680
or other company right the internet

1217
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,520
service provider may have the different

1218
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,280
view of long is telecom vendors correct

1219
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,559
yes yes

1220
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,800
yeah and then that he had also had

1221
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,319
another question is what do you think

1222
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,160
about the vendor corporation is

1223
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,559
reshaping up shaping up the mobile

1224
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,800
security landscape

1225
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,720
yeah he has two questions

1226
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,960
this question let me see

1227
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,680
uh could you say because i currently say

1228
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,200
you know akash has questioned and on a

1229
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
similar note how

1230
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,800
what do you think about the vendor

1231
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,280
corporation is shaping up the mobile

1232
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,480
security landscape

1233
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,000
[Music]

1234
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,079
answer the question corporations are

1235
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,359
stripping up okay yeah

1236
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,880
i think so but

1237
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
in property let me see

1238
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,680
yes uh

1239
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,760
actually it depends on the

1240
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,880
the depends on vendors because we we

1241
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,599
actually will report a lot of

1242
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,520
issues to the different operators they

1243
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,839
have different responses okay some

1244
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,000
operator and the device vendor they are

1245
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,079
more willing to address the problems we

1246
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,240
report about some some just say okay

1247
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,319
let's not layer progress

1248
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,559
the end user you have be responsible for

1249
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,800
those problems yeah we didn't see a

1250
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,920
different attitudes yeah

1251
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,040
thank you

1252
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,960
and uh and

1253
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,400
there's one more question can you say

1254
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,319
that okay yeah i can see it okay

1255
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,839
yeah so basically we we discover lots of

1256
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,400
our abilities from uh

1257
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,800
first of all we discovered a problem

1258
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,440
from the real okay service operational

1259
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
services because we try to identify the

1260
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,240
real okay threats so we have paid more

1261
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,960
attention to those operational services

1262
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,680
however we still read a lot of cgb

1263
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,359
standards then we can know why this

1264
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,680
we can identify root cause real root

1265
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,640
cause of discovery vulnerabilities then

1266
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,559
then we can further provide a solution

1267
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,200
to address the standard progress so that

1268
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,760
we can benefit all the mobile users and

1269
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
operators yeah basically that's our

1270
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,319
research philosophy

1271
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,839
uh i i think it's

1272
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,240
also kind of full it's not a high-level

1273
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,920
idea it's more like a more concrete

1274
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,240
problem is how reading starts for

1275
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,520
example by by reading tongues of the 3gb

1276
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,400
spec

1277
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,920
to figure out action there was a

1278
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,160
possible vulnerability or you actually

1279
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,119
already come up with a tag and then look

1280
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,319
at the spec try to answer that which one

1281
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,240
start first maybe

1282
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,880
so what is the source of these attack

1283
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,400
ideas

1284
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,240
yeah you can just discover the

1285
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,880
operational search first then you go to

1286
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,280
study his standards you can start your

1287
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,240
gsms standard first because gsma will

1288
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,880
stipulate all the regulation for

1289
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
operational services then you can see

1290
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,359
then after you read a standard you can

1291
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,800
know what

1292
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,599
what are the potential progress you can

1293
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,599
you probably can find for an operational

1294
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,920
service then you cannot experiment

1295
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,079
so basically we conduct a guide for

1296
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,880
standard guide experiments so we just we

1297
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,359
will not just simply okay around the

1298
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,240
the 1000 okay experiments yeah we will

1299
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
read the standard first then we know

1300
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,119
where the possible issues then where are

1301
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,480
the possible issues then we'll come down

1302
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,839
the validation experiments

1303
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,400
yeah and an inquisition no more

1304
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,680
um i

1305
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,119
if there's any other question

1306
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,119
okay if no more question i think that

1307
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,280
coming current is perfect

1308
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,359
and uh thank you for everybody for

1309
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,280
coming to today's action the seminar

1310
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,359
talk and excuse scott thank you very

1311
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,200
