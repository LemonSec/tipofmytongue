1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,160
uh our next presenter uh is uh professor

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,200
young kim

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,480
uh young is the associate head

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
for research uh in the biomedical

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
engineering department here at purdue

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
young welcome

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
good afternoon um thank you so much for

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
the kind invitation i'm going to talk

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
about a little bit um different topic um

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,519
maybe um

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,840
it's kind of new to you but um i think

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
you can guess from this title so the the

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,880
title of talk here is counterfeit

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,520
medicines are fundamental security

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,079
problem you'll see a lot of kind of

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
common issues for many other uh security

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
issues um so my name is young kim from

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
biomedical engineering

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
so just to give you a uh kind of uh

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
perspective about this talk i just have

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
one slide what i'm doing in the lab

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
actually we're doing some live matter

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,879
interactions in particular biological

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,680
tissue so we are using some of natural

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
materials such as silk and also another

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,520
um

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
project we are doing actively here in

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
the lab um is some m house mobile health

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
and telemedicine and here the

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
anti-counterfeit technologies and

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
actually i'm trying to combine these so

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,759
that a hybridization of a digital

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
properties and material properties and

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
also i'm doing some

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,040
i must see i'm not a cs guy and an

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
engineer and we know how to do some

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
modeling and we know the kind of physics

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,720
behind so idea is that let's incorporate

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
some of our knowledge

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
into deep learning so that

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
we can avoid the sum of limitations that

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,119
just the purely data-driven approaches

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
so that's what i'm doing so we'll see

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
some combinations

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,399
so let's talk about the main topic as

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
you know the problem of counterfeit

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
medicine is not new

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
uh it's becoming a tremendous burden in

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
our society

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,280
as you know the medicines and

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
pharmaceutical products are most

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
vulnerable goods

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
for example it's related to patient

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
safety

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
public uh health

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
economy laws and also elect intellectual

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
uh property infringement so

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,239
covers

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,840
many different issues in our society

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
so let's have some definitions actually

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
um there are many different categories

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
so um it's confusing

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
the first one is a substandard as you

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
can guess is uh does not meet the

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,360
quality of measurement

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
and the false fight

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
sometimes it looks real but actually

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
contains some

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
toxic uh materials inside

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
and then the drug diversion is another

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,360
big issue

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
it's legal but kind of used in an

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
illegal manner it's a big issue

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
sometimes

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
and who defined the counter on

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
counterfeit medicine in this way

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,360
with respect to identity and or source

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
it's this kind of broad definition so in

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
this talk i'm going to use this broad

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
definition of

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
counterfeit medicine so kind of

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
following the who's definition

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
so let me show you some problems kind of

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
this is a snapshot um

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
you'll be surprised to see this actually

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
counterfeit

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
medicine for malaria and pneumonia uh

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
treatment in particular in africa

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,799
actually cost

91
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,360
250 000 children death each year it's

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
quite um surprising um

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
effect

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
uh this is one statistic from hong kong

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,080
actually 40 of viagra sales

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
uh counterfeit

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
and some incident in singapore

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
and actually in the u.s we have this

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
opioid crisis

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
and it's kind of partially due to

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,798
the

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,040
counterfeit medicine actually you can

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
find a counterfeit opioid easily from

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
the um from online

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,599
so these are some of the examples

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,159
and another big example is the issue is

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
the online or internet pharmacist so let

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
me ask you a question

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
so let's say if you just have an access

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
to internet if you search um

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
just to buy something from online

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
pharmacies

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
do you know how many online pharmacies

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
out there

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
in the world just guess

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
thousands right definitely

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,840
the answer is if you just have access

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
now i think roughly you can have you can

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
find 40 000 online pharmacies worldwide

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
and some statistics say actually every

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
month we have a new 600 new pharmacies

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
that they're in and out all the time as

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
you can see

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
next question

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
then how many of them are operating

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
legally just guess like percentage

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
yes maybe like one percent one person i

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,440
think you're generous actually um um

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
you're not you're not generous so i'm

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,240
sorry so the statistics that is only

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,639
from three to four percent actually

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
operating legally as you can see the

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
issue

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
uh this is some statistics actually uh

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
twelve percent uh more than uh the

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
illegal online pharmacist actually they

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
sell controlled substances

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
without any uh prescription in the us

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
and actually that really contributed the

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
opioid endemic even among our high

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
school and um you know college students

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
uh here in the u.s

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
and as you can see this ongoing pandemic

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
of kobe 19 has boosted the use of

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
all kind of online shoppings including

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
online pharmacies so um as you can see

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,199
we will expect to see a lot more of

148
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,199
this

149
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,720
anti-counterfeit medicines

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
from online or internet pharmacies

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
and let's talk about a little bit about

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
regulatory landscape um definitely fda

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,120
is doing something so this is the uh

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
fda's drug supply chain security act um

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
basically uh the

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
manufacturers pharmaceutical

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,479
manufacturers wholesalers and pharmacies

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
clinics they need to actually have

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,759
some level of unit level tracing by 2023

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
basically next year

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
so was enacted 2013 as you can see it

162
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
took basically 10 years to get to this

163
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,880
point

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
and um i got to learn very

165
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
intriguing lesson actually from

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
pharmaceutical companies do you know

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,639
their strategy to meet this requirement

168
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
they have a really simple solution just

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
pay fines that's it and that's their

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
approach because

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,319
it's not not a big deal for them um

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
given that their you know revenue is big

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
and etc so i heard that they're the

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,360
biggest

175
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
is yeah let's stay buying the fan uh the

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
pay the fines so um

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400
but the good thing is they're doing

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
something uh to meet this requirement

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
now you may heard about this uh it's

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
called the med ledger um so major

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
pharmaceutical companies um and uh

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,039
distributors uh including amazon and i

183
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
think the walmart as well

184
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,599
so they created this um

185
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,639
a blockchain based solution just to have

186
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,000
some uh

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
meet the requirement by fda for uh the

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
pharmaceutical supply chain um

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
so i don't know some people like

190
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
blockchain and some people really hate

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
them so i don't know it's good or bad

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
but i think they're getting some

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
attention in this domain

194
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
so some of the current technologies out

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
there is based on package level

196
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,919
technologies as you can see we have some

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
a bar chord and a qr code and sometimes

198
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
we use the

199
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
radio frequency id

200
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
rfid so it's more like a package level

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,000
in a box level right

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
and we do have some uh advanced

203
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
technologies out there um they're using

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
some different uh polymers and dna and

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
some gold uh the metal materials

206
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
and etc i think the thing is you'll see

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,560
a lot of publications uh papers in china

208
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,520
um

209
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,319
in some east asia but we don't see much

210
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
of the activity in the u.s

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
and also i did a bit uh did a little bit

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,919
of a kind of search homework can see um

213
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
so we really want to do on those

214
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
authentication that means i'll have

215
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
another slide about ondo's

216
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
authentication is that you really want

217
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
to have a security measures on the pill

218
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
not on the box

219
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
so that we have a more protection

220
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
actually the security level is higher so

221
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,640
these are some of the technologies and

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
companies for ando's

223
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
technologies but as you'll see that

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
sometimes

225
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,959
requires a very uh specialized readers

226
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,680
um so we cannot just the patients or the

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
end users customers have

228
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,839
don't don't have the access to do it

229
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,720
and

230
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
it's very actually it's a really good

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
market um it's based on these uh the

232
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,640
market research actually it's um you

233
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
know even they're talking about one

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
billion dollar kind of market um

235
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
because we'll see more of um

236
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
counterfeit medicines actually i have a

237
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,240
dog and my wife orders some heart from

238
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
medicine through the internet because a

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
lot cheaper

240
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
but i have no idea whether this is

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
really you know genuine and trustworthy

242
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
or just you know they have the same

243
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
package so that we have no idea

244
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
so let's talk about some on those and in

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
those applications basically again we

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
want to do achieve a dose level

247
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,120
authentication not from the package

248
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
level authentication

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
so the problem is often time the

250
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
medicines are separated from the

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
original package and then a place into

252
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,120
individual dose actually this is a

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
common practice in hospital pharmacies

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
they receive bulk and they don't keep

255
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
them as a bulk and then they just put a

256
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
tiny tiny boxes and they put individual

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
pills

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
and depends on the

259
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
those unit actually they have another

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
packaging etc

261
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
that's for um they really want to

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,959
minimize this uh

263
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
dispensing errors and also the

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
management and etc

265
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
and as you know secondary packaging just

266
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,000
the box is highly vulnerable it's very

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
easy to copy if you have a good scanner

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
and some technologies

269
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
it's quite straightforward to copy exact

270
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,839
box

271
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
and also some of technologies um some

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
analytical chemistry based one in

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
particular requires trained uh personnel

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,279
and also we need to have very

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,079
sophisticated analyzers and readers and

276
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,920
etc so the bottom line is that the um

277
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
those things are not really designed for

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
patients such as me so i don't have any

279
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
access to those and

280
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
i think in order to really um fight

281
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
against uh counterfeit medicine patients

282
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
uh uh has to have to play a role so

283
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
that's the kind of whole motivation for

284
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
research

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
and in that case uh we need to identify

286
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
safe edible materials um so that we can

287
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
encode some information in there

288
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
and some of um to commonly use the

289
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
materials not ideal for oral intake

290
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
because

291
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
usually use the synthetic materials and

292
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
artificial addictions

293
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
and we saw that actually they can have

294
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
some

295
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
some diversity effect and one of the

296
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
example is actually this one is

297
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
dalate uh it's a really common uh

298
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
kind of material coding material for

299
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
pharmacists but actually there's some

300
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
studies showing that they really change

301
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
our hormone production so uh there are

302
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
some issues about

303
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,399
endocrine

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
disruption using this so there's uh

305
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
should be some caution if you use some

306
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,200
of the synthetic artificial adjectives

307
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
so in terms of material so this is what

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
we are identified actually we use silk

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,399
proteins and fluorescence proteins we

310
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
are just using all proteins we don't use

311
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
any artificial

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
materials

313
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
and silk as you know it's from silk

314
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
cocoons um it's a typical material for

315
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
textile but actually it's edible it's

316
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,200
all protein and even fda

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
allow us to eat silk proteins it's just

318
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
protein if you know if after you get

319
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,720
some exercise if you need some protein

320
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,360
intake actually you can eat silk

321
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
and also we use fluorescence proteins

322
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
these fluorescent proteins that generate

323
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
some fluorescence signals again it's all

324
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
proteins we don't use any artificial

325
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
or synthetic materials and the nice

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
thing about this is that um

327
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
we can um

328
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
dissolve into some solutions as you can

329
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
see and then we can make rigid or

330
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,399
flexible we can make many different

331
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,839
types of structures it's basically

332
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,240
biopolymer and we can tune mechanical or

333
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
optical properties in etc so

334
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,680
we decided to use silk and silk proteins

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,560
and fluorescence proteins for to encode

336
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,519
some of the information

337
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
so this is overall approach definitely

338
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
we need to develop some kind of um the

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
tagging or text that can be attached to

340
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
our individual medicine and then our

341
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
idea is that we want to generate some

342
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
keys or them encode some information

343
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,639
and then we have to have some database

344
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
to store or if you have an algorithm i

345
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
know sometimes we don't want to have a

346
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
centralized data base and then another

347
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
idea is then if you can have some

348
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,040
algorithm then we can encode some

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,240
information

350
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
and then patient actually ideally if

351
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
they can use their smartphone and then

352
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
authenticate so then they don't need to

353
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
remove the tag from the the pill because

354
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
again it's all

355
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
edible and so they can just take it so

356
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,480
that's the idea then i think we have a

357
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
tool

358
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,639
we can empower actually patients to play

359
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
a role in this case

360
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
so i'm going to share

361
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
some of studies and technologies in the

362
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
lab we have a few others in the lab

363
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,560
but i just decided to uh share like

364
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
three different technologies the first

365
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,760
one is

366
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
edible

367
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
physical unclonable functions i think if

368
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,560
you're in cs i think you heard about

369
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
physically on cloneable functions like

370
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
puff right and we sort of mimic the idea

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
of puff to make this

372
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,959
and another one is edible cyber physical

373
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
watermarking combination of just the

374
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
physical water marking and digital water

375
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
watermarking together

376
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,279
and then another one is this the simple

377
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,720
idea we can make some edible qr code

378
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,000
it's very similar to just the

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,279
conventional qr code but based on all

380
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,760
edible materials so you can eat it so

381
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
i'll just share each technologies

382
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
so the first one uh some background i

383
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
think you guys know this better than me

384
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
uh physically uh on cloneable functions

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,399
puff so this is the really rough idea

386
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
from engineering perspective

387
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
developed originally in a computer

388
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,440
science it's more like algorithm and

389
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
sometimes it's called one-way function

390
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,079
so this is more like a digital

391
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,639
fingerprint and the nice thing is we

392
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
have a really uh good large number of

393
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
pairs of

394
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,079
challenges

395
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,120
inputs

396
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
and then response outputs

397
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
so you want to actually have many pairs

398
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,120
of challenges and responses

399
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
so that we can have a large a parameter

400
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,279
space so you

401
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
still want to use one time you want to

402
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
do multiple times so that you can have a

403
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,399
really uh the high security or guarantee

404
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,199
that the authentication is um

405
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,600
guaranteed so that's the idea of puff so

406
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the key thing is here

407
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
uh a large prime parameter space and we

408
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,839
usually have

409
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,880
input

410
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
and output pairs or the challenge in

411
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,320
response pairs

412
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
and another seminar of work um kind of

413
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
we are inspired by this work is called

414
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
the physical one-way function this old

415
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,040
paper published in science 2002

416
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
of folks in mit media group actually uh

417
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
they come up with the uh came up with

418
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,519
the idea about optical puff using um

419
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,440
random media scattering media so if you

420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
shine light and you'll see speckle

421
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,160
pattern

422
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
and this speckle pattern is very unique

423
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
it's really hard to replicate and then

424
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,959
from this they can get a key so it shows

425
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
some enrollment and verification so the

426
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
idea is let's use this more like a

427
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
physical

428
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
tag as

429
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
a puff actually they did not use the

430
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,880
term a puff

431
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,959
so they used the one-way function but

432
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,839
the later people realized that actually

433
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
this idea is more aligned the puff in cs

434
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
so nowadays people use the optical puff

435
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
as a terminology to describe this more

436
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
like a hardware security um

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
measures

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,799
so the first one this is the idea so um

439
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,480
in order to have

440
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,439
challenge and response pairs

441
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
we use let's go back to here um

442
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
fluorescence silk micro particles so we

443
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
have four different um

444
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,880
fluorescence silica micro particles so

445
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,120
each side is as you can see hundred

446
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
microns it's quite big in some sense

447
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
and then this mixture of four different

448
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,799
uh

449
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,080
fluorescence

450
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
micro particles

451
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
we just

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
broadcast

453
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
then as you can guess you're not gonna

454
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
get the same pattern

455
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
at all because each one is very unique

456
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
so that's what that's the idea of for a

457
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
puff so in this case

458
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
because we used four different

459
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
fluorescence uh micro particles so the

460
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
challenge is as you know fluorescence

461
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,440
you require the excitation you need the

462
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,880
emission um

463
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
and we can have different pairs of sets

464
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
of excitation in emission that serves as

465
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
more like a challenge

466
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
and then based on this we can look at

467
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,080
different particles

468
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
so that we can have a response so uh

469
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
so this is the idea um you can above

470
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
here four different challenges

471
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
and then each challenge we have

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,919
different response and then from this

473
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,480
image we can extract um

474
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
key

475
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
and as you can see the uh the density of

476
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,080
the uh the micro particles is not high

477
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
so we have a lot of empty spaces so if

478
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
you just convert this to

479
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,039
zero and one we have a lot of zeros um

480
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
so we need to do some um

481
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,240
biasing so we ended up doing um von

482
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
neumann d biasing so that the zero and

483
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,000
ones are kind of balanced so and then we

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
got key and then this one shows

485
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,520
basically uh we generated here up to 30

486
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,840
different um

487
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
tags and then we just put them together

488
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,240
on along this vertical line and um

489
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
because we wanted to make sure

490
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
the patterns are random so um we decided

491
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
to use the anista random randomness test

492
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
so that's the kind of data we used

493
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
so we um

494
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
quantify the sum of uh performance

495
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,640
actually you need to have um uniformity

496
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
uh between zero and one the ideally you

497
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
won't have a 50 50 percent right and

498
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,679
then the reproducibility

499
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,000
and then the uniqueness actually each

500
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
one has to be unique and the

501
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,000
reproducibility is that you have a one

502
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
tag if you read multiple times then you

503
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
have to get exactly the same

504
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,440
key so we quantify this and also um we

505
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
wanted to make sure that the pattern is

506
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
random so um decided to use the nist

507
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
randomness test

508
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
so as you know there are about 15

509
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
different

510
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,360
statistical tests uh in the nist test

511
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,559
but in um that's designed for for random

512
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,080
number generators in that case you can

513
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
generate those uh

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
huge

515
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
bit streams of random numbers then you

516
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
can use the all the statistical tests

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
but in our case

518
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
it's limited by number of tags we can

519
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
generate in the produce in the lab so we

520
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,799
ended up using actually um needs to test

521
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,080
to require

522
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,679
a bit stream of 10 to the 8 bits are

523
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,760
quite large to us so we ended up using

524
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
only seven uh

525
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
subtests uh in the nist test but the

526
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
bottom line is that we confirmed that um

527
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,320
the pattern is random so each tag is

528
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
random that means it's quite unique so

529
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
we use the um nist test

530
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,000
for this so this is the idea about

531
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
edible puffs again we borrowed the

532
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,520
concept from computer science puff and

533
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
and another thing is a cyber physical

534
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
water marking um as you know the in the

535
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,679
water marking physical model marketing

536
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,760
if you look at your um

537
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
currency we have a watermark it's more

538
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
like a physical printout and also

539
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
uh in another case is that for digital

540
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,320
content you know audio images video we

541
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,760
have digital water marking so the idea

542
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,039
is that can we combine this physical

543
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,360
water marking and digital water marking

544
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,480
together

545
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
so here this is i know it's a little bit

546
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
busy slide so the first one is the

547
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,679
regenerate a watermark image

548
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
uh in a computer basically a combination

549
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
of host image host image is p

550
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
and then we wanted to um use a number

551
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
eight as

552
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
a watermark so we combined this you know

553
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
digital format and we used the inkjet

554
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
printer um

555
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,840
it's commonly available uh printing

556
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,280
technology and then the nice thing is

557
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
that as an ink we decided to use

558
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
food coloring as an ink so it's all

559
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,600
edible we use the fda approved food

560
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
colorings you can buy you know payless

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
etc

562
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
and then another thing is the uh we use

563
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,000
the uh this uh fluorescence uh fluorine

564
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,720
fluorescence uh paper uh

565
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
uh instead of using paper we use the

566
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,919
fluorescence print sheet the idea is

567
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,919
that if you print this out on the paper

568
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,640
and if you have a nice scanner then you

569
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
can just copy very easy

570
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
uh to have an attack so in order to

571
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
overcome this potential attack so we

572
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,919
actually use the fluorescence printing

573
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,919
materials again it's all

574
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,960
protein it's all edible so if you use

575
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,679
the um scanner and the scan this then

576
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,000
this is fluorescence this generate light

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
a very um

578
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,240
confusing light as a background so it's

579
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
not straightforward to copy the exact

580
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
water marked image

581
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,679
and then this can be attached to an

582
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,039
individual pill

583
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
and then again using smartphone we want

584
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,679
to kind of authenticate or extract the

585
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,039
embedded

586
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,760
watermark so that we can use as

587
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
authentication but applications are like

588
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,919
you know we can have a serialization or

589
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
track and tracing and as well as the

590
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,960
authentication but again we want to do

591
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,400
at the dose level authentication

592
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
the one of the challenges that we had is

593
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
this

594
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,559
and if you have some understanding about

595
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
this whole printing process and also

596
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,880
let's say you take the photo of a

597
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
printed material

598
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,799
we have huge

599
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
color distortion

600
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
so if you have input from your

601
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
computer and then send this to printer

602
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
and then you print out and then if you

603
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,760
look at the color

604
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,679
colors of your printout actually it's

605
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,640
very different from your input because

606
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
distortion happens and then the words

607
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,360
the case if you take the photo using

608
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
your smartphone

609
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,760
your color is different and depends on

610
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
the lighting conditions then depending

611
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
on the kind of model of smartphone

612
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
you're using

613
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,159
we will have all different colors and

614
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,039
now

615
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,960
that was the uh the big challenge so in

616
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
order to overcome this we decided to

617
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
actually use some reference colors

618
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
around the watermark so we really know

619
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,279
the true input of this

620
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
and then we want to use this as a

621
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,120
reference so that we can correct

622
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
the watermarked image based on this so

623
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
this one shows some of the schemes that

624
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
we can really recover through color

625
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
under different um uh the light

626
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
conditions different devices

627
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
etc so um here we put different uh

628
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
watermark images uh so ps our host team

629
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,240
is and the numbers are kind of a

630
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
watermark image we want to embed

631
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
and so this is acquired image and we use

632
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
the different smartphones actually you

633
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
can test this if it's different

634
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,400
smartphones because they have different

635
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
rgb sensitivities and et cetera and also

636
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,039
different lighting conditions you'll

637
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,760
have all different photos and here

638
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
using the uh the 32 reference colors um

639
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
the periphery we can correct the color

640
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
of the watermark at the center so that

641
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
we can extract

642
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,600
watermark reliably so this is the one

643
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,080
demonstration that we can use variety of

644
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
smartphones and then reliably extract

645
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
watermark

646
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,440
and another thing is uh we tested uh

647
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,080
readout reproducibility so let's say you

648
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,960
have a one tag and we use the different

649
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
smartphones and make sure that when we

650
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,000
repeat here you know 100 times that we

651
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
can get exactly the same

652
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
watermark image we embedded so we tested

653
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
this

654
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,480
reproducibility and then let's say we

655
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,600
wanted to make sure about our printing

656
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,919
reproducibility so let's say we want to

657
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,640
print out the same tag again and again

658
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,919
so uh here we printed about 50 or 100 on

659
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,200
a

660
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
here and then we

661
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
tested it actually um statistically

662
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,320
they're identical so i think it's due to

663
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,400
the um just the known technology of

664
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
increased printer

665
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,840
so we can achieve this so this is the

666
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
idea of

667
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
cyber physical water marking and as you

668
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,559
can see

669
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
each technology has

670
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
uh different levels of security and

671
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,000
different potential different

672
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,240
applications

673
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,200
so i'm going to share a video clip under

674
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
a simulated setting it's not a real

675
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,240
setting uh

676
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
so this stuff actually these are the uh

677
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,679
the websites you can report i've somehow

678
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,760
encountered

679
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,679
anti-counterfeit medicine actually one

680
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,039
is from

681
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,799
fda and another one is uh

682
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
another kind of association that really

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,439
uh facilitate the reporting this

684
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,639
let me play this again

685
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,559
so this is again a simulated setting

686
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,640
so the last technology i just want to

687
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
share is basically similar to qr code we

688
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
can make a qr code here the nice thing

689
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,880
is invisible it's all edible invisible

690
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,279
in order to increase the the parameter

691
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,600
space actually we use that

692
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
similar to some of previous studies with

693
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,799
three different uh fluorescence proteins

694
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,039
uh so that we can actually have here

695
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
three different colors

696
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,559
and

697
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,799
so we used very rough uh kind of

698
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,760
patterning to get this um

699
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,279
qr or just

700
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
matrix code

701
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
so we developed a simple uh you know

702
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,120
deem learning algorithm so that

703
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,799
we can reliably extract the key so um

704
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,799
the whole idea we can still use some of

705
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
a conventional etch detection and

706
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,559
imaging processing but

707
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,200
our manufacturing process in the lab is

708
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
not really high-end so if you later show

709
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
that uh see that some secure patterns is

710
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,919
not really perfect so in order to

711
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,720
overcome those uh we just use the um the

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
deep learning um just to have a reliable

713
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,000
extraction of the key and then we have a

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,760
key and then we decided to use some of

715
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
hashi functions so now we have a hash

716
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,919
key through this so this is the

717
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,440
structure so it's

718
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,720
a

719
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,919
thin layer of thin film and then we have

720
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,919
here three different

721
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,559
fluorescence uh proteins and also we

722
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,600
have a white so we have each location we

723
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
have four different

724
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
colors so that we can have some decent

725
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,159
encoding capacity

726
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,080
and then that can be attached to um the

727
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,520
individual pill

728
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
so the reviewer asks what do you use to

729
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,720
glue this and actually the

730
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,840
we use the sugar um glucose

731
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,679
based glue

732
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,240
it's very um reliable

733
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,880
so this is the idea so basically um

734
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
we can shine different light sources so

735
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,080
that we can have different patterns

736
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,279
and

737
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
the nice thing is everything is

738
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
invisible on from the naked eye and then

739
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
we extract the k and then goes to this

740
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,600
hash function and we can use the hash

741
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,640
key

742
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,240
and so we use this for the um the solid

743
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,360
dose

744
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,200
medicine such as you know

745
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
tablet and pill and also we wanted to do

746
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
if we can use actually um the liquid

747
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
medicine

748
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
and the nice thing about so let's first

749
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
demonstrate this

750
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,520
so this tag is attached to a solid

751
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,480
tablet white

752
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
tablet

753
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
so we're shining we are using our

754
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,440
embedded led as a light source

755
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,360
so this is the um the case again on the

756
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,760
simulated setting and we really really

757
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,519
wanted to make sure that we have really

758
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,559
good digestibility um and also the bio

759
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,559
compatibilities and we're going to have

760
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,080
all the consumption

761
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
so we used two different um

762
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,279
kind of enzymes that are

763
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,760
produced in data produced in our body so

764
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,480
uh trypsin is from a small intestines

765
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,279
and then pepsin in our stomach so we use

766
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,279
some enzyme solutions to kind of

767
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
demonstrate actually

768
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,919
degradation happens uh in one hour so

769
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,279
that means actually have a really good

770
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,440
support

771
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
digestibility

772
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,880
and also we really do some uh

773
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,320
biocompatibility um it's called the hemo

774
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,640
hemolysis actually using some of blood

775
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,880
cells and see if there's any toxic

776
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,360
effect when they're exposed to

777
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,519
uh the proteins we're using and actually

778
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,919
there's no um toxicity associated it's

779
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
kind of straightforward so again we're

780
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,720
talking about proteins all the time

781
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
and then actually the next one is again

782
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,200
we wanted to do a liquid medicine and

783
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
then we realized some of liquid medicine

784
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,159
has very high alcohol content

785
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,760
surprisingly

786
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,679
so we decided to use

787
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,840
whiskey because they have even higher

788
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
alcohol content

789
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
and our budget

790
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
was limited so you can see we cannot

791
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
really afford

792
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
high-end whiskies

793
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,360
so we used five different whiskeys and

794
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,240
uh the alcohol content is really high so

795
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
the nice thing about the sum of proteins

796
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,559
we are using is that due to this uh

797
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,960
crystallization

798
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,080
the the shape is maintained in high

799
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,519
alcohol

800
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,159
solution so as you can see here we put

801
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,799
this tag over a six month

802
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,039
in these bottles

803
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,799
doesn't change that much so that means

804
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,399
actually we can put

805
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,679
edible tag into the bottle

806
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880
and then we can use this as a security

807
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,720
tag um

808
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
so this is the through the bottle again

809
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,600
now we have to image this so this is the

810
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
example

811
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
we use the

812
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,080
johnny walker a johnny walker

813
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,159
and again the tag is inside in the

814
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,480
bottle

815
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,000
so we are

816
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
looking imaging the tag through the

817
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,679
bottle

818
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,279
and actually we uh published this

819
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,840
article and then the um the journal said

820
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,159
you need to get a um

821
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,519
permission from

822
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,080
one of the vendors so we just decided to

823
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,480
blur out the all the um the brand names

824
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
and etc

825
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,119
so let me kind of finish up the

826
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,119
the talk so

827
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:15,918
we

828
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,918
developed the different types of the

829
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,480
technology secure security technologies

830
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,879
for pharmaceutical products and medicine

831
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,359
so the one is optical puff and then the

832
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,599
second one is kind of we revisited the

833
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,079
idea of what's called the print camera a

834
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,960
watermarking technology and

835
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,679
the last one is again kind of combining

836
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,960
um natural proteins and biopolymers and

837
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,679
then idea is again we want to encode

838
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,280
some information there using the

839
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
patterns

840
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
and then we can have some matrix called

841
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,520
similar to a bar chord and qr codes um

842
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,239
so that's what we have done

843
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
some potential applications definitely

844
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,040
uh we can use these for serialization

845
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
track and trace and

846
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
anti-counterfeit measures and also the

847
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
uh we're really interested in on those

848
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,079
or in those authentication

849
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,200
and we see some immediate application in

850
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
pharmaceutical hospital pharmacy

851
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
settings again they have to

852
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,160
separate all the pills and then they

853
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,599
have different

854
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,520
single unit or unit dose packages so we

855
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,560
can maybe uh can help the process using

856
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,079
for example

857
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,880
increased printing technologies

858
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,599
and from uh from patients perspective uh

859
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,520
we want to see that actually our

860
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
patients and users play a big role um

861
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,720
against uh you know combating

862
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
counterfeit medicine so uh hopefully if

863
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
we have a really good smartphone

864
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
readability then

865
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
patients can play a role and definitely

866
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
uh

867
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,119
we are not sure exactly but uh uh

868
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,280
envisioning there's some other uh

869
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,359
cryptographic and security protocols

870
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,560
that um

871
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,079
it's more like a

872
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,160
movie after you read the information you

873
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,880
have to destroy this right away one way

874
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,680
is just take it and then

875
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,400
we can just remove right away um so

876
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,160
if there's any kind of potential

877
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
applications

878
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,880
just uh let us know

879
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,359
and as you can see uh the pharmaceutical

880
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,400
supply chain is really complex and from

881
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
a single lab it's really hard to

882
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,359
navigate and so we are really open to

883
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,720
have collaborations and partnerships and

884
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,839
etc

885
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,200
and the whole

886
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,680
idea about this uh pharmaceutical

887
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,839
anti-counterfeit technology started from

888
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
a side project in the lab but we

889
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
realized it's really good direction to

890
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,800
uh pursue so we're actively working on

891
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,880
and i want to thank my land members

892
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,200
samsung collaborators in particular uh

893
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
john lima he really pioneered many

894
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,040
different technologies for including

895
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,720
optical puff

896
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
and i want to thank some of our funding

897
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,800
opportunities in particular i want to

898
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,839
thank the u.s air force so initially we

899
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,960
got funding for hardware security from

900
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
u.s air force and then have you realized

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
this pharmaceutical it's a really big

902
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,720
domain so we kind of deviated a little

903
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
bit from my initial

904
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
uh kind of proposed idea and that's why

905
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
i my funding um wasn't renewed but i'm

906
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
so glad that due to their funding i got

907
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
into this domain and also we identified

908
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
the really critical um the research area

909
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,839
of anti-counterfeit pharmaceutical on

910
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,160
medicine so with that i thank you again

911
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,720
for this opportunity and i'll be around

912
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
so that we can have more discussions

913
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,839
thank you

914
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,799
thank you dr kim

915
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,480
you
