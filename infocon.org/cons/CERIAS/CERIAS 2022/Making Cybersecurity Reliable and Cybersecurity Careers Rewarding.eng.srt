1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
good afternoon welcome to the serious

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,799
weekly seminar at Purdue University uh

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,120
before we get started I want to let

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,919
everybody know that if you'd like to

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,500
submit a question you can do so by using

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
the Q a button it's my great pleasure to

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,960
introduce our speakers for today Dr

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,359
Brian barnier has pioneered critical

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,279
systems and Industrial design thinking

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,500
in the cyber security discipline he's

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,080
the co-founder of the think design cyber

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,779
Institute he's also author of The

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,359
operational risk handbook and has been

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,098
quoted and interviewed numerous times by

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,640
many mainstream media organizations

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
prachi kale is a co-founder of think

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,879
design cyber and is a founding executive

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,940
fellow of the Cyber Theory Institute her

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,680
career spans multiple disciplines

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
focusing on cyber security and Tech

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,079
business strategy diversity and

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,480
inclusion and Executive coaching today

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,020
the talk is about making cyber security

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,340
reliable and cyber security careers

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,739
rewarding Brian and prachi thank you so

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,660
much for joining us today please take it

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,780
away

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,299
thank you Mike

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,220
um Brian the floor is yours take it away

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,760
hello everybody

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,439
thank you for getting me off mute Mike

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,020
so what we're talking about today is

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,299
this notion of how we can make cyber

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,180
security reliable in cyber careers more

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,780
rewarding and this is going to draw on a

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,000
lot of your Midwest background and your

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,640
Purdue background but first just to

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,500
frame this a little bit

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,840
and with a hat tip to

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,299
professor spafford and his new book

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,479
which is just great

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,640
so we're going to consider these

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
questions critical questions in the

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,439
spirit of professor spafford's book

45
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,720
so why is there so much burnout and

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,659
stress among cyber professionals and yet

47
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,680
why are incidents and breaches occurring

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,119
despite all the years we've spent on

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,840
this

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,619
and why more interestingly does root

51
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,899
cause analysis show that most breaches

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,140
are self-inflicted due to errors in the

53
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,420
math and method that are used by cyber

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,520
Pros

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,500
and what specific

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,580
Ally helps or contributes to cyberpro's

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,580
feeling set up to fail in the surveys

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,239
and then lastly why aren't cyber Pros

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,660
supported as well as Professionals in

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,140
other disciplines and this again big hat

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,840
tip to Professor spafford's new book

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,300
where he's going to be it he is

63
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,980
addressing a lot of the things that

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,120
we're talking about

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,400
and I don't know why the light just

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,620
turned off

67
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,519
uh so

68
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,720
um so here is Purdue and here is

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,680
the Purdue train and it's just a mascot

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,580
and everything you need to know about

71
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,680
the backgrounds and what's going on here

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
can be taken in cyber security can be

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,159
taken from this photo because this is a

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,739
machine it's a system that works

75
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,040
together to produce a result and that's

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,500
what we're going to be keying into here

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,260
in this conversation

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,420
so just keep that in mind

79
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,420
and as we go through this we'll be

80
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,420
reviewing the critical thinking systems

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,580
thinking and industrial strength design

82
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,040
thinking that you're all exposed to at

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,500
Purdue and when I say industrial

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,560
strength design thinking that has has a

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,620
specific meaning to it and that is that

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,620
it's different than what you may be

87
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,900
familiar with for user experience or

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,860
human centered this also includes

89
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,580
how it's manufactured how it's used by

90
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
real people how it's supported and

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
serviced by real people and yes also the

92
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,519
Aesthetics to make it nice

93
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,239
so let's just do a little level set here

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,299
first of all on critical thinking with

95
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,600
percent professor spafford's book about

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,478
myths and misconceptions and I love that

97
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,900
title because there is so much folklore

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,280
that's out there in the cyber security

99
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,300
land

100
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,120
and then here's your Purdue systems

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,500
collaboratory and which this program is

102
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,960
already participating in is part of a

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,199
project with Boeing and notice the

104
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,020
systems thinking here at the bottom this

105
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,100
is where we're bringing together

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,740
critical thinking systems thinking and

107
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,720
design thinking all in a package

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,880
more on system syncing

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,120
this is W oderts Deming and Purdue was

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,479
hosted Deming Institute conferences

111
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,300
at you know this building

112
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,120
just three points about Deming first of

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
all the common causes what key term

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,280
common causes but you also might have

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,340
heard that as structural flaws these are

116
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,880
things that are designed into a method a

117
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,479
system a process that sets people up for

118
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,639
failure or success

119
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,860
and in deming's view like 98 almost

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,100
everything was a designed and thing that

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,699
set up workers for failure

122
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,860
um

123
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,660
W's Deming had a mentor named Walter

124
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,199
schuhart and together they did the plan

125
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,539
do study act cycle which you may be

126
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,660
familiar with from other methods it's

127
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,720
part of isaka's cobit for example and

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,639
then Demi had his system of building

129
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,500
knowledge he called it profound

130
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,400
knowledge but he created a system to

131
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,680
help people understand the systems in

132
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,380
which they were working very powerful

133
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,600
stuff and we'll be echoing that as we go

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,080
along and by the way Deming was a farm

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,139
boy from Iowa

136
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,919
now Tata Peru Purdue I especially in the

137
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,560
stats department is the Ishikawa or

138
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,780
fishbone diagram and this has been

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,300
diagnosing problems for literally

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,100
decades

141
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,979
and it's my favorite of the systems and

142
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,520
root cause analysis techniques because

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,639
it has this fishbone for the environment

144
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,039
and that's very important to understand

145
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,919
the environment as we'll see as we step

146
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,560
through this so step one is to

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,300
understand the environment

148
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,180
what is the nature of the system in

149
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,639
systems thinking and systems engineering

150
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,440
and system science there are various

151
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
dimensions

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
we're going to briefly go through that

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,100
but if you don't understand the nature

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
of the system then you are absolutely

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,039
set up to fail when it comes time to

156
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
select the methods because the methods

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,139
are inappropriate for the system

158
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,319
think about having a boast ring for a

159
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,979
violin in a saxophone the methods are

160
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,380
inappropriate or having the wrong sports

161
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,460
gear

162
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,220
and don't go playing

163
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,120
uh hockey with equipment for football

164
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,819
you've got to have those aligned now the

165
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,280
methods then Cascade into the

166
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,220
appropriate data and measures to both

167
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,520
diagnose and track your progress and

168
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,860
then that Cascades in selecting the

169
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,620
equipment and in cyber you can think of

170
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,919
all the Myriad of Point solutions that

171
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,020
are out there over four thousand or five

172
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,699
thousand is brought you will mention in

173
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,660
a minute

174
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,139
now when we go through these steps what

175
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,139
is absolutely vital is the system's

176
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,240
understanding sets up the method sets up

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,479
the measures and sets up the equipment

178
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,360
if this is done right people are set up

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,199
for Success if this is done wrong people

180
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,259
are set up for failure and this is a

181
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,280
vital important point to take from all

182
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,580
of your Purdue education and all of the

183
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,699
Midwest Industrial mindset

184
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,360
foreign

185
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,500
when we bring this mindset

186
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,719
in industrial strength design thinking

187
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,000
then we can see

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
things like Henry Ford Academy in

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Dearborn Michigan your own locomotive

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
and then Lewis Sullivan style

191
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,540
architecture in Chicago he was a Pioneer

192
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,220
and still girder building construction

193
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,360
in a giant in industrial strength design

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,600
thinking but it's not just the Midwest

195
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,140
we go way out to Silicon Valley and

196
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,019
here's Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with

197
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,420
this quote that prachi found that I love

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,480
see systems thinking is about how it

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,660
works well Steve Jobs

200
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,240
Blended that with design thinking and

201
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,540
said design is how it works so this is

202
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,519
just absolutely vital and here they're

203
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,220
holding a hardware board for an early

204
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,800
Apple computer yeah and Brian just one

205
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
more Point here we're bringing all these

206
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,620
Concepts to you right now the invitation

207
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,920
for the audience here is to look at the

208
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,440
idea of fixing cyber security through

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,140
the lens of design Thinking by learning

210
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,940
how to think like a designer again many

211
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,700
of you may be familiar with this the

212
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,100
notion is not to become a designer but

213
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,440
to understand how complex problems are

214
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,480
broken down into its components using

215
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,580
design Thinking by understanding how it

216
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,160
works and then applying other Concepts

217
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,680
and methods so in order to challenge

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,060
assumptions look at things with

219
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,320
different lenses Brian is going to

220
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
elaborate that in a little bit

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,880
and then understand how you can apply

222
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,399
the design thinking process itself in

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,519
order to formulate the solutions that

224
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,660
apply

225
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,880
um and suitable and are suitable to your

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
organizations whenever you get back

227
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
there if you're already working

228
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,360
part-time that too applies

229
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
um and then go from there I just wanted

230
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,380
to make that point Brian

231
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,160
all right so there's lots of examples of

232
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,580
success in design thinking in Industries

233
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,040
and in professional disciplines I'll

234
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,140
just point out two here to highlight

235
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,140
them one you can go on Netflix and view

236
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,320
the Disney Pixar story this is about the

237
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,700
design of the methods to design the

238
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,000
first CG film Toy Story and about the

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,579
design of the business model when Disney

240
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,860
originally showed Jon Lasseter the door

241
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,560
for wanting to do CG and then they

242
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,880
bought Pixar

243
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,220
the other one that's a movie is

244
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,459
McDonald's just up the way in Chicago

245
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,440
and if you watch the movie the founder

246
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,220
uh where Michael Keaton

247
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,160
then look for the basketball court scene

248
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,620
where they're designing the kitchen

249
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,620
and that is absolutely awesome lots of

250
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,740
design elements and by the way Chipotle

251
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,380
prachi and I were in SoCal not too long

252
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,959
ago Chipotle and all these other

253
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,120
Starbucks are all following in the

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,180
footsteps of what Ray Kroc did is played

255
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,000
by Michael Keaton yeah and the the idea

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,700
Brian just one point there that I wanted

257
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,740
to punch was design thinking for

258
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
business models and great Innovative

259
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,360
products Works amazing from a cyber

260
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,339
security perspective again the

261
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,560
invitation here is to look at it from a

262
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,600
process and operations it's also applied

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,700
to leadership organizational change and

264
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,760
culture and that's the area where we're

265
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,500
talking about gaps in cyber security

266
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,779
that makes it unreliable as we're seeing

267
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,640
it today and and something I wanted to

268
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
say cyber security the word itself has

269
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
become an oxymoron right cyber

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,140
insecurity just doesn't jive anymore

271
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,880
um and then the culture aspected on

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,399
creating a culture of security within an

273
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
organization and even within the Cyber C

274
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,899
Security Department as many of you may

275
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,440
end up end up in in your roles in the

276
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
future

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,260
all right

278
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,399
so

279
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,120
is probably just foreshadowed there's a

280
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,060
whole bunch of

281
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,480
accelerators Innovation labs foundries

282
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,760
that you walk past on campus every day

283
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,700
and look at the range and diversity of

284
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,600
these

285
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,680
these are all part of what you can draw

286
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
on and how you can enrich Yourself by

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,740
understanding how these problems are

288
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,100
solved with critical thinking systems

289
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,279
thinking and design thinking but again

290
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,740
had to Professor Stafford because it all

291
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,480
starts with that critical thinking

292
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,540
that's part of his book

293
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,800
so

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,180
drawing on your Purdue toolkit your

295
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,040
knowledge building

296
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,920
we'll preview these questions as we go

297
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,620
through what makes work difficult for

298
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,660
cyber Pros we already saw a little bit

299
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,019
about that in the Ishikawa diagram and

300
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,459
what causes

301
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,740
incidents and breaches again the

302
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,399
Ishikawa diagram can be replied or

303
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,860
be applied to these various areas

304
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,040
so prachi the slide

305
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,899
so this slide we're going to show you a

306
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,200
series of images and reflect on these as

307
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,160
they start popping up on um the screen

308
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,540
5000 plus vendor Point products

309
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,300
constrained resources hamster wheels

310
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,320
utility mistrusting infighting silos

311
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
work life conflict stress and burnout

312
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,899
group thinking conformity

313
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,240
I'd invite folks in the chat just to

314
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
just to point out what they think are

315
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,860
the highest issue is the most prevalent

316
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,800
issue in cyber security feel free to put

317
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,959
it in chat or you know unmute your

318
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,839
speakers and just shout it out but these

319
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,660
are issues that have been reported most

320
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,760
widely by cyber security people managers

321
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,459
across the industry across the globe and

322
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,079
we are collecting data on this in our

323
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
academic survey just to just to identify

324
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,579
which one of these are the highest ones

325
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,899
they all exist in different

326
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,300
organizations

327
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,980
um

328
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,839
the point here is I'm going to see if

329
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
somebody puts it in chat or not but the

330
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,579
point here is these are all issues that

331
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,560
have nothing to do with technology and

332
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,180
nothing to do directly with threats and

333
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,959
attacks these are what we call symptoms

334
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,579
absolutely zuhair thank you for adding

335
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,699
stress and burnout 100

336
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,320
um and

337
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,959
and without solving these so again these

338
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,019
are symptoms that are people are solving

339
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,040
um

340
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,100
Drew says plus one thank you that people

341
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,199
are looking to do but have nothing to do

342
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,880
with what's going on in the threat and

343
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,260
that you know the threatened attacks and

344
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,240
the adversarial word so what is going on

345
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,399
we started looking and our work started

346
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,680
happening when in my experience in the

347
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
cyber security industry I've managed you

348
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
know over 150 million dollars worth of

349
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,459
Investments over a number of years and

350
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,380
constantly the problem was not the

351
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,639
threats and attacks and the outside

352
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,399
issues the problems are always internal

353
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,500
I mean I've acquired teams and

354
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,120
stakeholders and some very set of

355
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,339
unhappy stakeholders several times and

356
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,899
it had nothing to do with how many how

357
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,639
well we implemented Point Solutions or

358
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,720
peripheral

359
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,060
um security products so

360
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,980
moving on from here we started looking

361
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,680
under the hood and just one point to

362
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,459
note

363
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,980
um I invite everybody again zuhair as

364
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,019
you mentioned heidrichin struggles great

365
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,880
survey go out and look at it it was

366
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,500
published two months ago two or three

367
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,820
months ago

368
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,500
um and then the key point to point here

369
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,560
was csos today rightfully so great

370
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,980
stress and burnout over their

371
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,980
um their issue of facing job loss in

372
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,040
case of a breach so that affirms

373
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
um the survey we're doing and we're

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,639
getting ready to publish that study as

375
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,860
well so Brian back to you

376
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,120
all right so just a few mechanics here

377
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,240
think of any incident or breach is it

378
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,899
already in the minor attack chart

379
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,779
and tragically so many of these are this

380
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,760
is solarwindsorion

381
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,480
on the left a bit from cisa and then I

382
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,579
did a call out on the motor attack chart

383
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,699
so if it's already there why do we keep

384
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,339
having these breaches and here's another

385
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,300
view

386
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,980
we've got all these certifications

387
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,440
Frameworks and controls several of these

388
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,019
I've contributed to

389
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,579
but

390
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,060
what I wanted to point out is that

391
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,040
these are different

392
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,160
these are different because most of

393
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,000
these are based on bookkeeping checks

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,679
where they're going through and saying

395
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,199
checklist checklist checklist and one of

396
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,419
the things that infuriates us working on

397
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,880
these is you know we labored on the

398
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,640
initial you know 10 12 pages and then

399
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,280
you know the checklist we just add to

400
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
and nobody reads the first 10 12 Pages

401
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,740
they just jump to the checklist and do

402
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,600
it so all the stuff that we wrote about

403
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,360
systems thinking and everything is a

404
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,140
mess

405
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,860
for example I was on cobit and we really

406
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,559
tried to broaden the scope because a

407
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,640
framework

408
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,799
the definition of our framework is a

409
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,140
comprehensive understanding of a system

410
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,080
or others say a phenomenon depends on

411
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,179
the discipline you're in but not in

412
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,860
cyber security we've got all these

413
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,720
things called Frameworks that really

414
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,620
aren't

415
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,260
I suck a cobit on our team we tried to

416
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,660
make it broad it's not always as

417
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,059
detailed because we just build Bridges

418
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,679
to

419
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,340
um

420
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,780
uh service management or our I.T

421
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,500
architecture framework or the um project

422
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,179
management

423
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,860
so and then the nist 800 160 fabulous

424
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,380
piece of work spearheaded by Ron Ross at

425
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,260
niss and what that does is it looks at

426
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,500
secure systems engineering tying into an

427
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,059
ISO framework

428
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,860
and but it's not ISO

429
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,559
27001 no that's a bookkeeping checklist

430
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,179
what it ties off to is an ISO IEEE

431
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,600
uh systems engineering framework and so

432
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,059
I encourage you to look that up but I've

433
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,580
got stories about all of these but the

434
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,380
point is is that

435
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,660
our framework needs to be comprehensive

436
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,299
to have that Deming Ishikawa Midwest

437
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,280
industrial strength design thinking

438
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,039
Steve Jobs View and all these things

439
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,919
that are commonly called Frameworks do

440
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,080
not have that and now we'll go to

441
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
controls but prachi

442
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,640
I think I've got to point out yeah so

443
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,400
just this The Narrative that has become

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
popular in in today's you know news

445
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,500
outlets and media in amongst you know

446
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,660
general population is that every breach

447
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,820
is sophistic more sophisticated than the

448
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,340
last one and that's a fallacy right as

449
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,100
we start to look into what happened I

450
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,559
mean any breach as Brian said is

451
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,500
self-inflicted so what is going on why

452
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,660
is it that this is happening despite all

453
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,400
these certifications Frameworks and

454
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,500
controls and what can we do about it

455
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,480
right again if my symptoms of

456
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
non-indered with technology my breaches

457
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
are pretty straightforward what is going

458
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,360
on it's obviously symptomatic of

459
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,679
something deeper something more

460
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,780
foundational something more obscure that

461
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,000
people are not able to see and and and

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,860
you know get their hands or heads and

463
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,720
hands wrapped around

464
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,039
all right

465
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,580
so uh Fred Cohen also a midwesterner

466
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,980
from Ohio

467
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,020
um you said there's only two things that

468
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,900
attackers have to do one is identify the

469
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
assumptions

470
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,220
and then violate them and when the

471
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,260
assumptions are made around weak

472
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,059
Frameworks and weak controls as we'll

473
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,740
see in a moment

474
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,679
this is pretty easy and another thing

475
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,720
that prachi and I talk about is all

476
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,460
you've got to do

477
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,340
as an attacker is gold watch old movies

478
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,799
on Netflix and eat popcorn and you come

479
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,500
up with lots of ideas

480
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,900
uh for attack vectors

481
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,880
um you know think about every

482
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,620
infrastructure attack

483
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,840
that is you know 1960 version of Ocean's

484
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,419
11 with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr

485
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,500
so this is not hard for the attackers at

486
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,539
all

487
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,299
and then here's a question that I asked

488
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,600
in uh big audiences where I got three

489
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,120
500 people how many

490
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,580
people are actually focused on the

491
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,900
attackers

492
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,000
versus how many people are trackers

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,100
checking Checkers checking checkers

494
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,280
and then this is a big problem in cyber

495
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,200
security today and it's completely

496
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,140
opposite of what Mr Toyota said

497
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,640
uh

498
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
Mr Deming and Mr Ishikawa

499
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,320
this is a just a huge resource waste

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,840
when so much resources consumed

501
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,820
internally instead of focused on the

502
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,220
enemy and the checkers checking Checkers

503
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,620
checking Checkers is really the lines of

504
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,179
Defense model where we're talking about

505
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,700
the first like second third line it

506
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,799
works well from a compliance standpoint

507
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,200
but what essentially we've observed is

508
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,260
it puts brilliant resources against each

509
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,419
other for the purposes of cyber security

510
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,820
when you want to look at I mean aside

511
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,620
from Insider risk but when you want to

512
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,320
start looking at compliance related

513
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,419
issues or fraud and things like that

514
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,400
that makes sense but for cyber security

515
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,340
it was adopted but it doesn't make sense

516
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,559
because now I have a brilliant I.T

517
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,860
Network expert fighting with a risk

518
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,780
assessor and then both of them getting

519
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,880
beaten up by an audit folks when my

520
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,340
attacker is outside the organization and

521
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,860
that results in that internal antagonism

522
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,980
one of the biggest things I coach my

523
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,080
clients in and these are senior cyber

524
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,620
Executives more aspiring executives

525
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,020
um and people managers are having a hard

526
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,640
time bridging that connection with the

527
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,080
partners because on the one side you're

528
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,360
assessing them and on the other side you

529
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,740
know you want to partner with them to

530
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,419
come up with solutions to make your

531
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,659
transformation more secure or to go

532
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,600
um you know or go toward the bad guys

533
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
actors

534
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
okay

535
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,400
so again with a hat tip from Professor

536
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,659
spafford

537
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,480
these hazards and pitfalls which is the

538
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,820
subtitlement of his book can be revealed

539
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,580
with critical thinking

540
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,220
we at the notion of how do we look at

541
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,559
the problem and that's project we'll

542
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,480
talk later about having diverse High

543
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,600
performing teams to look at all aspects

544
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,419
of the product or the problem and then

545
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,760
we've got these uh pieces from the

546
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
organizational behavior profession in

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
literature structural blindness and

548
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,380
cognitive bias so structures are about

549
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,600
the way we design our organizations the

550
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,460
way we design our information flows

551
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,200
anything that we design about our

552
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,960
organization that blocks communication

553
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,240
Innovation and then we've got the

554
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,960
cognitive biases like groupthink that

555
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,600
Professor spafford has in his book and

556
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,419
outdated methods so his references to

557
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,200
myths and misconceptions it is already

558
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
teed up these are problems that Tech

559
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,720
absolutely positively cannot solve

560
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,020
so let me walk you through an example of

561
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,720
something that we do with professionals

562
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,600
then I frame it by understanding what a

563
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,720
real control is and this is a control

564
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,600
from over 200 years ago for a steam

565
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,059
engine so very relevant to Boilermakers

566
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,679
and locomotives

567
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,140
but

568
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,960
to keep this steam engine from blowing

569
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
up or the boiler from blowing up these

570
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,179
balls start spinning around and around

571
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,299
and they release the more energy is

572
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,400
pushed to them the more released they

573
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,159
release pressure from inside the boiler

574
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,460
so no big explosion

575
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,820
this is a control a real control and

576
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,039
automated control from over 200 years

577
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,039
ago but what we have mostly in cyber

578
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,100
security are bookkeeping checks imported

579
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,860
from the audit profession not the

580
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,980
automated controls

581
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,620
in all those things that we go through

582
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,140
and burn all and waste our time on

583
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,360
so we do these outcomes accelerator

584
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
workshops and this one I picked is just

585
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,580
the controls chain of Fitness because

586
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,080
it's just

587
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,860
um

588
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,460
uh convenient for a lot of people and

589
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,520
what we discover is that when we do this

590
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
with you know people at their table

591
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,220
teams is that most controls are not

592
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,039
efficient or effective now why is this

593
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,799
is because they're not using systems

594
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,080
thinking they're just taking and going

595
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,779
down the checklist of bookkeeping stuff

596
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,360
they're not looking at the whole

597
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,659
controls chain everything necessary to

598
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,059
make the locomotive go down the tracks

599
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,860
and not explode

600
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,919
so failing in systems thinking and then

601
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,279
systems math is not done and this is one

602
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,440
of the very frustrating things for cyber

603
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,179
professionals who've been in the

604
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,179
discipline since the early 2000s because

605
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,120
it used to be the same systems math and

606
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,159
systems reliability math that was done

607
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,659
for

608
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,380
um

609
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,799
I.T availability continuity all this

610
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,679
kind of stuff think

611
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,419
Black Friday coming up think Cyber

612
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,340
Monday coming up all this kind of stuff

613
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,799
although this year all the sales started

614
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,500
earlier but that's the kind of math that

615
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,559
will be done and this is not being done

616
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,659
in cyber security

617
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,720
and then the outcomes first of all this

618
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,020
is a very empowering to people because

619
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,940
it gives them the tools and we've got

620
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,640
more than these two tools but these are

621
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,460
the two main ones it empowers them to

622
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,159
make decisions with confidence whereas

623
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,500
they all know they don't have confidence

624
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,380
in the accounting and bookkeeping checks

625
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,059
that they're being told to do

626
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,100
the other big piece is that management

627
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,580
loves it because finally management can

628
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,700
see risk the way they see risk in

629
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,000
product management and operations in

630
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
manufacturing customer service Marketing

631
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,220
sales financed everywhere else in the

632
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,200
business where risk is tied to outcomes

633
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,960
not the stuff that we normally do in

634
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,419
cyber security

635
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:18,080
so if you could put up our poll Mike

636
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,779
what's the reality of this system in

637
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,120
which cyber security lives is it linear

638
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,059
stable or is it complex and dynamic and

639
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,980
I've just put some of the other

640
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,140
attributes down here

641
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,299
and then we've got another poll coming

642
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,539
up on introverts and extroverts and you

643
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,140
can also answer this that will be uh

644
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,980
part of what prachi will present in a

645
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,220
little bit

646
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,620
but this is an important thing this goes

647
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,740
back to the Ishikawa diagram and Mike

648
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,900
whenever you see sufficient answers

649
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,740
going you can push this and I have to

650
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,559
smile because I'm a victim of design

651
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,720
thinking I've got to move my chair or

652
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,020
stand up uh because this is a Leed

653
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,640
certified building and they always want

654
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
to turn the lights off

655
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,679
so Mike do we have enough answers in and

656
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,320
we can progress

657
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,179
uh yeah absolutely we've got a 71

658
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:25,500
participation here all right great

659
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,539
what does the answer look like Mike for

660
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,880
the first question first question uh 17

661
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,240
answered the first one and 83 for

662
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,820
complex Dynamics

663
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,240
right so complex Dynamic is what we're

664
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,260
after

665
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,659
and the

666
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:51,059
um it is a very different uh form of

667
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:51,900
things

668
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,279
the

669
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,520
when you bring in auditing procedures

670
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,679
everybody's got name badges that you're

671
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,419
trying to get they're cheating on their

672
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,580
expensed accounts they're accelerating

673
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,460
sales they may be paying bribes to a

674
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,140
foreign power

675
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,140
this is very different than when the

676
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,120
enemies are unknown and emerging and

677
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,659
there's no rules and so this is where

678
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,299
the Ishikawa

679
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:23,059
peace really is so super helpful

680
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,580
all right and this Bridges us to

681
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,100
controls because bookkeeping controls

682
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,039
and automated systems methods are very

683
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,179
different

684
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,520
bookkeeping you're looking you're doing

685
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,360
reporting in the past in a stable highly

686
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,179
rules-based system from the SEC down to

687
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,039
fasby and everything

688
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,039
and your high-end threat is you know

689
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,559
bribes embezzling

690
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,700
by contrast for Aviation much less cyber

691
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,559
security

692
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,240
your future

693
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,940
performance in a different type of

694
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,980
system and with the high-end threat

695
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,980
being cyber warfare

696
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,419
so what is this summarize into

697
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,640
a wrong assumption about the nature of

698
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,159
the system leads to a wrong assumption

699
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,799
about the methods

700
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,419
these do wrong

701
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,820
math leads to wrong text selected as Tom

702
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,580
Holland at Forester once called it

703
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,620
expense and depth where people are

704
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,480
buying all these products that don't

705
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
interoperate very well and fail a whole

706
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,159
bunch of tests and they set up cyber

707
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,539
Pros to fail

708
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,260
now what I've done just here is I've

709
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,659
just walked through the Ishikawa diagram

710
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,340
for you

711
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,100
boom so this is how powerful that is and

712
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,899
I when I was looking up on the Purdue

713
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,840
website somebody's even animated it for

714
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,919
you

715
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,960
but this is a meme

716
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,720
and this has been a meme for years and

717
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,700
years and years you know

718
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,299
almost a century and this Charlie

719
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,240
Chaplin one was just put up in three

720
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,360
years ago and it's got you know almost

721
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
76 million hits and it's been done over

722
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,860
and over and over again

723
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,500
the point I'm making starting out with

724
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,020
the Purdue locomotive is that it's in

725
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,360
produce blood to improve it's in your

726
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,840
DNA because of these methods

727
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,200
and it's all available to you to make a

728
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,299
difference when you're in competitions

729
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,880
or when you're applying for jobs so

730
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,360
project learn change and potential yeah

731
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,779
so what we've covered so far in depth

732
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,360
and very fast so reach out to us if you

733
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,399
have follow-up questions

734
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,039
um is set up the what of the problem and

735
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,640
uh why it's happening and some Concepts

736
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,039
that we've applied and some you know

737
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,020
ideas from great thinkers who really

738
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,179
transform other Industries with their

739
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,340
novel ideas at the time and now common

740
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,220
practice and so by knowing the what and

741
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,559
the why the how becomes simpler

742
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,779
and that goes a lot with analyticals

743
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,419
here so we're using the what in the Y

744
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,039
and now we're going to go into how about

745
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,899
how did we come how did we sort of

746
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,140
compile our suite of solutions

747
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,299
um into solving these problems is once

748
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,279
we discovered we walked through the you

749
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,080
know cause analysis and our minds were

750
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,600
blown really around what is going on and

751
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,700
so what happened how do people learn and

752
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,860
how do people change

753
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,059
um knowing that what and the why is

754
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,460
helpful and how is really the process of

755
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,740
changing what we've learned so far

756
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,020
unlearning that and learning new things

757
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,760
and then

758
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,640
that leads to obviously all of us having

759
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,679
our goals and aspirations our true

760
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,440
purpose and for me true potential as a

761
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,679
coach that's what I help people get to

762
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,960
um through the process that we've put

763
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,820
together Brian next slide

764
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,840
so this is a poll that we were going to

765
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,700
ask about the introvert or extrovert mic

766
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,720
I don't know if you've already got

767
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,399
answers to that one

768
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,260
yes I do

769
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,399
so we have uh 65 introvert and 35

770
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,019
extrovert

771
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,059
amazing so that just proved my point

772
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,100
what we have not covered so far are the

773
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,260
personality types in cyber security

774
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,019
so introverts congratulations you are in

775
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,360
large numbers in cyber security

776
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,519
um and as a world population you know we

777
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,919
and I say myself I'm an ambient excuse

778
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,019
introvert um Brian is a die-hard

779
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,399
introvert

780
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,279
um but we're in large numbers in cyber

781
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,260
security and the way the discipline is

782
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,600
evolving and the way our roles are

783
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,940
changing and the pressures it's it's

784
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,700
having actually it's a great opportunity

785
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,440
for introverts to step up because we're

786
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,240
naturally creative we're naturally good

787
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,580
problem solvers and we're naturally good

788
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,440
at leading which sometimes feels as

789
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,019
amidst to people or just like it's like

790
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,580
a mind trick but that is essentially

791
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,799
true so we're also looking at the

792
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,480
Personalities in cyber security

793
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,279
personality types in cyber security

794
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,899
excuse me

795
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,299
um and and infusing that into some of

796
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,520
our solutioning there and I personally

797
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
work with a lot of introverts helping

798
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,699
them with their personal brand with

799
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,918
their networking and helping them become

800
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,099
more visible and vocal in boardrooms and

801
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,199
in um senior meetings

802
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,320
right next slide please

803
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
and so what is the point of all of this

804
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,179
right so if you're looking at looking at

805
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,099
it all collectively we're looking at the

806
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,800
personality types and then

807
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,060
and then

808
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,580
um how us collectively you and I in

809
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,199
going back into the industry in our

810
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,719
daily jobs are infusing curiosity and

811
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,639
the design mindset

812
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,918
and then really using critical thinking

813
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,418
systems thinking design thinking

814
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,520
together and applying that to formulate

815
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,918
solutions that don't exist today

816
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,139
Ryan next slide right and unless you

817
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,800
have any comments

818
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,780
okay keep going and so

819
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,339
um how we build knowledge in daily life

820
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,900
we touched upon this a little bit on the

821
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,760
damning side so this is how we have

822
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
formulated again some of the things

823
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,300
we're doing with introverts extroverts

824
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,160
and the design thinking process one is

825
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,660
the foundation these are pretty much

826
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,260
your 101 201 level you know wide breadth

827
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,480
of knowledge or courses that we have

828
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,220
created Brian and I are just about to

829
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,900
launch of course on design thinking for

830
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,700
cyber security so that's sort of the

831
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,680
foundational knowledge about these

832
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,720
problems and how to apply these and some

833
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,640
use cases that are out there

834
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
the second step to this one really is

835
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,839
the important one that has never been

836
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,940
done in cyber security before is to

837
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,500
offer

838
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,680
um coaching that is completely tailored

839
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,500
for cyber security needs and demands for

840
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,660
people it you know sort of the entry to

841
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,880
senior level different different nuances

842
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
but think about this like is having

843
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,720
coaching for different sport you know

844
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,280
positions and different sports games

845
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,220
right or having specific coaches to help

846
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,980
you with your violin uh music just much

847
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,500
like this girl who's a Juilliard student

848
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,020
and then the third step

849
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,060
um is really about learning together

850
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,880
this is by far you're in a university

851
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,640
you can go research adult learning

852
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,560
really works well in a peer learning

853
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,079
format in in teams and in groups so

854
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,940
we've what Brian walked you through in

855
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,260
our case study where the outcomes

856
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,540
accelerator workshops where you come up

857
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,880
with Solutions together and this is

858
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,160
really important in learning how do you

859
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,920
bring in every individual person's

860
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,900
knowledge their talent their skills

861
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,180
their abilities and apply it to the pro

862
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,820
the problem solving process and how do

863
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,859
you when you're in a company in your

864
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,780
leading teams how you how do you

865
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,380
transform your um how do you transform

866
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,260
your team into a diverse High performing

867
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,300
team and be inclusive in your leadership

868
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,420
and and for introverts that is a classic

869
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,060
opportunity to really shine I think

870
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,800
we've been in the shadows so far you

871
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,480
know for a long time and this is really

872
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
our opportunity to step up to the plate

873
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,380
and step up to a very very strong

874
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,940
leadership today that cyber security

875
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,180
industry is screaming for

876
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,099
right next slide

877
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,320
I just wanted to point out the reference

878
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,740
to uh Deming and um you can go online to

879
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,560
Deming uh on the YouTube channel

880
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,760
and uh look up this red bead experiment

881
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,859
if you can't find it it's on the think

882
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,160
design cyber LinkedIn page but there's a

883
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,680
lot of versions of this but deming's is

884
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,560
so good because Deming brings in all

885
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,079
three of these elements and these are

886
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,140
used over and over and over again too

887
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,880
you know and I just want to acknowledge

888
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
there was a question in the chat which

889
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,839
we'll get to right after we close I just

890
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,640
wanted to make sure to let the the

891
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,099
person know that I did read it

892
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,900
it's on introverts

893
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,000
all right so

894
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,040
this is so rich and so powerful

895
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,280
all right so just to review in closing

896
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,720
here

897
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,440
um

898
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,720
we've got the burnout and stress the

899
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,400
incidents and breaches that are still

900
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,740
occurring but when we do the root cause

901
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,700
analysis most are self-inflicted it's

902
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
not a tech problem

903
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,520
and the methods set up cyber prose to

904
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,640
fail and it just wastes huge amounts of

905
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,160
resources think about schools and

906
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,500
hospitals and everybody else's has small

907
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,920
cyber security departments why waste so

908
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,700
many resources and then cyber Pros are

909
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,359
not empowered with all those Deming type

910
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,460
elements and it's not just Deming but

911
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,320
it's this whole school of thought

912
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,500
critical systems and design thinking

913
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,359
with those resources that are available

914
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,619
to them

915
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,560
but the good news is that that the

916
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,800
solution is straightforward it's a small

917
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,560
problem other professional disciplines

918
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,260
and it's not just methods back to

919
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,200
deming's point but it's how knowledge is

920
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,260
built and so one final hat tip to

921
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,200
Professor Stafford for his new book

922
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,720
because it all starts with critical

923
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,259
thinking

924
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,560
yeah so just a list of resources for

925
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,420
everybody who like to dig into more

926
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,700
information much like myself

927
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,380
um the operational risk handbook was

928
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,540
published by Brian about a decade ago

929
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,859
Brian now

930
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,480
um and has a lot of lot of good

931
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,619
information

932
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,660
um very foundational

933
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,940
um content to the work that we're doing

934
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,099
today for those of you who are

935
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,260
interested in the GRC space want to

936
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,240
learn more about controls and where all

937
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,420
our conversation was sort of based upon

938
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,280
is this great paper and why controls

939
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,839
have become wasteful again this is

940
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,640
several years ago

941
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,920
um is very popular article as well there

942
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,599
out there and our last two and most

943
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,079
recent paper cyber security the end game

944
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,820
um you know for Avengers fan just a

945
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,079
little bit there

946
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,020
um but uh we have outlined all the

947
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,880
structural flaws we covered controls and

948
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
a little bit on Frameworks but there are

949
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,540
some other ones in cyber you know in the

950
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,859
cyber security field that we have

951
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,599
identified and published this academic

952
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,540
paper so I invite all of you to see this

953
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,420
um and just as I wrap this up up

954
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,480
um I you know I use the word invitation

955
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,520
because it's really a choice what we

956
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,119
have offered to you today is a sort of

957
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,960
Deep dive or somewhat Deep dive into the

958
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,940
work that we're doing in solving cyber

959
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,579
security and making it reliable and in

960
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,440
turn making our careers rewarding right

961
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,780
there is no company today or no

962
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,760
organization that can make that claim

963
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,099
and we are jumping into this mission in

964
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,200
bringing it to

965
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,640
um to universities to different

966
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
organizations so we invite you to join

967
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,599
us in this mission go back and

968
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,880
self-reflect because many of you who are

969
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,500
not already working or who are and

970
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,180
aspiring to be leaders in cyber security

971
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,980
organizations

972
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,320
this is our opportunity to start driving

973
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,980
change and and start and stop that fun

974
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,320
approach of fear uncertainty doubt and

975
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,300
the ambulance chasing around you know

976
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,160
the next big breach or the next whatever

977
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,240
but really hone in hunker down and start

978
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,400
um working together and solving problems

979
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,619
that Tech cannot solve and then use

980
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,420
technology in a way that can solve the

981
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,920
problems that we're solving so that

982
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,200
those attackers and all those threats

983
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,940
out there don't get ahead of us so again

984
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,500
this is an invitation please

985
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,420
self-reflect um if you have any

986
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,220
questions we're available

987
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,079
um on LinkedIn Brian I think it's on the

988
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,700
next slide

989
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,160
um and uh we'd be happy to answer

990
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,780
questions or Mike you know if you want

991
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,579
to send them to us in email if you know

992
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,440
students ask you later we're happy to do

993
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,060
that as well

994
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,180
and just a plug to keep in touch with

995
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,079
your faculty oh yes there because

996
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,020
um this whole thing design cyber started

997
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,920
from a project that was inspired by my

998
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,900
former professor at Michigan Merle

999
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,839
Crawford and he contributed a chapter to

1000
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,420
the handbook and I built two other

1001
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,119
chapters off of that and 10 years later

1002
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,900
this is where we are so always stay in

1003
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,820
touch with your faculty and all the

1004
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,280
great ideas that you have

1005
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,619

1008
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,240

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,440
um sure

1010
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,079
so the question for those of you haven't

1011
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:31,680
um

1012
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,359
read it and again please be we'll

1013
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,400
welcome everybody to type in their in

1014
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,900
their chat or unmute when we're done

1015
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,339
with this one

1016
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,079
um but can you please explain how an

1017
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,820
introvert makes a better decision than

1018
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,700
an extrovert in solving problems

1019
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,720
um

1020
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,940
better decisions depending on the

1021
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,940
circumstance and the and the

1022
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,680
um situation obviously right so

1023
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,320
everything is based around situation and

1024
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,240
context so I want to preface my answer

1025
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,859
with that

1026
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:00,359
um if you go back to the slide on the

1027
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,460
introvert and extrovert Brian just you

1028
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,540
know I have a comparison there so the it

1029
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,400
submits that one makes better decisions

1030
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,980
than the other the opportunity is that

1031
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,140
introverts are naturally

1032
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,920
self-reflective and they are very

1033
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,440
intentional in decision making now that

1034
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,119
does not mean that all introverts know

1035
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,220
how to use that superpower or hidden

1036
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,200
power because most of the introverts

1037
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,520
think that they're socially awkward

1038
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,380
people who don't want to talk to people

1039
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,720
uh my sister is an introvert my best

1040
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,640
friend is an introvert Brian is an

1041
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,380
introvert I don't know how I managed to

1042
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,780
attract so many introverts in my life

1043
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,119
um and most of my team before I became

1044
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,920
the co-founder in the cypherd security

1045
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,599
space

1046
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,359
um are introverts um so a lot of my

1047
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,640
stakeholders are introverts but

1048
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,920
um so the idea is you're naturally

1049
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,200
self-reflective you're naturally bent

1050
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,339
towards

1051
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,920
um synthesizing problems in a in a

1052
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,599
different way right you take the time

1053
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,420
you look into things we look into and

1054
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,800
when I say you I mean everybody

1055
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,780
including myself

1056
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,880
we look at things in a more step-by-step

1057
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Manner and that contemplation gives us

1058
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,579
the ability to articulate or formulate

1059
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:14,040
our answers in a good way again that

1060
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,839
doesn't mean everybody knows how to use

1061
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,060
those innate Powers that's where I work

1062
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,680
with them in the coaching at least of

1063
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,359
the people who come to me for coaching

1064
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,280
to learn how to do that and that really

1065
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,800
starts to set yourself apart another

1066
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,079
free tip I'll give you is from a

1067
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,540
leadership standpoint a key aspect of

1068
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,980
leadership and you'll read this in many

1069
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,420
books and many of you will get this

1070
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,119
feedback is active listening and really

1071
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,460
being able to be

1072
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,780
um

1073
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,460
what's it called the eye of the storm

1074
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,819
when crisis happens and in that case

1075
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,520
also introverts naturally because our

1076
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,520
tendency to to listen to other people

1077
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,500
more than talk

1078
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,700
um or our

1079
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,980
our um Choice rather you know something

1080
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,260
we like to do is to talk less

1081
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,000
um naturally again gives us the

1082
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
ability to become good leaders leaders

1083
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,859
are born leaders are made that both can

1084
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,540
be true depending on what you make out

1085
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,180
of your situation is that helpful to not

1086
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,819
I it added that that there is also a

1087
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,280
technique called the q2q ratio which is

1088
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,619
a ratio of questions that you asked to

1089
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:26,400
learn

1090
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,500
versus the questions that are asked of

1091
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,520
you and people who are very directive

1092
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,440
they are telling people yes but it's

1093
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,500
look at Steve Jobs look at H Ross Pro

1094
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,660
look at Maniac question answers askers

1095
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,400
there's this great video of Steve Jobs

1096
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,240
out on YouTube and it's

1097
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,280
reflecting back years later on his first

1098
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,680
visit to the Xerox Palo Alto research

1099
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,099
facility and he said if I only stayed

1100
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:04,280
longer I was accelerated Apple by years

1101
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,099
but I didn't and that lesson stuck with

1102
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,160
me all my life so I was just a maniacal

1103
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,540
question asker ahross Pro the same way

1104
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,480
yep and others but that is where

1105
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,180
question asking

1106
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,280
becomes so important again to professor

1107
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,200
spafford's book

1108
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,819
not just

1109
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,440

00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,260
title of past book Brian

misconceptions

1163
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,540
um I went to the eye doctor a couple

1164
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,280
years ago because I was having a problem

1165
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,319
looking at a disc you know when the

1166
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,119
pixelated like at

1167
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:57,780
um

1168
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,119
uh at a subway station or like a train

1169
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,099
station where you have digital displays

1170
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,740
and it was Fuzzy for me I go to the

1171
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,140
doctor and you know she does the test on

1172
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,760
me with different lenses and suddenly

1173
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,740
when I there was this one lens one

1174
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,380
particular prescription rate

1175
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,859
um and suddenly it was it was all clear

1176
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:20,400
and she's and I said okay so what's this

1177
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,079
about and she said this is to prevent

1178
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,839
you from becoming short-sighted

1179
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:28,500
and that stayed with me a lot

1180
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,240
um because that was really when I put

1181
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,400
the right lens on I could see things in

1182
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,500
a much better better better way

1183
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,839
the point of that story was critical

1184
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,119
thinking is about picking up different

1185
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,160
lenses and looking through it looking

1186
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,859
through your problems any problem in

1187
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,079
life and the topic of today is cyber

1188
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,180
security but if you start using the

1189
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,040
right lenses try on different lenses

1190
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,660
you'll start to look at problems in

1191
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,460
different ways and that is going to

1192
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,140
differentiate you in your career like

1193
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,000
nobody else

1194
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,740
um this seems like a very simple thing

1195
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,380
but trust me when I say it it's only a

1196
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,480
few percentage of people who do that

1197
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,540
again from an introvert standpoint 65

1198
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,880
you're an introverts you naturally have

1199
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,680
the ability to do this so I would say

1200
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,740
nurture that ability and be open read

1201
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,900
professor spafford's book on critical

1202
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,400
thinking

1203
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,319
um understand what that means but that

1204
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,020
is absolutely a good metaphor is to put

1205
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,680
the lens on

1206
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,440
okay

1207
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,819
