1
00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:09,469
okay

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,150
welcome to the serious seminar class

3
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,799
today my name is Jerry Hahn and was

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,719
serious and it's my pleasure to

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,090
introduce Siyad Hussain

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,500
he's a postdoctoral researcher in the

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,009
department of computer science here at

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,290
Purdue

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,990
he's also where he also received his PhD

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,000
in December of 2018 his research

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,860
interest broadly line network and system

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,990
security with a focus on the fundamental

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,509
improvement of security and privacy and

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,640
analysis of emerging networks and

15
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,870
cyber-physical systems including

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,270
southerner networks and Internet of

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,519
Things his papers have received numerous

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,290
awards he's been inducted twice into the

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,110
Hall of Fame mobile security research

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,660
and his contribution identifying 20 or

21
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,629
more protocol flaws in 4G and 5g

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,640
cellular networks so with that I'll just

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,000
turn it over to side and let him get

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,440
started thank you thank you oh thank you

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,880
all for for having me here so today I'm

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,980
going to talk about automated reasoning

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,710
of security and privacy of cellular

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,619
networks so as you know that when

29
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,729
complex network protocols are designed

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,700
security is often considered as an

31
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:16,100
afterthought as a result of which there

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,290
are missing security and privacy

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,600
guarantees under specifications and

34
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,470
ambiguities in these technical designs

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,479
so these all these problems lead to the

36
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,479
critical vulnerabilities which the

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,390
adversary exploit and perform attacks to

38
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,250
the design and real deployments not only

39
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,380
that like we have seen when a new

40
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,979
generation protocol or system comes in

41
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,509
it grant it guarantees better security

42
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,810
posture than the previous generations

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,310
but many are the functional due to

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,619
backward compatibility many of the

45
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,299
functionalities have been adapted from

46
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,880
previous generations to new generations

47
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,340
as a result of which vulnerabilities in

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,339
those inherited components also exist in

49
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,079
new generations also there are new

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,119
security features for new generations

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,710
but those security features have not

52
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,520
been undergone rigorous security

53
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,759
evaluation

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,908
so all these vulnerabilities eventually

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,250
go down to the real deployments apart

56
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,780
from that we have seen that deployments

57
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,060
deviate from the technical design

58
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,370
specifications this is because of

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,290
like oversimplification of complex

60
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,260
network protocol specifications of poor

61
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,750
inputs and decisions so my research

62
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,250
address these problems with fundamental

63
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,020
enhancement in the investigation of

64
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,330
security and privacy analysis of a

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,489
system from starting from analyzing

66
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,319
technical designs evaluating

67
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,870
implementations and building high

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:45,560
assurance defenses so it towards this I

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,690
in my PhD I have worked on three closely

70
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,970
with such deductions first I have

71
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,550
developed formal verification frameworks

72
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,880
for analyzing the technical designs of

73
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,830
4G and 5g selector protocols secondly I

74
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,390
have also developed static and dynamic

75
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,800
analysis frameworks to evaluate if the

76
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,559
deployments deviate from the extenders I

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,319
have also built some runtime monitoring

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,750
systems for traditional and IOT systems

79
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,880
and finally I have developed defense

80
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,060
mechanisms for both cellular networks

81
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,829
and IOT systems so my research all of my

82
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,160
research is grounded on developing

83
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,190
techniques for formal verification from

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,630
using formal education program analysis

85
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,470
software testing and applied

86
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,239
cryptography so today's talk

87
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,070
I'll mainly I will be mainly

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,650
focusing on the adversarial testing

89
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,010
framework that we have used for

90
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,989
analyzing 4G and v g7 inter protocols

91
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,120
then I will talk about a like three

92
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,170
noble side channel attacks that we have

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,850
identified through a dedicated

94
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,070
probabilistic reasoning technique and

95
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,920
finally I will talk about a software

96
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,690
fuzzing technique for for verifying the

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,458
implementation when the binary

98
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,030
instrumentation is hard and code

99
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,660
coverage information is missing so as

100
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,910
you know that

101
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,799
sailu network in our national critical

102
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,350
infrastructure it is widely being used

103
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,459
not only for personal communication but

104
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,560
also it enables

105
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,470
connectivity for billions of IP devices

106
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,739
which further enables critical services

107
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,269
such as smart series connected vehicles

108
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,820
telemedicine also critical services like

109
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,669
smart grid electricity distribution it

110
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,010
is also used for broadcasting public

111
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,530
safety messages for instance we have

112
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,990
seen that in 2018 a ballistic missile

113
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,859
alert was sent in Hawaii though the

114
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,810
message was sent in

115
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,889
secondly but it created a huge chaos

116
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,840
among the people so so critical

117
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,270
vulnerabilities in such infrastructures

118
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,679
can be exploited by the adversaries to

119
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,810
perform different security and privacy

120
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,889
level attacks including broadcasting

121
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,740
such fake emergency alert messages so as

122
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,300
you can see that it is crucial to

123
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,000
analyze the technical designs and

124
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,340
deployments so that these technical

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,949
problems and critical vulnerabilities in

126
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,169
the technical designs not even chicle

127
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,360
down to the opponents so like for in

128
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,639
case of 5g it is better to analyze these

129
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,419
5g technical designs before it gets

130
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,520
deployed at a massive scale by 2020 so

131
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,229
before going to the details of my work

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,109
let's first see what are the existing

133
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,110
threats identified by the previous work

134
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,699
so one of the notorious issues in 40 and

135
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,599
5g cellular networks is the identity

136
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:28,219
catching networks so my identity is the

137
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:31,580
the identity I mean that a unique

138
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:33,319
identity of a cellular device we call it

139
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,800
IMSI or international mobile subscriber

140
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,110
Aniki identity and once it is the closed

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,240
disclosed in plain text the adversary

142
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,710
can use that and perform

143
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,690
man-in-the-middle attack or can

144
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,698
eavesdrop your conversation and even

145
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,129
that even after that it can track your

146
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,129
location so later on researchers have

147
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,229
shown that even these imz is kept secret

148
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,569
but also can be replaced by the

149
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,770
temporary identifier called TMSI or

150
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,719
temporary mobile search for identity

151
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,789
still the adversary can track your

152
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:04,279
location some other researchers have

153
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,250
shown that lack of authentication for

154
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,909
the data plain messages you can perform

155
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,430
like DNS redirection attacks so all of

156
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:16,520
these previous work they have either

157
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,779
used clever intuitions but most of them

158
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,938
has at least one of these following

159
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,979
limitations first either they do not

160
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,650
have any systematic approach for

161
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,659
analyzing the protocol or sometimes they

162
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,460
have some systematic approach but they

163
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,979
do not have any adversarial assumptions

164
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,560
and these approaches are mainly geared

165
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,839
towards analyzing the performance and

166
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,759
reliability and some other work they are

167
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,860
specifically focused on very like

168
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,589
analyzing the previous generations in an

169
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,450
ad hoc manner so in this work we try to

170
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,520
address this fault falling

171
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,280
like whether we can systematically

172
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,840
verify the design of 4G and 5g network

173
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,489
protocols with respect to proposed

174
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,080
security and privacy guarantees so for

175
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,910
analyzing any Network protocols or

176
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,669
systems the first challenge is the lack

177
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,610
of formal specification so as we have

178
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,110
seen that RFC's or technical designs of

179
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,270
cellular networks they're written in

180
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,850
natural languages which actually induce

181
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,560
like under specification

182
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,640
misinterpretation or ambiguities the

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,200
second challenge is the protocol

184
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,390
complexity as you know that Scylla

185
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,130
network protocols are stateful also

186
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,320
there are multiple participants and

187
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,010
market multiple sub procedures which are

188
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,590
intertwined which makes the analysis

189
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,630
scalability challenges and another

190
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,460
challenge is the obtaining the formal

191
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,260
requirements like what are the security

192
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,659
and privacy goals that the system wants

193
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,000
to ensure so there is no formal list of

194
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,580
our compiled version of these

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,290
requirements another challenge is that

196
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,810
all these network protocols and systems

197
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,230
are closed source so we cannot use any

198
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,330
white box approaches and final challenge

199
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,300
is the legal barrier like these network

200
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,690
operators they purchase the license

201
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,760
spectrum and they operate on these like

202
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,460
license spectrum so if we have to test

203
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,140
these networks we cannot actually send

204
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,359
these packets in this license spectrum

205
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,820
and it is not allowed not even in u.s.

206
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,830
but from other part of the countries so

207
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,830
as they proceed I will show how we have

208
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,840
addressed all of these challenges so

209
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,789
before going into videos let's see

210
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,169
like what is the cellular device and

211
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,960
what is the cellular network

212
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,700
architecture so in cellular context a

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
device is called the user equipment or

214
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,650
UE each device has a unique identity

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,559
called IMEI or International Mobile

216
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,940
Equipment Identity to get this to get

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,590
the cellular connectivity network

218
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,370
operator provides the SIM card which

219
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,350
stores the master security and a unique

220
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,150
identifier it is called as I said like

221
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,550
IMSI international mobile subscriber

222
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,030
identity which is 440 and the

223
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,099
counterpart for 5g SD su P or

224
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:52,699
subscription permanent identifier so

225
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,920
though the ims ir su p this this

226
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,020
identifier can be exposed in plaintext

227
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,269
but master secret key will never be

228
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,540
exposed in plaintext

229
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:04,490
now let's see in the context of cellular

230
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,680
network a geographical area is divided

231
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,410
into hexagonal cells where each cell is

232
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,930
served by a base station multiple such

233
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,540
adjacent cells consist of a radiation

234
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,910
area so the base section works as an

235
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,099
intermediary between the device and the

236
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,050
co networks the core network has

237
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,990
multiple components or multiple nodes

238
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,380
but for this talk like I'll be focusing

239
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,959
mainly on AM F or application mobility

240
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,540
management function for 5g which manages

241
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,310
the registration D registration and

242
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,560
paging procedures it means that the

243
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,709
connection establishment this connection

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:45,229
and the mobility management so for for

245
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:47,599
analyzing the the technical design one

246
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,560
of the key techniques is the model

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,259
checking so let me show how it works so

248
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,138
the high-level idea is to check the

249
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,829
model of a system against some

250
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,630
properties it could be secure and

251
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:02,029
privacy properties that whether the

252
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:05,029
model works perfectly fine with the

253
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:07,069
given against the given properties so by

254
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,490
model I mean that the regular behavior

255
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:12,380
system behavior of the system

256
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,240
represented abstractly with some kind of

257
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,189
graph representation or finally the

258
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,279
state machines so the model checker

259
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:20,509
takes these abstract model or the graph

260
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,660
representation of the system and

261
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:25,880
properties and checks whether there is

262
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,519
any path in the graph that the property

263
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,500
gets violated if not we are good but if

264
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,120
there is any path where the property

265
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,490
gets violated then the model checker

266
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,110
provides a counter example so it means

267
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,569
the sequence of the steps that an

268
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:43,430
attacker can take to perform some kind

269
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:45,349
of attacks so for our analysis we

270
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,410
consider a dollar via a style attacker

271
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,730
model so let's see how it what is this

272
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,540
kind of model like dollar V our data

273
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,540
model so for for the internal

274
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,209
communication between the layers of the

275
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,569
device we considered the channel the

276
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:04,550
internal communication is private also

277
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:06,139
the communication between the base

278
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,760
station and the corridor it is

279
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,699
considered private because it doesn't

280
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,750
use any 5g or 4G network it is it

281
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,990
happens through

282
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,790
like secret tunnel so the communication

283
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,190
channel between the device and the base

284
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,870
station it is we consider public

285
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,040
communication gel that means it can be

286
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,660
influenced by the adversary so let's see

287
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
now there see what are the adversarial

288
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,219
capabilities in this context so

289
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,260
adversary six man in the middle middle

290
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,630
between the similar device and the base

291
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,550
station and Co network so the adversary

292
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,460
actually is treated as a environment

293
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,969
variable that means the model checker or

294
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,460
the D system consider a as a environment

295
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,650
random in the room variable it chooses

296
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,380
whether the it is an adversarial town or

297
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,560
not so if it is an adversarial town the

298
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,720
adversary can drop the message it can

299
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,660
also modify the type and content of the

300
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
message also adversary can act as an

301
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,490
impersonator for the regiment

302
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,770
participant but note that according to

303
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,200
this doll area adversary model the

304
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,680
adversary cannot encrypt or decrypt the

305
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,110
messages if it doesn't know the key so

306
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,170
the key inside of our analysis is that

307
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,870
while like the properties that we want

308
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,310
to verify for for 4G and 5g server

309
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,150
systems they have some common

310
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,219
characteristics

311
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,199
what are they first in the temporal

312
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,760
ordering of events so let me give you an

313
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,680
example let's say you are a part of

314
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,830
employer a party student and you want to

315
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,449
access the party resources like machine

316
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,089
part of machine first you have to

317
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,100
authenticate yourself and then you can

318
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,260
access the machine so the authentication

319
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,270
comes first before you access the

320
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,390
resources so this is called temporal

321
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,920
ordering of events second characteristic

322
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,439
is the cryptographic constructs which

323
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,400
means that secrecy authenticity

324
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,690
observation equivalence this kind of

325
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,000
properties that will be under check and

326
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,100
another property is the linear integer

327
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,960
arithmetic for instance the sequence

328
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,630
number which is used to prevent replay

329
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,430
are acts like sick SQL and it has a

330
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,630
specific checks so the intuition is that

331
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,439
the model check out the general-purpose

332
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,150
model checker

333
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,920
they are good at reasoning the temporal

334
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,959
trace properties and linear integer at

335
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,990
meta properties whereas the

336
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,830
cryptographic protocol very per can

337
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,930
efficiently argue about the

338
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,780
cryptographic constructs now the

339
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,660
question is how can we leverage the

340
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,130
capabilities of these two different

341
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,530
protocol very fair so I will show you

342
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,530
how we can actually combine them in our

343
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,390
system so here is the high-level idea of

344
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,430
the five queries on a framework from the

345
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,460
technical designs of 4G and five general

346
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,800
protocols we built the abstract model of

347
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,290
the cellular device base station and the

348
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,180
core network and combining them we call

349
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:51,589
it abstract cellular protocol model then

350
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,020
with the abstract seller protocol model

351
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,090
we combine what we incorporate the

352
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,880
adversarial trips so that we can reason

353
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,060
about the adversarial actions and we

354
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,130
call it threat instrumented model these

355
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,469
model is are then given to the model

356
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,930
checker now model checker needs another

357
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,450
input that is the properties but there

358
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,219
is no formal list of properties given by

359
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,340
the specifications or the technical

360
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,620
design documents so for this we resort

361
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,400
to confirm instead suites provided

362
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,350
provided by the standard body so

363
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,480
conformance test which means that there

364
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,040
is a set of unit test cases and those

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,770
that are related to security and privacy

366
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,030
we translate them into like desires

367
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:37,310
property also we infer or extract the

368
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,630
informal properties from the technical

369
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,910
specifications and technical

370
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,650
requirements takuan documentation then

371
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,260
we feed all these properties to the

372
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,810
model checker one by one so model

373
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,670
checker if the market finds that there

374
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,939
is no violation of while checking a

375
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,010
property then we are good so there is no

376
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,020
such contra example there is no problem

377
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,240
in the system but if there is a problem

378
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,970
in the system then we'll get a counter

379
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,800
example and then we take this counter

380
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,730
example to the keep the perfect Porter

381
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,979
or very fair to rule out some of the

382
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,160
like the spurious contra examples like

383
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,960
in the initial model we have we have an

384
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,579
assumption that we replace all the

385
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,220
cryptographic related messages with

386
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,510
their plain text counterparts so because

387
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,930
of this abstraction there might be

388
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,220
serious example so we if the

389
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,010
cryptographic protocol very fair

390
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,650
adjudicates that the all the attack

391
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,230
steps are valid then the attack is

392
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,260
doable in real life but if there is is

393
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,139
not any any kind of experienced attacker

394
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,999
steps then at we

395
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,189
we use that the result from the keep the

396
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:45,920
perfect protocol very fair and at that

397
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:48,079
as an invariant to the desired property

398
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,709
so that that attacker steps will not be

399
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:55,128
a spurious attacker steps will not be

400
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:56,709
further in like introduced in our model

401
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,970
checking part

402
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,549
so with this adversarial testing

403
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,549
framework we have identified eleven new

404
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:06,858
attacks for the 5g networks five of five

405
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,569
also five inherited attacks we have

406
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:12,079
identified which have been inherited

407
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:14,479
from the 4G networks a previous version

408
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,449
of our of our framework we call it 4G

409
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,669
LTE inspector that identified ten new

410
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:22,459
attacks for the 4G networks and nine

411
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,859
paradise and implications of these

412
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:28,419
attacks are ranging from over Wheeling

413
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:31,869
location tracking I'm the TMZ exposure

414
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:36,529
artificial chaos and service profiling

415
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:38,540
so as I promised like like the adversary

416
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,639
can exploit the vulnerabilities of the

417
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,410
cylinder protocols and send fake

418
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:50,509
emergency alert message let me show you

419
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:52,759
a demo for this one so here with these

420
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,519
software defined radio peripheral I have

421
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,369
set up a fake base station which will

422
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,429
try to send a fake emergency alert

423
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:03,230
message to my device as you can see that

424
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:06,529
device is already connected to 4G LTE

425
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,269
now I have I have just started my fake

426
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:13,099
base station and it will try to send

427
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:15,349
this fake message as you can see that

428
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,829
this emergency warning so this is the

429
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:20,198
message I have set not so much scary but

430
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,730
as you can see that this message

431
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,289
probably you can you have you can

432
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,149
receive this kind of emergency alert

433
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,950
messages and you should not believe this

434
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:33,260
message at all but this can create like

435
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,090
if the message is scary it can create a

436
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,850
huge panic and all the people like like

437
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,850
we have seen in in the case of Hawaii

438
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,860
so all of these findings we have

439
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,049
responsibility disclosed these findings

440
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,389
to the cellular sender body we call it

441
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,570
GSM a and they have acknowledged our

442
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:59,360
findings and a number of changes will be

443
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,740
coming in the next release 16 for the

444
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,070
different layers and the security

445
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,620
architectural specifications also Intel

446
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,700
has used our tool internally and they

447
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,649
have identified a couple of

448
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,070
vulnerabilities and quantum also has

449
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:15,049
shown interest to use our tool also it

450
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:19,370
has got wide coverage from the mass

451
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:21,049
media and technical outlets so as we as

452
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,239
you have seen that while analyzing the

453
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,039
protocol we have used some kind of

454
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,470
high-level protocol abstractions like

455
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,269
high level we have designed our model

456
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,909
the high level protocol flow of the

457
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,419
system but there is a kind of trade-off

458
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:37,820
between the fine-grained modeling and

459
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:40,279
the competence of the test like you may

460
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,250
have false positive or false negative if

461
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:46,070
you have very high level view of the

462
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,429
protocol but as you model the protocol

463
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,908
in a more fine granular way you might

464
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,250
have more states as you have more States

465
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,830
or more complete view of the system you

466
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,210
might be able to find more critical

467
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,439
vulnerabilities such as side channel

468
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:05,600
problems but the problem is that the

469
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,570
model checker will export whenever you

470
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,449
give such kind of huge or complete model

471
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,289
of the system because it will like fall

472
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,379
into a state space expression problem so

473
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:22,370
in this like next work I will show that

474
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:24,649
how we can like identify side channel

475
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,809
vulnerabilities in a particular sub

476
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:29,379
procedure of cellular system using a

477
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,610
specific probably sequencing technique

478
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:33,529
so let me first give you a high-level

479
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,908
overview that how paging positive works

480
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:40,129
for the for 4G and 5e networks so as as

481
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,809
as you know that whenever you have to

482
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:43,639
get a cellular connectivity you will

483
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,250
have a SIM card for your device and that

484
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:47,090
same card has a unique identity

485
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,960
IMSI or international mobile subscriber

486
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:54,139
identity but to protect the illegitimate

487
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,549
exposure of such critical identity the

488
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,340
standard body

489
00:19:55,549 --> 00:20:00,350
that whenever the device connects with

490
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,789
the network after this authentication

491
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,519
and connection establishment procedure

492
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,090
the network assigns a temper identity

493
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,360
called

494
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,970
TMSI to the device and it is shared

495
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,408
secretly so that no one is able to

496
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,940
extract that okay now now you're

497
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,100
connected your phone is connected to the

498
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,629
core network and you might have cellular

499
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,969
activity like incoming and outgoing

500
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:26,480
messages so you remain connected but

501
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,999
after a while your phone will be will go

502
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,909
to the idle State if you don't have any

503
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:33,619
silver active activity so if you if your

504
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,450
mobile phone or several devices in the

505
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:37,549
idle State and if you have some kind of

506
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,009
incoming services like phone calls or

507
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,289
SMS then how the core network or the

508
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:43,820
network will let you know that there is

509
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:46,789
some kind of incoming services for you

510
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,739
the core network sends a paging request

511
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:51,109
message to the base station to which

512
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,929
your device was last seen connected and

513
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,960
then the base station broadcast the

514
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:59,600
paging message to all is cellular

515
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,779
subscribers in its cell

516
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,330
note that this paging message does not

517
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,970
have any kind of encryption and does not

518
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,549
have any authentication so receiving

519
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,190
this paging message the device checks

520
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,720
the records in the paging message and

521
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,720
each of the recording the paging message

522
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,489
is a tuple that consists of the Tempur

523
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,499
identifier of the device and the

524
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:24,169
indication of the service type if it is

525
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:26,149
PS or packets which it will have the

526
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,429
service will happen through 4G network

527
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:30,289
if it is a CS or sake switch this our

528
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,960
service will happen through circuit

529
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,970
switch networks and receive while

530
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,340
checking these lists of records

531
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,149
sequentially when the device will hit is

532
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:44,869
own imz or TMZ the device will connect

533
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:49,279
back to the core network now let's see

534
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:51,289
in this idle state how the device will

535
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,629
receive the speeding message or

536
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:56,230
notification of incoming services so

537
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:58,519
during this idle time the device

538
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:02,450
majority of the time the device nips and

539
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,340
it periodically wakes up so if a message

540
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,279
or paging message or not if this

541
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,260
notification comes during the sleep time

542
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,240
the device will not be able to get

543
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,120
that message but if it comes in the

544
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,640
monitoring phase the device will able to

545
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,100
receive and respond to that message the

546
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,930
the time at which the device wakes up

547
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,260
periodically we call it paging ovation

548
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:26,150
or faking frame index so without loss of

549
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,970
generality let's assume that the time

550
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:33,080
domain of 1450 networks it is divided

551
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:36,830
into 128 system frames where each frame

552
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,230
is of a length of 10 millisecond now the

553
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,629
question is that which device will wake

554
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,820
up at which system FEM how it is decided

555
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,340
basically it is decided based on your

556
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,340
last seven bits of the AIIMS of your

557
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:52,100
different device if two devices have

558
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,360
same eye same last seven bits then they

559
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,330
will wake up at the same time ah so can

560
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,120
you see any any problem or canny issue

561
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,449
of this design apparently it may appear

562
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:09,580
that this is a very good design in terms

563
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,580
of energy optimization and performance

564
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,010
okay so okay let me show that like what

565
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,830
could be what could go wrong so the the

566
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,560
problem is that the IMG of your device

567
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,800
is fixed for the entire lifetime of your

568
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,970
SIM card that means the paging location

569
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:36,409
of your device is fixed right so knowing

570
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,960
the phone number if I give phone power

571
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,400
to your number so first thing will

572
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,680
happen is that there will be a paging

573
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,570
message generated by the base station of

574
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,490
your device so let me show like what

575
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,280
could go wrong if I just know your phone

576
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,950
number whether the attacker can identify

577
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,240
your paging occasion and if the attacker

578
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,510
can identify your paging official

579
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,300
whether they can track your location so

580
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,590
for this we have developed a a side

581
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,230
channel attack called tracking ver

582
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,949
paging message distribution the first at

583
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,310
the first step

584
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,640
the attacker passively like observes the

585
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:16,310
paging message distribution for all

586
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,020
21:28 system frames this paging message

587
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,149
this efficient shows that there are

588
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,830
different paging messages for different

589
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:26,950
silver subscribers in yourself

590
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,199
now knowing the phone number of the

591
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,409
victim the attacker makes a number of

592
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,139
phone calls the high level idea of this

593
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:37,149
attack is that how can we skew this

594
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:39,849
paging distribution so after making

595
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:42,748
let's say n number of phone calls that

596
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:45,519
after after that you'll find there is a

597
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:47,289
particular system frame where there's a

598
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,109
significant number of paging message

599
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:51,908
arrivals than rest of the others as you

600
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:55,749
can see that if that is the case that

601
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:58,269
means that system frame is the paging

602
00:24:55,749 --> 00:25:00,249
occasion for the victim if you can like

603
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:02,139
impart that that means the victim was

604
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:05,289
present in that cell area also it

605
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:09,908
exposed some last 7 bits of the victims

606
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:12,249
IMSA so now the question is how many

607
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,169
phone calls are required by the attacker

608
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:16,269
to perform this like attacker

609
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:19,659
identify your business of a target area

610
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:21,580
and your paging location for this we

611
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:24,700
developed a likely whose likelihood

612
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,499
based analysis where we exploit these

613
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,659
informations as you can see a paging

614
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:31,539
message may contain 16 paging records

615
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:34,299
for 16 up to 16 cellular devices where

616
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:35,859
there could be pickings like package to

617
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,969
each indication of service or sockets

618
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:41,710
which indication of service another like

619
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:43,960
the timing function we exploit is that

620
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,849
after making a phone call the

621
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,489
probability of receiving a paging

622
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:50,649
message between time interval T 1 and 3

623
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:54,429
3 is significantly higher than the time

624
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:56,859
interval at T 4 also we export the base

625
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,259
rate of the package to it and services

626
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,658
records while we have we captured this

627
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,669
paging distribution so utilizing all

628
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:06,940
these information we compute the

629
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:10,269
likelihood Li that that the IV victim's

630
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,070
PFI I it means out of 1.5 iframe is the

631
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,849
victim speed rating fame index our

632
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,979
paging location

633
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:16,960
you also compute the likelihood when

634
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:20,409
victim is not present in that particular

635
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,269
target area so the adversary then

636
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,149
identifies the victim spending occasion

637
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:27,159
when likelihood of AI is significantly

638
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:30,969
higher than the rest of for the rest of

639
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:34,929
the other system frames and using these

640
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,920
analysis technique the adversary can

641
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,960
require up to

642
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,810
three to seven phone calls to identify

643
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,400
became speeding occasion as you can see

644
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:46,419
that Beijing operation also expose

645
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:51,850
victims IMSI like you can use that for

646
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:54,460
tracking the victim so now when we

647
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:58,149
reported these vulnerability to the

648
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,360
cellular standard body in 2018 they

649
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:04,420
actually tried to fix this problem very

650
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,219
quickly so this they have used like

651
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,590
Beijing they have decided that paging

652
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,480
location should be decided based on the

653
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,370
temperature identifier of the device

654
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,640
instead of the unique identifier like

655
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:18,219
IMSI which is permanent but the solution

656
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,280
they proposed at that time like in 2018

657
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,160
we were kind of skeptical like this

658
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,320
solution might be broken in future is

659
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,990
some with something like another attacks

660
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,210
like this is a classic example which

661
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,880
shows that if you do like fix your

662
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,130
solution without rigorous evaluation

663
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,540
Security evolution things may go wrong

664
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,060
in another time

665
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,430
so with our 5g reason our framework into

666
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,370
that is publishing 2019 we have shown

667
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,860
that these like solution or fix can be

668
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:53,939
broken and still the adversary can get

669
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:57,760
your TMZ and identify your location so

670
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,440
now another funny story that the

671
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,720
motivation of this the second problem

672
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,240
comes from the another interesting a

673
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,690
story like in 2018 when we had a chance

674
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,100
to go to welcome to like help them like

675
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,220
recreating some of the attacks that we

676
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:15,520
have identified for using our 4G LTE

677
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,980
inspector framework one of the guy from

678
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,300
the 3gpp actually they challenged us

679
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:25,360
that 5g networks does not expose your

680
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,570
unique identifier IMG in plain text they

681
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,850
use public key encryption to make it

682
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,000
secret so their challenges whether we

683
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:36,250
can break it so from that actually we we

684
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,740
have like motive I would have get

685
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,770
motivated to wait to see like whether

686
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,960
the imz can be broken for the of the for

687
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,270
the party networks so exploiting this

688
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,150
detour protect reporter vulnerabilities

689
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,720
like we can see that the imz which is

690
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,659
represented

691
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,090
as a 15 degrees binary this decimal

692
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:59,259
correct number it is represented as a 60

693
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,230
bit like 40 49 bit binary numbers so out

694
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:07,059
of these 49 bits the first six digits

695
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:09,370
are first 18 bits of your imz can be

696
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:13,389
easily identified with a service called

697
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:16,719
h lr lookup service which this first 66

698
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:18,279
degrees of your IMSI or first 18 bits

699
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,190
basically says that which network

700
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:23,649
operators and which country your SIM

701
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,600
card belongs so in this case as you can

702
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:28,959
see 3 1 0 is the mobile country code

703
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,259
which is for USA and 2 6 0 which is the

704
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,750
network code for t-mobile and using the

705
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:38,740
topper Eric we know the last 7 bits of

706
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:41,049
the IMSA so out of 49 bits the adversary

707
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,720
knows 25 bills that means adversary has

708
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:46,360
to crack like I didn't like has to find

709
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,129
this the rest of the 24 bits so this is

710
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,850
kind of a guessing attacks so for this

711
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:53,980
guessing we need to builder or a call so

712
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,539
we exploited the registration procedure

713
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,970
or the connection establishment

714
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:00,250
procedure for the 5g networks to build

715
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,919
this Oracle the high-level idea is that

716
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:06,179
the attacker will guess and imz and

717
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:09,159
check whether that gaze imz is valid and

718
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:12,340
if the imz is valid then whether it

719
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:15,669
belongs to the victim now let's see how

720
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,100
it works so the adversary setup sets up

721
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:20,289
a man-in-the-middle relay between the

722
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,509
victim and the core network and

723
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,669
legitimate base station so man in the

724
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:27,159
mirror man in the middle relay or MIT

725
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:28,419
emily consists of two components one is

726
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,870
the fake base station and they take

727
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:33,190
cellular device now the fake solar

728
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,949
device of the beast man in the middle

729
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,269
relay sends a registration request

730
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,269
message our connection establishment

731
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:43,450
request message and it guesses the imz

732
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:47,769
and encrypt with the public key of the

733
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:49,720
core network now if that guest imz does

734
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:52,929
not belong to the any subscriber of the

735
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,659
of that network the network will send a

736
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,610
very station request reject message so

737
00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:00,129
from that it can identify that the guest

738
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,830
IMG is not kind of valid or not for yet

739
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:03,600
for the victim now the attacker tries

740
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,720
with an

741
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,389
they're guests imz and this time if it

742
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,549
receives an authentication challenge it

743
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,700
relays that message to the target or

744
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:16,049
victim now the adversary wants to see

745
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,630
whether the victim can solve that

746
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,100
challenge or not if the victim cannot

747
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,710
solve the challenge that means this

748
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,969
authentication challenge is not for him

749
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,780
but if the victim can solve the

750
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:30,000
challenge now the guest imz she belongs

751
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,580
to the target or victim so this is how

752
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,240
we actually cracked the rest of the 24

753
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:41,129
bits of the IMG for the victim so we

754
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,919
have like these kind of side channel

755
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,020
attacks like torpedo also enable another

756
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,880
side channel attacks for the 4G network

757
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,980
for retrieving the IMG of the user

758
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,510
device as previous work we reported this

759
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,929
vulnerability and GSMA has acknowledged

760
00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:01,289
the findings they have proposed this

761
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:03,480
defense which didn't work letter and we

762
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:06,419
have identified that using our 5gd is

763
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,450
another framework also this work has got

764
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:11,580
like a similar kind of mass media at an

765
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:17,039
attention from the technical like

766
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,539
outlets so as we have used these formal

767
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,750
analysis frameworks and probabilistic

768
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,658
using techniques like the the most of

769
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,159
the attacks that we have identified

770
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,470
actually they are active attacks set up

771
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,200
by the fake base stations let's see how

772
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,390
it works so when the cellular device

773
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,900
first wants to connect to the core

774
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,179
network

775
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,010
they're like searches or scans the

776
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,799
nearby areas for the presence of the

777
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,539
base station to whom it can connect also

778
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,879
based on at the same time periodically

779
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,679
broadcast it messages like the system

780
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,539
information block messages and must

781
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,760
there are different types of broadcast

782
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,830
messages that are sent in plaintext and

783
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,320
they do not have any identification

784
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:57,658
sorry authentication so this lack of

785
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,200
authentication and lack of encryption

786
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:03,600
can be exploited by the adversary to set

787
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,880
up a fake base station so fake position

788
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,879
mimics or impersonates as a legitimate

789
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,890
base station and emits these similar

790
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,200
kind of messages since it doesn't have

791
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:17,280
any authentication it not it not it will

792
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,929
not be identified so the idea is that

793
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,510
lack of authentication and encryption

794
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,669
also the message the broadcast message

795
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,460
is sent with higher signal strength

796
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,780
so naturally the device will lose

797
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,580
connectivity from the legitimate

798
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,908
position and will connect to the paper

799
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,129
station now the fake position will

800
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:38,669
request for your ion see this happens

801
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:41,640
for 4G networks and in 4G networks the

802
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:43,860
device will respond with imz like it

803
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,970
provides imz and sending in plain text

804
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,399
but in 5g as I have said like 5g is kind

805
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,909
of more secure than 4G it tries to

806
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,679
encrypt that message like I am Z with

807
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:57,890
the public key of the core network that

808
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,030
is that means the adversary can now

809
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:05,150
cannot see this IMG of the VPN device

810
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,350
but still the adversary can perform like

811
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,090
different kind of denial service attacks

812
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,918
for example authentication reject or

813
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,929
widget message or registration reject

814
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,658
message which caused the device to go

815
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,030
into the kind of Nam state it until you

816
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,960
restart your phone you'll not be able to

817
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,820
connect it to the core network so so as

818
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,440
you can see that lack of authentication

819
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,659
is the root cause of for the most of the

820
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,490
active attacks performed by the fake

821
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,820
base stations so how can we solve this

822
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,709
problem so basically this three way

823
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,389
standard body considered the possibility

824
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,190
of using public infrastructure based

825
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,720
solution to solve this issue as

826
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,970
impractical due to some technical

827
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,089
challenges but but this is the first

828
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,638
part we will show that that public

829
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:49,259
infrastructure can be still realizable

830
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,570
by solving the technical and

831
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,310
non-technical challenges so let me show

832
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:57,089
you that the high level idea of this

833
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:59,460
solution so the core network has assumed

834
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:03,119
that this home sub server which stores

835
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,920
the certificate which is like the self

836
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,869
signed and the core network with

837
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,660
assigned the home server in the core

838
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,640
network will assign certificate to the

839
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,920
mme or MF that is the mobility

840
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,810
management function or the entity in the

841
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,760
core network and it is signed by the

842
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:21,060
corner the certificate of the MMU design

843
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,720
with the core network the the corner the

844
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,330
mme and MF or dns will assign the

845
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,319
certificate for the base station and

846
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,759
then when the base station will

847
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,940
broadcast these messages

848
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,670
it will include

849
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,950
all these certificate chains and add the

850
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,630
signature of these messages so when the

851
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,460
cellular device we've received that

852
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,130
message like if they receive the fake

853
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,410
messages from the base station you will

854
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:48,220
be able to identify the legitimate ones

855
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:50,049
and the paid ones so this is the

856
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,118
high-level idea but they are starting

857
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,160
this and apparently this solution is

858
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,819
pretty straightforward but what are the

859
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,920
technical challenges the first technical

860
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,779
challenge is the certificate chain

861
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,869
length as you can see there are number

862
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,690
of intermediate nodes this article chain

863
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:10,180
will be long the second challenge is the

864
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,660
how can we incorporate the certificate

865
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,328
revocation and finally the signature

866
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,799
generation for the messages if the

867
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:20,609
signature signature generation takes too

868
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,800
much time then there will be like

869
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:26,440
problems of scheduling these periodic

870
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,589
messages that are broadcast by the base

871
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,530
stations also the signature generation

872
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:36,310
if it takes too much extra bytes then

873
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,780
it's another problem so for addressing

874
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,009
these challenges we proposed an

875
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,040
optimized PKS

876
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:44,079
scheme in which we have introduced

877
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,390
different levels of optimization first

878
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,130
is the PKI level optimization in which

879
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,060
we propose a lightweight design of this

880
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,660
our debate for the cellular network

881
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,810
which reduces all these unnecessary

882
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,020
fields introduced by the traditional

883
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:00,880
x.509 based certificate second is the

884
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,579
protocol level optimization in which we

885
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,920
minimize the number of transmissions of

886
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,680
this high length or long length

887
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,060
certificate and finally we introduced

888
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,060
cryptographic scheme level optimizations

889
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:15,700
in which we try to reduce the size of

890
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,500
the signature by aggregating multiple

891
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,669
signatures to an offline online based

892
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,380
signature generation schemes now the

893
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,599
non-technical challenge is the roaming

894
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,940
let's say you have a SIM card from the

895
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,710
team while now you go to Europe and you

896
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,410
are getting connectivity convert from

897
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,020
Vodafone so how the base station will

898
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,940
get certificate from the chemo wise Co

899
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,390
Network so it's kind of a roaming

900
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,730
challenge and like the it can be

901
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,920
probably can be solved by some kind of

902
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,480
mutual authentication or community

903
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,600
between the two network operators

904
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,980
supported by the like the like to

905
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,600
different region but essentially we have

906
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,910
shown in the paper that with the

907
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,140
introduction of the e seam or electronic

908
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:04,600
SIM card these roaming can be solved so

909
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,839
this work actually are also got high

910
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,060
visibility visibility from the technical

911
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,620
mass media and we had a chance to talk

912
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,799
to the talk to the FCC Federal

913
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:17,799
Communication Council and they were

914
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,480
pushing for this solution whether it can

915
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,530
be incorporated for the next generation

916
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,500
cellular networks so now as as we have

917
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:30,400
seen that we can use these and a formal

918
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,840
verification framework or to analyze

919
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,710
these forty and five G seven other

920
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,540
protocols to identify the possible

921
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,390
problems and fix before it gets deployed

922
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,980
also we have shown some kind of defense

923
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,920
mechanisms against the fake decision

924
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,930
attacks but it's still if you secure

925
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,670
these cellular connectivity between your

926
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,310
are the cellular modem or baseband

927
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,870
processor of your smart phone and base

928
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,670
station and the core network there is

929
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,859
another processor in your smart phone

930
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,960
that is running on the all the general

931
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,490
purpose applications like text messaging

932
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,790
like audio video all kind of

933
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,770
applications and these application

934
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,600
processor communicates with the basement

935
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,030
processor with one of the interface

936
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,520
called 80 interface through 80 commands

937
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,890
so let's say your phone app wants to

938
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,170
make a phone call and let's say you dial

939
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,879
some number and that comment goes to the

940
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,500
application processor then application

941
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,680
processes are translated with these

942
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:27,790
comments with the 80 commands and then

943
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,339
they call happen interestingly we have

944
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:34,150
found that - smart phones are connected

945
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:37,270
to peripherals like USB or bluetooth it

946
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,400
allows or accepts 80 commands so what

947
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,160
can go wrong so if there is any

948
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,460
malicious peripheral like USB or

949
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,080
malicious blooper FL even like the as

950
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,490
you know that Bluetooth connections are

951
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
inherently vulnerable to

952
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,720
man-in-the-middle attack the adversary

953
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,150
can inject valid or invalid data

954
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,060
comments though a previous work has

955
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,540
shown that the misuse and abuse of value

956
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,420
Atacama

957
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,759
since 18 turf face is a critical entry

958
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,340
point for the baseband processor invalid

959
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,950
data commands can cause catastrophic

960
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,620
problems such as private information and

961
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:13,899
disclosures so in this work will show

962
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,240
that how we can systematically analyze

963
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,760
the correctness and robustness of the

964
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,529
baseband related 80 commands execution

965
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,690
process for the modern smartphones so

966
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,910
there are certain challenges for such

967
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,430
systemic analysis one may assume that we

968
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:33,279
can use static analysis or dynamic

969
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,100
analysis but the problem is that most of

970
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,070
the farmers for these cellular devices

971
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,230
are not available even they are

972
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:44,980
available there are some kind of vendor

973
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,750
specific of partition which like makes

974
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:51,100
these static analyzers and dynamic

975
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:53,560
analysis fail also we have like try to

976
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:57,490
use binary instrumentation which is an

977
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,170
useful like first step for fuzzing like

978
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,959
like well-known fuzzing techniques such

979
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,550
as AFL but it also fails because of

980
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,560
these previous two problems like

981
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,870
obfuscation and unavailability of the

982
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,080
format so we address all these

983
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:13,540
challenges with our new grammar based

984
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:19,660
evolutionary fuzzing framework let me

985
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:23,560
show how it works so first we take a set

986
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,480
of like eighty grammars which define how

987
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,880
the 80 command should should be given

988
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,370
and we feed that to the evolution in the

989
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,000
evolution module which systematically

990
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,950
changes the the brahmers

991
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,920
like wheezing mutation and crossover

992
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:41,230
techniques to find the set of invalid

993
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,740
data grammars note that this invalid 80

994
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:48,850
gamma is a class of invalid 80 command

995
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:53,799
instances so after this mutation and

996
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:56,680
crossover we feed that like we feed that

997
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,500
grammar or like invalid grammar to the

998
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,690
evaluation module so the evolution

999
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,900
module generate the concrete instance of

1000
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:07,480
this grammar and inject to the device

1001
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,060
under test with 80 common injector the

1002
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,460
80 command after the execution of each

1003
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,890
of these 80 command the phone response

1004
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:20,619
with the okay or error response

1005
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:22,629
so from this execution we precisely take

1006
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:25,000
the timing information of D of the

1007
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,650
eighty command execution and we use

1008
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,630
these timing information as a loose

1009
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,119
indicator of the code coverage if it

1010
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,099
takes higher time then we assume that we

1011
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,560
are we can infer that it actually

1012
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,869
explore more more number of basic blocks

1013
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,660
of the of the device

1014
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:43,359
so using these timing information and

1015
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,520
another is the detection of the

1016
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,140
deceptions that means after execution of

1017
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,869
an eighty command it may happen that

1018
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:53,589
your cellular activity goes completely

1019
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:55,450
off so using this information we compute

1020
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:59,589
the score for each of these ethical

1021
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:02,439
dreaming grammar and feed our return

1022
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:05,170
this score to the evolution module the

1023
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,760
best scored grammars are selected for

1024
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:09,900
the parents for the next round which

1025
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,580
goes to again the mutation and crossover

1026
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,619
session and at the end of this session

1027
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,960
we'll get the new proposition for the

1028
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:18,880
subsequent rounds now the interesting

1029
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,700
thing about these 80 father is that

1030
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,089
after end of these fuzzing process we'll

1031
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:28,419
get a set of 80 grammars instead of

1032
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:32,040
concrete ad common instances and each of

1033
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:35,230
these 80 grammar represents s set of

1034
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,900
invalid instance of concrete 80 command

1035
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:39,940
that means like if you have a problem in

1036
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,790
one of the instances the other instance

1037
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:46,210
that will have the same like problems or

1038
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:52,509
same effect for the execution of this

1039
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:54,910
data command so so with this framework

1040
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,680
we have identified like four invalid

1041
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,899
data grammars for the Bluetooth

1042
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,080
interface and eleven invalid data

1043
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:04,359
grammars for the USB and let me show you

1044
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:07,359
one of the attacks are that we have

1045
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:09,460
identified to our framework so assume

1046
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,250
that your phone is not connected to any

1047
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:16,150
USB peripherals or Bluetooth peripherals

1048
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:18,720
now as soon as you are connected to your

1049
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:21,010
headphones or your carplay of your car

1050
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,810
the adversary can exploit the

1051
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,280
vulnerabilities of these Bluetooth

1052
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,900
connection and inject invalid data

1053
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:34,750
commands so

1054
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:36,400
let me show you domain for this one so

1055
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,490
your phone is connected to the 4G LTE

1056
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,850
service now from the Bluetooth

1057
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:47,819
peripheral will send a invalid data

1058
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:50,110
command like this is the 80 plus CI mi

1059
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,440
semicolon ABCD which is an invalid

1060
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:58,390
command and using this English command

1061
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,280
I'll get the IMSI of the phone that is

1062
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,330
connected to the blue tube itself so

1063
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,060
once this IMSI is exposed then as shown

1064
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:09,009
in the my previous word but it can be

1065
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:16,090
useful for man in the middle attack or

1066
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:17,590
checking your location so we reported

1067
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,180
all these vulnerabilities to the

1068
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,180
affected vendors like Samsung and Google

1069
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,520
and they have blocked the USB and

1070
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,339
Bluetooth modern interface for dat

1071
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:31,870
common execution also they have assigned

1072
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:33,880
like CVS and like like previous worse we

1073
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:39,299
also got coverage from the mass media

1074
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:41,680
outlets so internal stock I have mainly

1075
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,560
focused on these three words also I

1076
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,790
touched on slightly the the defense

1077
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,710
mechanisms against the fake base

1078
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:53,620
stations so like taking into account all

1079
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:56,530
my like previous work and my kind of

1080
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,839
vision for my future work I would like

1081
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,390
to first see like whether we can develop

1082
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,970
like a scalable and uniform verification

1083
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,660
framework for the entire five G cellular

1084
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,600
ecosystems

1085
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,089
let me show I mean what we have solved

1086
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,700
and what are the remaining and what are

1087
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,740
the challenges for this one so as you

1088
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,589
can see the from the this protocol stack

1089
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,470
like we for now as of now we have

1090
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:22,750
analyzed only two layers of the cellular

1091
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:25,390
protocol stack for the for the cellular

1092
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,070
device which enable can TVT between the

1093
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,620
several device and the core network

1094
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,180
through the base station there are of

1095
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,580
course there are other layers and

1096
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,799
vulnerabilities in other layers may have

1097
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:39,578
critical like problem security and

1098
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:42,459
privacy problems also like in 5g you

1099
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:44,289
have connectivity of different access

1100
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:47,788
technologies like you can actually

1101
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:51,160
access to the core network through Wi-Fi

1102
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:53,410
also whenever you make a phone call like

1103
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,118
from t-mobile to AT&T the t-mobile and

1104
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,160
AT&T they have to communicate with each

1105
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,459
other so there could be some

1106
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:03,489
vulnerabilities in such inter or poskim

1107
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:06,879
cross network communication also 5g will

1108
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:08,829
enable network sizing and it may have

1109
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,599
problem that unauthenticated excess of

1110
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:15,670
network size of any services so taking

1111
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,900
all this into account i would like to

1112
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,219
first like set up or develop a uniform

1113
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,829
verification or a scaleable the

1114
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:26,769
diffusion framework which analyzed the

1115
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:29,799
technical design of the 5g cellular

1116
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:31,799
ecosystems as a first step i would like

1117
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:35,410
to see like whether it is possible to

1118
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:37,180
automatically extract the formal model

1119
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:41,440
from the natural language specification

1120
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,399
and i can also use this former model to

1121
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,619
check who that there is any

1122
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:50,160
inconsistency in the formal spec so the

1123
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:54,009
the another challenge that we have that

1124
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:57,640
how can i scale my previous approaches

1125
00:47:54,009 --> 00:48:00,219
for analyzing this entire system so we

1126
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,308
can use our leverage decompositional

1127
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:05,619
verification in which we can divide the

1128
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:08,619
whole ecosystem into a smaller component

1129
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:11,079
and analyzing isolation and then finally

1130
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:15,549
combine them using a zoom current ESL

1131
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:18,249
reasoning I would also like to like

1132
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:20,410
build verification framework for the

1133
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:23,410
deployments and implementations but but

1134
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,118
the challenge is that the defined state

1135
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,098
machine or the model for the cellular

1136
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,289
device or the core networks are unknown

1137
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:32,619
then how can we actually solve this

1138
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:36,969
challenge for making making it useful

1139
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:40,569
for our analyzes so we may use bakbox

1140
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:41,769
techniques like fuzzing to like extract

1141
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:44,739
these finite state machines

1142
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:47,439
automatically from the device and the

1143
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:50,469
network or network components and like

1144
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,660
we can infer this like as a hypothesis

1145
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,500
or infer the finite state machine what

1146
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:58,270
this

1147
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:01,599
bag box systems and like as I have shown

1148
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:04,030
that our earlier analysis only uses like

1149
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,579
property guided analysis or reasoning

1150
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,380
techniques I would like to also see how

1151
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:10,089
can how we can actually combine these

1152
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:14,619
property guided analyzes with

1153
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:16,420
differential testing and after all these

1154
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:19,780
analysis would like of course we'd like

1155
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,000
to like do the root cause analysis and

1156
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,089
develop the deep differences for the

1157
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,930
problems that we'll be identifying so as

1158
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:30,849
for instance we have probably all of us

1159
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:35,529
have experienced these kind of spam

1160
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:38,410
calls like by the robo calls so there is

1161
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,660
no such straightforward solution so far

1162
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,819
we have seen so the one of the main

1163
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,098
problems for these spam calls is the

1164
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:47,529
lack of in planed authentication let's

1165
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:49,930
see that what is the current status so

1166
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,180
the authentication happens between your

1167
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:55,680
phone and the co network but let's say

1168
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,970
your colleagues from another network so

1169
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,129
then there is an authentication or

1170
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:02,919
communication between the like two

1171
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,970
network operators and authentication

1172
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,550
which authentication between the

1173
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:09,220
colleague and that particular like the

1174
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,470
phone at verse so there to make sure

1175
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,810
that there is no spam calls or robo

1176
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,939
calls we have to like propose some

1177
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,740
defense which ensures into and

1178
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:21,760
authentication between the caller and

1179
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:26,109
callee and finally I would like to like

1180
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,240
see whether we can like generate the

1181
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:33,880
reference implementation from the formal

1182
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,709
spec so as you know that 5g will enable

1183
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,160
many different digital services

1184
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:41,200
so as of my future work I'd like to like

1185
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,660
also analyze the security and privacy of

1186
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,509
those critical services such as smart

1187
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,629
smart grid electricity distributions

1188
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:51,310
telemedicine and connected vehicles so

1189
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,020
another challenge will be coming for

1190
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:55,990
this for the next generation seller

1191
00:50:53,020 --> 00:51:01,599
networks such as 6g which will enable

1192
00:50:55,990 --> 00:51:03,430
like terabytes of data per second as we

1193
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,579
have seen that 5g networks enables like

1194
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,240
gigahertz like speed but it comes with

1195
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:10,990
gosta

1196
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:13,509
privacy introduced by the smaller cells

1197
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:15,330
like we don't know what will happen like

1198
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:19,210
when we it will enable like terabytes

1199
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:20,980
like communication systems and like we'd

1200
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,350
like to see like whether our approach

1201
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,600
can be scaled for the next generation

1202
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:29,110
cellular networks also I would like to

1203
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,730
continue my like work towards the safety

1204
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:33,040
security and privacy of IOT and

1205
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,390
cyber-physical systems but there are

1206
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,450
many different challenges because of

1207
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:39,790
heterogeneous early devices of different

1208
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:41,980
capabilities for instance that the

1209
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,009
devices for the smart home systems and

1210
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,350
like industrial IOT and they have

1211
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,450
different forms of connectivity like as

1212
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:51,750
you can see that some devices may get

1213
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,730
connected with first decoded cord inter

1214
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:57,430
then it may get connected with the phone

1215
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,630
which then eventually gets connected to

1216
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,419
the core networks so there are multiple

1217
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:04,480
hops but some other devices may get

1218
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:07,270
connected to the Wi-Fi or access point

1219
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,360
of your home and sometimes we have seen

1220
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:12,009
that the coroner works as an like Wi-Fi

1221
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,460
access point which directly connects to

1222
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:18,160
the like the cloud like bypassing the my

1223
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,619
phones and some others like Internet of

1224
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:24,609
Things devices gets directly connected

1225
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:27,340
to the core network using LTE or WLAN so

1226
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:29,740
all taking into account all these kind

1227
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,840
of future engineers things like first I

1228
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,209
would like to see or analyze the

1229
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,090
individual components like for example

1230
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:40,030
that something could go wrong in the IOT

1231
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:42,660
devices like IOT farmers or time or a

1232
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:45,940
specific form or transport protocols and

1233
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:48,420
finally I would like to see like whether

1234
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,820
I can analyze this whole IOT ecosystem

1235
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:55,600
like like holistically that I have shown

1236
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:58,450
for the 5g networks so as a concluding

1237
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,640
remark I have shown that how my research

1238
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,160
leverages formal verification software

1239
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,560
testing program analysis and applied to

1240
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,440
purify to systematically analyze the

1241
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,119
designer paper brands and can build high

1242
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,030
assurance defenses

1243
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:14,380
I have mainly talked about our work 5g

1244
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,930
reasoner the adversarial testing

1245
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,280
framework then have shown the side

1246
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:20,850
channel problems using probabilistic

1247
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,910
reasoning technique and the

1248
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:26,480
fuzzing framework for for verifying the

1249
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:28,859
implementations of a smartphone and

1250
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,280
finally I have also shown that how can

1251
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:34,350
we scale our current approaches and

1252
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,360
adapt it for the 5gn next generation

1253
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,250
seller networks and iota systems with

1254
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:46,200
that I conclude my talk and I'll be

1255
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:51,060
happy to take any questions any

1256
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:54,080
questions ok well thank you very much

1257
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,080
said we appreciate it

1258
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,730
you
