1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,229
alright let's get started so welcome

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,090
it's my pleasure to introduce miss

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,240
Morgan princey

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,099
she's a solution engineer at the census

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,520
focused on identifying trends and

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,460
tracking tracking threat groups and

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,070
vulnerabilities using census data her

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,320
career in cyber security began in botnet

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,400
detection where she worked to protect

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,920
websites api's and mobile apps from both

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,649
by detecting anomalies in web traffic

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,010
and interrogating user identification

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,320
system morgan holds a Bachelor of Arts

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,070
in economics urban studies from

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,590
University of Michigan Morgan is a 20-19

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,260
world IT Award winner for women in

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,020

will be recorded thank you it's so nice

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,750
to be here wonderful introduction going

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
to talk a little bit just about some of

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,500
those security risks that we can

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,170
identify using internet wide scan data

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,970
and if you do have questions again you

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,170
can click the button and stop me at any

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:29,220
time we'll leave a little time at the

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:31,650
end as well ok so a little background

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,470
you know touched on it earlier with Dave

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,049
said but I live in the city of Detroit a

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,360
lot of my history has been in this space

32
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,009
or on pot detection I spent about five

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,250
years doing that at the web application

34
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,770
level while doing bat detection I was a

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,770
security analyst so just really digging

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,548
into a lot of web blog traffic trying to

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,500
isolate what is or is not a bot request

38
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,020
I worked for a lot of airline clients a

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,310
lot of classified listing clients that

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,250
were just getting scraped a lot or even

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,299
financial institutions who were subject

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,068
to credential stuffing attacks also like

43
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,050
most of my head space at that time was

44
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,458
around the web application layer but

45
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,890
then I joined a company called census

46
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,140
and that was founded by the

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,000
founders of zmapp which came out at the

48
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,859
University of Michigan will talk a

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,400
little bit about that but since joining

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,840
them a lot of my thinking processes been

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,490
around security problems that we can

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,280
sell there that can be solved at the

53
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,810
network layer and that's where you know

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,340
all the skimming happens okay so we can

55
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,190
talk about internet-wide scanning has

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,400
anybody here you showed in or census or

57
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,780
zoom I in the past okay good a handful

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,700
of people awesome

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,110
has anyone by chance deployed their own

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,359
instance of zmapp oh okay great you're

61
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,550
so you know wonderful probably a little

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,590
bit of a painful process but basically

63
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,660
what internet-wide scanning is is we are

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,760
scanning you know all of the ipv4

65
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,680
internet space and we collect that data

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,179
and we have a search engine you know

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,940
mostly commies have search engine on top

68
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,470
of it allowing researchers you know or

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,010
companies to use it for a variety of

70
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,900
different purposes so a quick history of

71
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,340
internet wide scanning you know in the

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,829
2000s really around 2002 researchers

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,110
realized hey Google's indexing a bunch

74
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,459
of these web pages and because what

75
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,380
they're indexing these web pages we can

76
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,290
start to search for security keywords

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,769
not just you know sims cheat codes or

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,989
something else that was popular in 2002

79
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,170
and as a result you could say hey I'm

80
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,190
searching for admin login portal and

81
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,450
what's going to show up is a bunch of

82
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,700
sites that might have had me log in

83
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,399
power all exposed so that kind of

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,048
started to popularize the idea of I can

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,390
look for security problems outside of my

86
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,650
own website and look more broadly at

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,420
kind of Internet as a whole 2004 shadows

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,459
server was founded by a group of

89
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,649
volunteers and they are kind of looking

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,269
to again enhance the overall security of

91
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,970
the Internet by popularizing internet

92
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,230
wide data and security instances they're

93
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,680
happening across a bunch of different

94
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,200
sites then in around 2009 comes a

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,010
company called show Dan they are great

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,440
they really kind of popularized a lot of

97
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,978
the IOT devices that are exposed on the

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,680
Internet

99
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,440
so popular you know it's like hey guess

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,210
what there's traffic lights that are

101
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,460
exposed to internet there's medical

102
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,479
devices that have x-rays on them exposed

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,969
to the Internet

104
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,199
and so big publishers like Forbes CNN it

105
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,789
kind of became in the spotlight as

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,969
people were saying oh my gosh we don't

107
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:40,169
know what is out there and then in 2012

108
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,710
zmapp was started at the University of

109
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,889
Michigan

110
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,859
so zmapp was developed by secured room

111
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,180
rich and really what that did is it took

112
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,129
scanning and Internet which some people

113
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,810
had been able to do but he was able to

114
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,900
do it in 45 minutes with this new

115
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,129
technology which is uber fast right it

116
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,830
allowed you to do that

117
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,349
and get that data available make them

118
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,609
much more available along with being

119
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,800
able to have most up-to-date and fresh

120
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:09,750
information and so zmapp turned into

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,189
census the founders join that team 2013

122
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,539
we see a few other companies projects

123
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:16,740
sonar zoom I fo a you know some Chinese

124
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,710
players that are coming into the space

125
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,509
as well and then around 2017 we've got

126
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,068
green noise coming in so gray noise is a

127
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,180
little bit different basically what

128
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,349
they're doing is saying hey we've got

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,889
these skinning companies that are

130
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,180
popular we need to make sure that

131
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,589
there's no spoofer in this space right

132
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,199
if you're allowing your website to be

133
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,789
hit by scanners you don't want somebody

134
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,159
that's like maliciously spoofing it and

135
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:42,229
so they do a good job of kind of phasing

136
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,229
out that nuance it's like a gen 2 almost

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,029
okay so what makes that special like why

138
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:53,729
is internet scanning as a whole

139
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:55,259
important really it's because it's it's

140
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,750
a pretty difficult problem to solve if

141
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,300
anyone's used and map in the past and

142
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,089
map is awesome but it's really difficult

143
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,740
to keep state you know it just doesn't

144
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,110
scale well and keeping state is very

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,750
challenging if you're using classic

146
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,729
method like connect the scans don't

147
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,259
really scale either right you're asking

148
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,020
the kernel to keep mini connections open

149
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,699
and that can get quite messy the other

150
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,400
thing is if you are trying to linearly

151
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,289
scan the internet you know just go to 0

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,599
dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 to 0 that's 0 dot 0

153
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,430
dot 2 you're going to get blocked very

154
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,199
quickly you're gonna run across the

155
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,370
company that has you know a net block in

156
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,779
that space and they're you're gonna say

157
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,199
what are you doing here you know and

158
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,310
that data becomes inconsistent and so

159
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,389
there's a lot of challenges that happen

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,649
and that's why it's wonderful we've got

161
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,100
a few different companies in the space

162
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,900
that can

163
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,820
provide that data and kind of push the

164
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,880
boundaries of what is able to be done so

165
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,990
that people can use it easily so that's

166
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,659
a little background on internet wide

167
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,950
skinny and today we'll talk about you

168
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,860
know some applications if using that

169
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,479
data a lot of this is available with

170
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,530
free accounts so if you you know haven't

171
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,370
don't have been caught on showdown or

172
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,719
census I encourage you to use it there's

173
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,540
a lot of cool stuff out there but we'll

174
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,220
talk about specifically threat hunting

175
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,010
vulnerability trends and using internal

176
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,010
scan data to understand attack surfaces

177
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,600
okay so threat hunting this is the face

178
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,659
that's in like most embraced I would say

179
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,840
by internet wide are they most embraced

180
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,550
internet wide scan data it's helpful

181
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,080
just being able to search for different

182
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,140
threat actors and monitor their behavior

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,400
over time as they you know tracking

184
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,260
their moves is something that

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,210
governments and different corporations

186
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,360
are honestly dedicating entire teams to

187
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,750
do so it's a bit of a Where's Waldo I

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,480
would say but in this instance Waldo or

189
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,050
I guess this is Walda is a bit of a

190
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,090
shapeshifter

191
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,010
who's moving you know through a rapidly

192
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,280
changing internet so it becomes a really

193
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:57,320
a much more complicated problem it's not

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,669
the 80s with Where's Waldo books anymore

195
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,880
but if you're looking to how do you

196
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,550
start with threat hunting generally you

197
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,620
know internet wide scan data is massive

198
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,430
if you're looking for the entire ipv4

199
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,170
space just contextually that's about

200
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,960
seven point four terabytes worth of data

201
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,850
so you really need a game plan of like

202
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,840
what are you looking for what are the

203
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,310
things that will help you identify

204
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,349
different threat groups that you might

205
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,120
be tracking and so generally how people

206
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,730
do this is they look for IO C's or

207
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,770
indicators of compromise that you can

208
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,380
cue off and start to like find those

209
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,699
different attack groups for Waldo those

210
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,309
io C's would be you know the striped

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,200
shirt glasses pom hat a little smile on

212
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,228
his face so that's kind of what you're

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,510
trying to look for when you're looking

214
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,950
for a threat groups you know this is one

215
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,500
of the easiest ways we'll talk kind of

216
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:50,580
about looking for an IOC of just the

217
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,260
phrase hacked by so some groups are you

218
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,720
know will advertise themselves and say

219
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,730
hey if we hack into your inner your webs

220
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,410
we're going to take over the title of

221
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,820
the page and say we're hacked by this

222
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,189
group and they kind of have this

223
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,140
publicity stunt it's almost like the

224
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,970
tagging of the cyber world and it's

225
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,970
pretty pretty fun to track I enjoy it

226
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,890
and you know this happens all the time

227
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,780
if you've been reading the news recently

228
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,740
you probably saw that this happened a

229
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,470
few weeks ago to when the US government

230
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,390
sites was hacked by a group that

231
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,580
self-identified as the Iran cyber

232
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,319
security group hackers and so you can

233
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,660
see right in the page title there's the

234
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,010
phrase hacked by and this is something

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,230
that we grab in parsing our internet

236
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,930
scans so it is easy as saying hey I want

237
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:38,840
to search for this phrase and voila we

238
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:44,819
get some details on it so we can do that

239
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:49,290
if we pull this up here maybe alright

240
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,960
cool so this is the sense this search

241
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,110
interface you can see here I just put in

242
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,200
we're gonna look in port 84 you know in

243
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,200
this HTTP protocol and we're gonna do a

244
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,080
quick regex here for just hacked by or

245
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,180
port 443 a similar thing looking for

246
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,370
that again phrase hacked by and you can

247
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,890
see right now we're getting 82 results

248
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,510
and you know there's a variety different

249
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,830
things this is both has you know

250
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,970
database exposed we've got a variety of

251
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,140
instances where this you know this

252
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,380
particular group looks like they've

253
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,390
recently done some activity and so all

254
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,010
this data is within the past seven days

255
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,530
you know things that were live on the

256
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,740
internet at least in the past seven days

257
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,819
maybe sooner so you can start to dig

258
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,100
into this and you know when you're on

259
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,170
here as well if you click this open you

260
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,140
can get a bunch of data about what was

261
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:45,589
happening on the server at that time so

262
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,730
it's pretty fun well let's get back to a

263
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:50,990
second here and see if I can figure out

264
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,990
how to get back to the presentation

265
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,579
yeah cool

266
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,829
and I should also say that this is

267
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,140
something that you can do with an API as

268
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,910
well so both should and scientists know

269
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,280
most of these major internet scanning

270
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,770
companies have an API that allow you to

271
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,319
do very similar searches and you know

272
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,890
pull that data down into different

273
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,630
formats if you're looking for that so a

274
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,150
little bit of research that we've done

275
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,590
on this you know this was later in

276
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,610
December we were looking at some of

277
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:36,080
those groups and you know who is who's

278
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,140
that group that's like announcing

279
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,030
themselves as as hacked by from like an

280
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,760
anthropological standpoint I find this

281
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,990
to be quite interesting there's groups

282
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,480
like telling us a little bit about

283
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,610
themselves there's all sorts of naming

284
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,020
conventions for these groups oftentimes

285
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,400
if you actually go to the websites which

286
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,050
I wouldn't recommend unless you're doing

287
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
that in a sandbox

288
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,390
there's generally a bunch of like a see

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,550
art and things of that nature too so you

290
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,500
know there's a bunch of artifacts around

291
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,709
who these groups are and what they're

292
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,700
trying to accomplish you can see here

293
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,520
there are some groups that are just

294
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,000
announcing hey we attacked you by this

295
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,510
CV and you probably should fix this you

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,430
know this has been around since 2016 by

297
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,800
the way that is the dirty cow exploit

298
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,069
which was you know in a issue that

299
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,609
impacted the Linux kernel but you know

300
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,700
there's also groups here this led us to

301
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,470
Tim it's pretty interesting we see him

302
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,540
like working alongside someone and

303
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,610
almost all of his attacks so it's like

304
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,770
hacked by him as well as somebody else

305
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,930
maybe you know almost like a co hacker

306
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,670
in a way so there's a lot of different

307
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,829
things that can you know be tracked in

308
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,680
terms of what's going on more socially

309
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,750
with these different groups also say

310
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,040
like one of my colleagues uses this and

311
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,320
he does a cool program where he will

312
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,170
pipe these IPS into aqua tone and then

313
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,810
do a flyover screenshot tool to be able

314
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,729
to say what are the actual screenshots

315
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,459
of the websites look like and then uses

316
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,780
that with some image processing so cool

317
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,500
things that you can start to do and

318
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,660
that's you know some of the more basic

319
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,030
ones but you can also start to track

320
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,670
those who maybe don't want to be found

321
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,459
and those get a little bit more

322
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:25,039
complicated I would say

323
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:27,098
that's really my and so to track some of

324
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,779
these groups that don't want to be found

325
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:31,039
generally like I will go to a lot of

326
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,759
groups that are doing this

327
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,019
professionally

328
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,979
go to mitre and they attack attack

329
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,209
framework and they'll look for some of

330
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:41,239
those big weight wigs that the

331
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:42,949
government's are tracking and so this is

332
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,999
just a list from Leiter in terms of some

333
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,978
of their groups that they're following

334
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:48,289
they generally have a bunch of IOC s on

335
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:49,309
the site and they also have software and

336
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,348
things like that that they are most

337
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:54,039
commonly associated with different

338
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:57,919
malware samples things of that nature

339
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:01,249
there's a lot of them so let's say we

340
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:04,239
wanted to track dry decks so actually

341
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:06,739
Drydocks us prosecutors just recently

342
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:09,409
have brought down and brought charges

343
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:12,829
against somebody behind the dried wrecks

344
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:14,869
command and control operator this was a

345
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:18,019
form of malware that was specializing in

346
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:20,229
stealing bank credentials vias macros

347
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,569
that would go through Microsoft Word and

348
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:26,209
as they actually are prosecuting for

349
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:28,098
them they accused this man I've also

350
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,289
kind of being behind a group called evil

351
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:31,699
Corp and in general they are you know

352
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:36,859
saying that it's been a hundred million

353
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:39,409
in stolen revenue since 2015 so if we

354
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:40,639
want to start tracking dry decks you

355
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:42,829
know we need to start searching for some

356
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,949
different IOC s and so what you can look

357
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:48,589
for is bad SSL as a tool that will start

358
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,449
to give different SSL certificates and

359
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,199
you can actually filter some of these by

360
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:55,429
different attack groups okay so dry

361
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,988
decks so we've got a bunch of different

362
00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:00,199
as I sell surged so we can see that

363
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:03,529
these are a little bit old 2018 but

364
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:09,228
we've got a sha-1 listing here so I

365
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:11,199
grabbed these and put them into Google

366
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:13,609
bigquery which is a way that we actually

367
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,399
all of census data goes into Google

368
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:18,289
bigquery that we can start to query this

369
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,019
but because we've got a long list of

370
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:23,899
them I'll put it in here and say hey we

371
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,759
want to understand what are some of the

372
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,449
certificate attributes that these

373
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,009
attackers are using so when census scans

374
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,540
the internet and when a lot of these

375
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,710
grouping are scanning you also do

376
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,660
she lost handshakes to grab a

377
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,850
certificate and so we've got a bunch of

378
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,610
this data I'm going back to about 2015

379
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,560
now so when I run this I'm gonna start

380
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,300
to pull some of this data around the

381
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,130
issue or the subject some of the

382
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,719
validity links things of that nature and

383
00:15:46,130 --> 00:16:00,530
we can see what we find let that run for

384
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:03,470
a moment and also kind of contextualize

385
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,990
this that I did check and none of these

386
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,400
certificates are currently live so these

387
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,800
were ones that had previously been

388
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,480
associated with that group if it was as

389
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,579
easy as if they're live on a host we

390
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,650
could start to profile that host and say

391
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,570
what are attributes about this host can

392
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,030
we find related hosts but because

393
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,950
they're not live we want to go through

394
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,110
and start to find okay can we find other

395
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,000
certificates that they might be using to

396
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,940
then go and see if those are live

397
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,280
anywhere all right so we've got a bunch

398
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,890
of data back and then generally what you

399
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,959
want to do or what we recommend here is

400
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,720
starting to see some commonalities and

401
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,090
can we find anything that stands out in

402
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,580
terms of maybe this is an attribute that

403
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,790
belongs to this this group in terms of

404
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,500
how they set up their configurations so

405
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,390
a few things looking at this we do see

406
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,960
on this subject Dan if you look kind of

407
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,120
and we scroll over and I'm noticing that

408
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,400
these start to match the subject Dan and

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,430
the issue or Dan are matching in all of

410
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,230
these in all of these certificates which

411
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,079
is fairly interesting right like maybe

412
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,240
that's something we can cue off of

413
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,899
another thing looking at this all of

414
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,550
these validity lengths seem to be

415
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,020
somewhat common right there we've see

416
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,639
all the same here just in that for a

417
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,410
scroll we've got 99 things to look

418
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,910
through but they look somewhat similar

419
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,860
here I've got some fingerprints and the

420
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,730
other thing is they all have one name on

421
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:32,350
the certificate so you know one name

422
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,350
might be also something we can look at

423
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,899
and so generally what we can start to do

424
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:43,890
is like a really basic attribution

425
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:45,959
analysis and this is a place where you

426
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,880
know I've worked with a lot of groups

427
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,559
that use census data and companies that

428
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
you know buy this data from us and

429
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,970
they're doing very rudimentary analysis

430
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,950
with some spreadsheets just to try to

431
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,200
see what's going on there's I think lots

432
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,510
of room for this to be more

433
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,370
statistically sound but one of this you

434
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,100
know this is a really basic example of

435
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,539
saying all right let's look at instances

436
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,639
where we see certificates where the

437
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,860
subject Deanna's issued the exact same

438
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,779
as the issuer Dion and inside of this

439
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,699
small test group of 100 certificates

440
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,529
that were associated with dry decks we

441
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,289
see a hundred percent of them have that

442
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:21,090
attribute now looking at all of the

443
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,700
certs that we see in census which is

444
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,789
every cert that was issued or was live

445
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,380
on a host since 2015 we see about 4.5

446
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,890
percent of those certificates have that

447
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,210
attribute the other things that we were

448
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,630
looking at was one name on a certificate

449
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,909
again a hundred percent of these these

450
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,620
test certificates had that case we've

451
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,450
got a much larger number though where

452
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,149
that's the case of all of the other

453
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,070
certificates the validity length seems

454
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:48,389
to be quite isolating though and then

455
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,340
when you aggregate all three of these

456
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,020
features together we start to see that

457
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,370
hey this is something that ninety nine

458
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,200
point six percent of all of the

459
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,610
certificates have but if you look at all

460
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,520
of the certificates we've reduced that

461
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,990
down to you know under one percent of

462
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,330
all the certificates for us to then

463
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:07,799
further look into and so what your

464
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,149
ultimate looking for when you're doing

465
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,220
threat hunting like this is you want

466
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:14,010
something that's both accurate and

467
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,720
precise right I would say that kind of

468
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,460
based on this analysis we start to get

469
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,110
something that's somewhat precise we're

470
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,860
able to say hey it looks like these

471
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,149
features are fairly unique to these

472
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,129
certificates that are associated at

473
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:27,899
Drive X we don't know yet if they're

474
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,370
accurate we don't know if that's when we

475
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,570
look at those if they're actually going

476
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,330
to correspond to that attacker

477
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,889
infrastructure or not to do that as hard

478
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,990
right now we need to look at those

479
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,789
certificates and look at the hosts and

480
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,710
we probably need to set up a honeypot to

481
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,390
see if we're seeing requests come in

482
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,309
from those hosts and see what kind of

483
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,720
behavior those hosts are exhibiting to

484
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,908
see if they would actually belong to

485
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,790
this attacker group but generally you

486
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,290
know companies

487
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,060
doing this or governments that are doing

488
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,800
this this is a little bit along the

489
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,440
lines of how they're using this data is

490
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,200
trying to find instances that we can

491
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,610
start to track and then say hey are the

492
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,990
things that we can find on the internet

493
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,340
that might actually belong to them and

494
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,470
what do we do if we find them any

495
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,790
questions on that

496
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:16,090
yeah behavior changes in those hosts

497
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,010
after the big data the big data

498
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,899
collection has been targeting those

499
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,620
specific key factors have you seen

500
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,680
changes in those factors over time so

501
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:29,860
you're asking if once somebody maybe has

502
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,490
been impacted by a threat group do we

503
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,800
see changes no I was wondering if the

504
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,630
threat group specifically changes their

505
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,970
methods in for example setting the

506
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,980
issuer and everything else as the same

507
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,810
or the lengths and everything like that

508
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,380
they do they've change it all the time

509
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,520
and so it is almost and that's it's a

510
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,050
frustrating game right like you're

511
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,940
waking up every morning and fighting the

512
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,770
same fight again where we see something

513
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,200
that's changed and then you have to

514
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,580
start cueing off of UI OCS and it can be

515
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
hard to find you know sometimes groups

516
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,310
just go completely dark and it's

517
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,350
probably because they've changed a bunch

518
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,629
of stuff and you have to start figuring

519
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,120
out okay what's next what are the next

520
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,550
little you know beacons that we can

521
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,739
understand from alienvault maybe or some

522
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,230
other types of Intel sources that are

523
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,300
telling you about these groups very

524
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,160
challenging and that's where maybe you

525
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,780
know it there's I think opportunity

526
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,610
machine learning at some point

527
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,410
potentially to start to be a little more

528
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,699
sophisticated with the modeling I would

529
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,230
say right now a lot of the customers we

530
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,770
see are doing aren't doing all of that

531
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,770
any other questions

532
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:48,919
oh can you click the mic button push

533
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,850
okay sorry

534
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:56,150
do you work you get information from the

535
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,270
block listing services or or do you work

536
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:04,010
with them around what sites are being

537
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:07,750
blacklisted any would I piece yes our

538
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,190
domain names like spam house oh yes so

539
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,890
us as a scanning company we don't get a

540
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,270
lot of that detail but as we are people

541
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,220
that are buying our data and using our

542
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,440
data oftentimes we'll use that

543
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,690
potentially as IOC right and so if there

544
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,010
are names that are coming in and have

545
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,530
been blacklisted because they've been

546
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,570
associated with phishing attempts or

547
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,120
have been associated with different

548
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,399
scams that is oftentimes something you

549
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,889
can start to queue off of and you can

550
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,960
find those both in the names on the

551
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,480
certificates is one way to link that

552
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,340
there's also certain times where if you

553
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,380
get an email come in and you're security

554
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,959
on the security team coming from that

555
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,820
domain you know you can start to find in

556
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,520
the IP associated with that domain and

557
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,710
then track that I that IP on census or

558
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:59,090
another scanning platform great question

559
00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:00,590
also when you see the you're thinking

560
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,389
about how this is going to be applied

561
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,760
and more automated in the future do you

562
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,799
see that coming from private or more

563
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,559
government at this point for tracking

564
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,190
these threats a little bit of both so

565
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,230
generally we see if you're a very large

566
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,000
company sometimes they will have threat

567
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,760
hunting teams and they find this to be

568
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,220
useful because they generally are like

569
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,289
hey it's a better investment for us to

570
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,679
have teams tracking this so that if we

571
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,240
start to have you know those handful of

572
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,890
certificates that we found there they

573
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,080
might start to say ok if we see in the

574
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,840
IP that has that certificate we're going

575
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,340
to isolate that request and do something

576
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,980
different before they can come into our

577
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,289
system so they have some incentive I

578
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,440
think from a hey we're protecting our

579
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,520
systems the government is doing that at

580
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,190
a much larger scale

581
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,900
as they are tracking even nation states

582
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,810
or you know some of those huge groups

583
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,340
and trying to do prosecution across them

584
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,470
so hard to say where that will come from

585
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,360
and maybe it is happening in some ways

586
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:04,630
too like some of what we have in terms

587
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,500
of visibility is is limited to alright

588
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,860
so now we can talk a little bit about

589
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,960
vulnerability trends this graphic I love

590
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,570
it so we recently subscribed like a fire

591
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,270
hose of CVEs that are coming in about

592
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,310
7.5 because we do some research around

593
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,560
that with our data and it is just

594
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,570
overwhelming the number of Seavey's that

595
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,700
come in and so we sympathize a lot with

596
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:30,610
and people in security spaces where you

597
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:34,220
just can be flooded with vulnerabilities

598
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:37,129
we'll talk about a few of them this was

599
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,040
one the exome vulnerability that came

600
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:43,670
out in about September or so and so XM

601
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:48,889
is a male Authenticator mail server and

602
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:51,920
this CVE was a 10 in the CBS s score and

603
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:54,770
allowed for unauthenticated route code

604
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,990
execution with root access to the email

605
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,800
server which are all very scary bad

606
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,090
words in the security world and you can

607
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,750
see here this is a little graphic by

608
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,280
project sonar and it's just like

609
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,410
overwhelmingly most of these went

610
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,550
unpatched and we're just almost all of

611
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:16,010
the versions were affected by this

612
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:17,960
so using internet wide scan data you can

613
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,320
start to see what are these trends and

614
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:26,300
different vulnerabilities that that are

615
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,790
released and so this is looking for this

616
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:33,230
exome it's everything that was version

617
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:34,790
four point nine two and below which at

618
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,620
the time that was the most up-to-date

619
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,700
version so it was a really a very large

620
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,800
CVE impact and so we're looking here at

621
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,210
you know a few different protocols we've

622
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,000
got one other one included in this

623
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:53,390
search yeah we're looking at four six

624
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,450
five and five 87 but you can see here

625
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,750
this is returning around two million

626
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,269
still IPS have XM running

627
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,500
you know are more than likely affected

628
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,789
by by this very severe CBE and so this

629
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,960
is something that you know tracking

630
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,389
these over time seeing some of the

631
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,820
adoption rates that patchi's has a lot

632
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:22,699
of you know interesting data that people

633
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:25,519
can be can be looking into and then

634
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,950
similarly this was one for a SharePoint

635
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,330
so this allowed people come to take like

636
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,309
complete control access of their

637
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,470
SharePoint servers which impacted a lot

638
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,360
of their microsoft products also quite

639
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,840
scary and you can see this when we did

640
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,279
some research about just over time what

641
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,129
some of the patch cycles were it's much

642
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,509
smaller in scale but it was you know it

643
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:48,789
just is hard to couch some of this stuff

644
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:51,409
and it's harder to see what um you know

645
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:53,269
what might need to be patched can be can

646
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:56,600
be challenging so we see that trend a

647
00:26:53,269 --> 00:27:02,539
little bit here and again if you click

648
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,158
on this sorry maybe not yeah well we can

649
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:10,879
even just do this right putting this

650
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:13,340
SharePoint here this allows you to do

651
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,678
just the random you know so strong text

652
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,408
search likely what we want this to be as

653
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,820
a specific version number but you can

654
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:21,440
see you know this takes in a lot of

655
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,779
different a lot of different versions

656
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,600
and allows you to see some of those

657
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:28,460
those trends over time so in terms of

658
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,250
security research this can be helpful

659
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,049
just to kind of get some contextualized

660
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:39,370
information about what is actually live

661
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:39,370
on on the internet right now all right

662
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,919
so one thing that you can do - and

663
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,870
generally when we're running these

664
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,120
searches around owner abilities a lot of

665
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,979
times people want to know okay cool

666
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,659
that's great to understand around

667
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,850
internet white trends but also what are

668
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,470
things that are I'm impacted and that's

669
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,080
a I think that's a big question and some

670
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,390
are aware the internet wide scan space

671
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,428
is kind of going is to say great you

672
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,230
have all this internet or all this data

673
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:13,130
about the internet show me everything

674
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,840
that impacts me and so that's very you

675
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,770
know it's a challenging problem to self

676
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,870
because now not only are you having to

677
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,820
reliably scan the internet but you also

678
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,860
have to start to attribute things to a

679
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,559
particular company or to an organization

680
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,320
and that becomes a question of like how

681
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,879
do we reliably say that we think this

682
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,100
host that belongs to you is really

683
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,450
similar in ways to this other host and

684
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,320
maybe that's something that indicates

685
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:44,409
ownership so on a basic level if we go

686
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:47,559
back to let's look back at this

687
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:50,750
vulnerability that we had up for Exim

688
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,809
cool so it's in some ways it's as easy

689
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,090
it's just you can add a thing if we want

690
00:28:53,809 --> 00:29:01,428
to say

691
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:03,289
Purdue so I haven't done the searches is

692
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:04,520
a little live demo but you can start to

693
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,470
just added during the main names of that

694
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,220
right and then you start to get a few

695
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:12,950
things back and that allows like a basic

696
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,799
very simple look into saying hey we can

697
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,630
find you know some things here that

698
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,090
allows more actionable insights around

699
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,070
those CVEs and say alright this is

700
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,530
something that now as an institution you

701
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,870
can take action on but there's other

702
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,090
things too right like if we go back and

703
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,729
you were trying to profile an entire

704
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,168
attack surface and that's like a phrase

705
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,760
that is just done meaning like what is

706
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,330
exposed to the internet and what is

707
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,830
something that you can start to you know

708
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,870
could be an impact of people getting

709
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,370
into your system you know there's lots

710
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:47,379
of ways you can do this and so if we

711
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,379
just go back and we say hey per dude edu

712
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,659
this is maybe the most rudimentary way

713
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,280
to do so we get 217 results

714
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,220
but we see over here that there's some a

715
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,180
s numbers that are also indicating per

716
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,040
day language that we can pretty

717
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,920
confidently say that's something that

718
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:11,090
would be only by this five for you so we

719
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:18,440
can say autonomous system let's get that

720
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:22,010
number ten so you can run some really

721
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,690
complex gnarly queries up in here it

722
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,160
does support regex

723
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:29,330
and you can do a lot of anding and Orion

724
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,470
so if you're playing around with us and

725
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,350
again you can you can create free

726
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:36,500
accounts and experiment don't be shy to

727
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,030
to add a bunch of stuff up here all

728
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,430
right so let's add these two ends and

729
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,960
see what we can you can fill out okay so

730
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,990
now we're getting in about four thousand

731
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,780
more assets the other thing you can look

732
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:52,700
into is starting to fill in this space

733
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:56,570
using certificate data so this

734
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,130
organization is equal to Purdue maybe

735
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,110
this is something we want to include as

736
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:05,390
a keyword and say show me everything

737
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:09,560
where we've got oh we call to Purdue

738
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:14,060
University come up okay we grew a little

739
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,550
bit there as well so now you know this

740
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,370
is this is fairly simple but you start

741
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:22,220
to see hey this is these are a bunch of

742
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,810
data about one institution and if you go

743
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,820
down the side here you know you can

744
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,200
start to see all we've got a bunch of

745
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,960
different protocols that are running

746
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,130
there might be things like printers if

747
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,570
there's you know all sorts of stuff that

748
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:36,380
can be exposed to the internet that

749
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,639
would be maybe surprising it maybe not

750
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,120
surprising depending on how much you

751
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,930
play around with Internet data but

752
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,870
there's a lot of things that you can

753
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,820
start to dig into and you know this is I

754
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,989
think again moving a little bit more

755
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,939
into some of these different

756
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,790
applications internet-wide scanning is a

757
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,840
fairly a fairly new concept there's lots

758
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,030
of different ways you can start to use

759
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,070
this but understanding hey what are the

760
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:01,960
things that I own and maybe I'm not

761
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:04,280
tracking explicitly is is one of those

762
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,530
one of those newer applications of the

763
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
data you can also start to say hey were

764
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,690
them what's them

765
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,990
I look like right we've got Purdue

766
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,740
infrastructure running all over the US

767
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,750
that's kind of fun

768
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:24,260
I can pull up some metadata reports as

769
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:26,840
well hey Morgan yeah what sorts of

770
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,000
things so what sorts of things would

771
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,939
these organizations be concerned about

772
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,620
like on I keep you kind of showed some

773
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,020
of the ports and protocols and stuff

774
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,270
like that but what would they define

775
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,330
concerning right and so let's look back

776
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:43,400
at the results of that generally you

777
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,220
know we you would expect fingers running

778
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,220
nine port 80 four four three forgotten

779
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,510
HTTP and HTTPS that's very expected most

780
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,790
people are not going to blink an eye at

781
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,550
that it's like hey these are web servers

782
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:59,300
that are running a lot of people in

783
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:01,520
order to admit idli all educational

784
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,669
institutions have a very colorful attack

785
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,000
surface I would say so but generally

786
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:10,550
things like if you got a telnet instance

787
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,260
exposed like that's pretty scary and a

788
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,570
lot of people don't wouldn't want that

789
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,570
and want that to be you know internal or

790
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,330
just taken offline in general if you've

791
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,830
got you know a database that's also

792
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,929
quite scary somebody can quickly

793
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,149
probably authenticate into that database

794
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:30,590
and then you've got a bunch of data that

795
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:33,740
could be PII exposed and that you know

796
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,139
could cause lots of implications some of

797
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,440
these like embedded devices or cameras

798
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,240
you know generally you don't want to

799
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,320
take any any risks with that kind of

800
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,640
stuff in terms of personal information

801
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,399
so a lot of times we would advise

802
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,540
companies say you know you have your own

803
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,160
rules you kind of have your own

804
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,320
understanding of what is okay within

805
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:59,030
your security posture but anything

806
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,510
outside of you know HTTP HTTPS you know

807
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,860
strongly secured SSH potentially all

808
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,450
that's doing the things you'd want to

809
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,469
start you know anything except those

810
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,460
would be some things you want to look

811
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:12,320
into and I guess one other thought on

812
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,929
that too is as company they're moving to

813
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,929
the cloud and both cloud and remote

814
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:20,630
workforces pose some other challenges to

815
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,790
you so cloud space if you are

816
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,770
putting assets into cloud there's

817
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,620
oftentimes a lack of visibility there of

818
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:30,860
what's going on and so that is another

819
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:33,710
