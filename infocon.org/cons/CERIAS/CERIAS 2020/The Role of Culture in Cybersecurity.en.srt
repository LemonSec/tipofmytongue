1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,629
all right so let's get started good

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,899
afternoon welcome to the weekly serious

3
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:16,540
security seminar series today it's my

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,779
great pleasure to welcome dr. char

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,460
sample from Idaho National Lab dr.

6
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,100
sample is the chief cybersecurity

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,640
research scientist for the cyber Corps

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,000
division at INL and she is a visiting

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,710
academic at the University of Warwick

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,530
Coventry United Kingdom and a guest

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,100
lecturer at Bournemouth University RPI

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,350
and Royal Holloway University dr. Sampo

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,559
has over 20 years of experience in the

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,260
information security industry and her

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,209
research focuses on deception the role

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,150
of cultural values in cyber security

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,159
events and more recently she has begun

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,519
researching the relationship between

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,860
human cognition and machines presently

20
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,949
dr. Sam Poe is continuing research on

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,619
modeling cyber behaviors by culture and

22
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:08,289
other areas of research our data

23
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:11,290
resilience cyber physical systems and

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:16,330
industrial control systems so let us

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,830
welcome cultural values in cyber

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,570
security and we're going to explore the

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,460
relationship this is a little different

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,889
pace than probably what you're used to

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,289
from some of the other talks we listen

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,870
to today I know that I've heard a bit

31
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,760
about nuclear cyber physical and whatnot

32
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,220
this kind of falls them to the threat

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,470
intelligence umbrella so we'll go

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,289
through basically the interests the

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,240
outline you know here of what why why

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,670
we're doing this background why this

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,800
research some of the studies that I have

38
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,870
already done some of the studies that

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,539
are ongoing and then open it up for

40
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,000
question and answer because that we do

41
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,979
have a kind of tight timeline and I tend

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,150
to run over feel free to interrupt me if

43
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,690
I say something that doesn't make any

44
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,040
sense introduction so you've I know we

45
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,810
hear this here I've been hearing it all

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,970
day here about the interdisciplinary

47
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,430
nature of cybersecurity because it does

48
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,859
touch all the different disciplines and

49
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,629
we keep hearing yes we need this

50
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,240
interdisciplinary approach but nobody

51
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:15,040
seems to be able to settle on what this

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,400
dis innit what this approach looks like

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,170
I have been suggesting that may

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,430
we need to not only think differently

55
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,609
but we need to learn these other

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,470
disciplines and incorporate from them

57
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,870
the models into our work so that when

58
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,489
we're talking to somebody about if we're

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,980
talking about cultural values we should

60
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,450
be able to speak like a sociologist who

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,939
happens to know cybersecurity not a

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,459
cybersecurity person trying to convince

63
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,659
the sociologist that we know what we're

64
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,159
talking about in they we they have

65
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,900
nothing important to say similarly with

66
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,000
psychology mathematics computer science

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,290
physics any of these other topics here

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,599
so this talk actually covers the results

69
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,519
of taking the interdisciplinary approach

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,950
to provide additional insights into

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
threat intelligence research so what I

72
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,700
did when I this was based on work that I

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,569
did for my dissertation that's where it

74
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,920
started and from there I went on and I

75
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,480
worked several years at the Army

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,548
Research Lab down in Adelphi Maryland

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,738
and got to do some more with it and I

78
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,709
got that was the basis for my fellowship

79
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,290
also so what I did was this let's take

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,459
sociology and what we know about data

81
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,659
science what we know about cyber

82
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,069
security and let's pull these three

83
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,948
together and see what we can come up

84
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,220
with study wise so there's a little

85
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:28,949
thought that there's going to be this

86
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,349
single internet culture that's supposed

87
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,060
to arise everybody's gonna fall fall

88
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,858
around the same technical issues and say

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,720
oh yes I see the world the way you do

90
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,590
and this is great we have one yeah

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,180
that's not happening that's that's not

92
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,079
never going to happen in fact why

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,120
because we think differently based on

94
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,430
where you grew up and what your values

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,400
are you will group data differently and

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,349
you will as a result because you group

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,519
the data differently you will come up

98
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,099
with attacks that we don't normally

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,829
anticipate so one of the things that I

100
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,970
always gets to me is we say I hear lots

101
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,530
of people say we're gonna have this

102
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,060
single culture and I'm like then why are

103
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,190
you surprised at the inventiveness of

104
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,479
our adversaries why are you shocked when

105
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,698
they come at you with something that you

106
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,440
hadn't thought about before if we all

107
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,199
are thinking the same you should have

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,298
thought about it so it doesn't happen

109
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,340
have you ever worked on an international

110
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,328
team so I look here and I look around

111
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,830
the room and I think we have an

112
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,690
international population in this room

113
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,010
and have you noticed that there are

114
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,080
different habits in different ways the

115
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,270
methods to get to the end result but we

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,979
sometimes we somehow find a way

117
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,389
to get to the right answer even if we

118
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,430
took different paths to get there and

119
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,630
that's kind of what we want to tap in on

120
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,940
because when we're talking about cyber

121
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,130
security and threat intelligence we're

122
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,780
not really interested in a single attack

123
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,819
although that gives us some insight

124
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,289
we're really interested in the attack

125
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,550
campaign so that we can get to the

126
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,409
various steps that they're taking along

127
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,699
the way in the campaign and figure out

128
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,590
how we can give the most effective

129
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,930
response and sometimes the most

130
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,818
effective response is not shutting them

131
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,289
down but rather frustrating them so

132
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,020
cultural values and biases are

133
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:07,389
unconsciously they unconsciously inform

134
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,370
many of our decisions so even when we

135
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,949
think that we are thinking something

136
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,930
through we're not really we just think

137
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,030
we're in control truth of the matter is

138
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,009
we're not because if you take if you

139
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,380
look at the since we're all I'm gonna

140
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,440
sue most of us or have a technical

141
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,669
background and prefer numbers towards so

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,569
when we talk about conscious and

143
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,210
unconscious thought you'll appreciate

144
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,889
this little piece of trivia if we're

145
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,138
concentrating on something consciously

146
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,979
we've processed that information at

147
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,509
forty to sixty bits per second okay but

148
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,340
our unconscious thought that's going on

149
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,810
all around well like like I'm talking

150
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,429
right now and you listen to me at forty

151
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,780
sixty bits per second but you're

152
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,009
noticing other things about me you

153
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,570
noticing other things about the room and

154
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,520
you're processing that at eleven million

155
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,340
bits per second so which one do you

156
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,159
think is going to have more say when you

157
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,289
make your decisions other interesting

158
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,900
thing about biases we can spot the

159
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:02,409
biases and others not so much with

160
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,568
ourselves so we can say wow that's great

161
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:07,240
anchoring biases you have there Remo

162
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,560
we've totally missed ours this has

163
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,870
serious implications when we're trying

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,310
to profile cyber actors because again

165
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,909
our biases are getting in the way of

166
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,490
what we're seeing so something else that

167
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:21,520
is of interest we find that cultural

168
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,870
values are very enduring now it is true

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,789
when you move to another country you

170
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,099
will pick up the values of that new

171
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,740
country but it doesn't fully embed

172
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,880
itself into the family into the

173
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,909
structure there the family structure

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,030
until the third generation and even then

175
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:39,639
having grown up I think on what fourth

176
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,650
generation yeah third or fourth

177
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,349
generation in my family no fourth I

178
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,109
still see in my parent yeah I see in my

179
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:47,000
parents some of the

180
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,670
values that I was like are you kidding

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,500
nobody does that juice in our house you

182
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,540
know so it still takes a little while

183
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,820
longer and we find that as certain

184
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,740
communities live together - they they

185
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,540
reinforce those old cultural values so

186
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,870
there's an even longer transition on it

187
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,460
so technology may be universal but the

188
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,800
thought processes are not and this was

189
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,270
Hofstede whose framework cultural

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,230
framework i used that's one of his

191
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,729
quotes so I said I'm not really good

192
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,470
about having to do deal with

193
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,840
interviewing people anybody who'd like

194
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,310
the Big Bang Theory okay

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,349
so there was a time there was one

196
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,370
episode where I think Amy asked Sheldon

197
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,260
about whether he wants to do a

198
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,610
experiments on humans and I think he

199
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,170
said that was like one of the few forms

200
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,780
of human interaction that he actually

201
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,180
liked he found enjoyable so that's kind

202
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,770
of how I'm not Sheldon but I do find it

203
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,220
a little difficult to do deal with

204
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,159
people one-on-one so I thought let's

205
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,520
find data and I can use observables and

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,870
go ahead and do it this way you know

207
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,010
what eleven million records can't be

208
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,690
wrong right so I said if I do that I've

209
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,520
got to find ways to I'm gonna have to

210
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,290
process it like think of like a data

211
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,940
scientist but I want to put it inside

212
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,840
this cultural framework I'm gonna do

213
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,270
observation because I don't want to have

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,070
to talk to the subjects and worry about

215
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,030
injecting my biases or worship just

216
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,530
interacting then we had the mitre cybox

217
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,169
framework that I wanted to use their

218
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,090
cyber observables and so I wanted to put

219
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,430
all these together and see what insights

220
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,590
I could come up with something that kind

221
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,730
of resonated with me and all this if any

222
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,960
of you have written any software of

223
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,300
course you could appreciate this quote

224
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
software the mind is how Hofstede

225
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,410
defines culture I thought that's really

226
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,850
nice why you did think of it because we

227
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,020
are kind of programmed to do things we

228
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,240
don't even realize we're doing it we're

229
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,289
processing it so fast especially when

230
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,000
we're talking about the online

231
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,099
environment where we don't really have

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,990
to have as much time to sit and evaluate

233
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,380
what's happening we have to kind of

234
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,110
respond to the alerts and informational

235
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,130
messages that we get interestingly

236
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,310
enough when I was out at work professor

237
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,189
Tim Watson actually turned me on to this

238
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,930
book called the geography of thought by

239
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,779
Richard Nisbett and something that he

240
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,888
had done was he looked at a bunch of

241
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,269
he and his he looked at several studies

242
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,399
that were done by various people in his

243
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,620
one of his big insights was based on

244
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,199
cultural background people literally see

245
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,120
the world differently and so for us in

246
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,790
the West who often we teach things in

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,620
terms of objects we say you know this is

248
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,910
the you know we we have a server you're

249
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,610
going to attack the server you're going

250
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,930
to do this isn't this that is a very

251
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,360
different perspective than someone who

252
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,269
may look at it functionally and say the

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,660
server is just one piece of a multi-step

254
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:35,019
process that I need to get through to

255
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,639
handle manages function so when you

256
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,709
consider it that way then you say well

257
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,319
if they're looking at that differently

258
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,180
what else are we looking at differently

259
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,699
culture and fluid Amin Augusta was also

260
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,319
helpful on my dissertation pointed me to

261
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:48,550
some some work and he was actually the

262
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:51,490
one who appointed me to call the

263
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,769
cultural framework by Hofstede so when

264
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,689
went on to say the culture influences

265
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,509
problem perception solution and

266
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:00,490
formation and selection of your

267
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:02,980
solutions so what he was basically he

268
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,050
had done some simulator tests where he

269
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,009
looked at students on from various

270
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,349
countries and he grouped them together

271
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,370
so he had students from India Brazil and

272
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,199
I free at the other countries I think

273
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,699
Germany was one of them and I forget

274
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,740
which other he had two other countries

275
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:16,170
in there and what he did was he put them

276
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,360
in this simulator and they had to

277
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,800
respond and how they would restate my

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,529
cold was one of his studies and he would

279
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,878
on his end he'd be tweaking with the

280
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,069
temperature and he found that some

281
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,069
students were very dramatic in their

282
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,449
changes and others were more slow to try

283
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,579
to you know they were more gradual in

284
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:38,139
their processing and amongst other

285
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,420
things he found out is he talked to this

286
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,949
as he dealt Donna had performed his

287
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,529
experiments and I spoke to the students

288
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,870
he found that the way that the people

289
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,420
looked at the problem itself that was

290
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,240
one issue and then how they came up with

291
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,979
the list of possible solutions that was

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,389
another cultural bias culturally based

293
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,920
inference there and then finally how

294
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:03,579
they selected again culturally

295
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,370
influenced so why this research because

296
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,559
a lot of people have done we've had

297
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,019
scientists do Studies on psychological

298
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,370
traits and they found that their their

299
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,640
success rate was

300
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,640
not significant enough to be able to

301
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,750
actually go with it and say this is what

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,029
we this is how we're going to predict

303
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,770
because psychology looks at the

304
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,470
individual culture looks at the group's

305
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,420
so what psychology does is it gives it's

306
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,890
a subset here that tells us I can look

307
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,770
at certain behaviors based on your

308
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,330
psychological profile but understanding

309
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,720
your norms that comes from your culture

310
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,940
so you may I may say if I want to do

311
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,339
this attack at you mmm that's kind of a

312
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,589
bridge too far I can't you know maybe I

313
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,870
have to face something of yours and I'm

314
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,940
going to not I'm gonna rub your nose in

315
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,560
it or maybe I might say no I'm not gonna

316
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,750
rub their nose in it that's just way too

317
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,760
that's that's not very cool that's not

318
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,779
very nice so that's where my cultural

319
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,830
values come in again we know that

320
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:02,170
nations behave differently how do we

321
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,910
know this because when we're looking in

322
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,439
threat intelligence we have these things

323
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,079
called TTP's right tactics techniques

324
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,060
and procedures and we collect them and

325
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,320
we separate them out when we said well

326
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,180
we know that this group does this and we

327
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,860
do this all I'm suggesting is that we

328
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,660
take these groupings of the different

329
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,940
TTP's and how do we put them in a

330
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,770
cultural framework and apparently

331
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,640
somebody liked my suggestions so the

332
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,279
folks over at the DST Oh in UK they said

333
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,830
they put together a matrix on human

334
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,390
responses and behaviors online and they

335
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,370
said oh we like that you did

336
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,630
quantitative analysis and that you used

337
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,330
a well-known frameworks that they're

338
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:42,250
using my they're using this method as

339
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,080
any studies in their matrix so what's

340
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,270
our real and desired outcome what do we

341
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,709
really want to get out of this what

342
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,689
better insights into our adversaries and

343
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:54,550
into ourselves too so mmm okay some good

344
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,740
studies to let you know about before we

345
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,060
get kicking off here there's a study

346
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,080
called the weird study this is probably

347
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,479
one of the best studies done in

348
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,160
psychology actually all the front when I

349
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,540
was working in hey RL all the behavioral

350
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,250
scientists were surprised that I knew

351
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,449
about the weird study they said do you

352
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,850
know about the weird study I said why

353
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,200
did do a little homework here the weird

354
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,450
study weird stands for Western educated

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,130
industrial developed okay that's the

356
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,570
rocking him there well if they found in

357
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,920
the weird study was that the vast

358
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,290
majority of the studies that had been

359
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,849
done on psychology was and

360
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,560
then probably get my numbers flipped

361
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,449
here but at least 80% of them have been

362
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,420
done on Western students on these weird

363
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:34,758
students and out of that group of

364
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:39,800
Western students the vast majority of

365
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:42,019
those were American students so we found

366
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,849
that when if you talk to some of the

367
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,500
psychologists they will be so bold as to

368
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,949
say the psychology is the study of

369
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,060
American college students I said that

370
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:54,050
was a little joke you don't have to

371
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,579
laugh that so we find that the so that

372
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,920
was Henry kind of Norns and they did

373
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,258
this study back in 2010 and that became

374
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,360
like a landmark study

375
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,730
gus-gus in Dorner Dominic Gus was very

376
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,500
helpful I mentioned about his simulators

377
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,660
and some of the decision-making he's

378
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,910
looking at how we make decisions on the

379
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,829
fly and he was looking at how cultural

380
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,959
values influence that there was a nice

381
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,599
study done by Morgan cross and rendao

382
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,359
who said nothing makes sense except in

383
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,660
the context of culture here they're

384
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,220
talking about how they you can you may

385
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,689
not understand why somebody makes a

386
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,040
decision they make but when you put in

387
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,209
in terms of cultural values then

388
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,880
suddenly everything falls into place

389
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,930
because that's again where what's normal

390
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,670
with what are the norms being

391
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,138
established and how we're even trained

392
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,689
when we're trained at school and

393
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,279
education in general whoever is training

394
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,910
us they're transmitting their cultural

395
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,100
values onto us also we found that a

396
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,569
michael wink off in 2013 had found that

397
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,550
students from restrained cultures or

398
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,930
closed societies were actually better at

399
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,910
math and science and their students from

400
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,099
indulging countries which was kind of an

401
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,209
interesting finding has you know when

402
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,980
you put all these things together you

403
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,899
say yourself what is this ho mean in

404
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,290
cyber surely we're not you know all

405
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,389
thinking the same then culture and

406
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,050
thought Nisbet also talked about the

407
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:11,000
east-west divide that's actually the big

408
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,219
 big push in his book is about the

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,680
cultural divide between east west and he

410
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,230
notices students from the East tended to

411
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,449
do better at algebra and arithmetic and

412
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,880
the Western counterparts pretended to do

413
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,649
better with geometry why was this was

414
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,939
because what a lot of these students

415
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,500
some and they looked at different

416
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:29,269
studies of course there had been done a

417
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,860
lot of the students from the West when

418
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,269
they're growing up and they might even

419
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,310
when they're toddlers right and they're

420
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,680
learning words they're learning the

421
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,880
words in terms of objects like ball cat

422
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,319
dog

423
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,230
students from the Eastern cultures were

424
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,880
learning when they learned the words

425
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,399
they're learning them like in function

426
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,339
so I think one of the ones that they

427
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,620
gave it as an example was one of the

428
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,540
languages there's no regular word for

429
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,360
white but it's like the white of snow

430
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,680
the white of cloud or whatever so

431
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,209
there's there's different types of

432
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,888
definitions to the TUI

433
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,550
a word that we just assume is an

434
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:05,870
adjective what he also found was there

435
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,849
was another study done when they found

436
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,620
that the students from the Eastern

437
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,720
cultures had more difficulty separating

438
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,069
objects from their surroundings so they

439
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,660
because they understood the functional

440
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,779
relationships they understood the

441
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:20,389
importance of background data and the

442
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,730
students from the West were worse at

443
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,529
being able to understand those

444
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,120
relationships but were better looking at

445
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:27,949
the objects so when they changed things

446
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,990
in the pictures what they found was the

447
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,490
students from the east if you if there

448
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,600
were changes in the background they saw

449
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,980
that but if there were changes in the

450
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,740
objects up front they didn't see it and

451
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,910
the students from the West it was the

452
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,199
reverse if there were changes in the

453
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,439
background they did not detect them as

454
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,719
quickly so what this means and we talked

455
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:47,660
about in and threat intelligence and

456
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,449
particularly in cyber deceptions we

457
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,279
talked about managing perception but

458
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,779
look what has to happen but before you

459
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,300
can perceive you have to be able to

460
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,439
sense if you're not sensing it I can do

461
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,500
a whole want with perception management

462
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:03,110
it doesn't matter it's wasted so there

463
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,720
was also the notion that we have one one

464
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,939
group of people what we consider we have

465
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,220
to take control like with our cyber kill

466
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,439
chain we talked about owning servers

467
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,179
taking over establishing our foothold

468
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,319
doing all these other things we have

469
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,589
another group of people out there that

470
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,089
say um I really want to understand the

471
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,289
big picture overall and understand how

472
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,938
to manage all these functions and I

473
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,890
don't really necessarily need to own all

474
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,959
the functions I need to know when is the

475
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,400
best time that I want to do what I want

476
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,780
to do with function or prioritize my

477
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,330
needs so Hofstede he was this is the

478
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,010
framework that I used he has 6

479
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,750
dimensions to define culture he has a

480
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,549
hundred countries scores from 0 to 100

481
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,179
it's widely adopted framework was

482
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:46,070
actually used in management but it is

483
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,950
approved by the anthropology departments

484
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,010
or the sociology departments so they are

485
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,960
they are familiar with his work and they

486
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,790
the there are criticisms to his work I

487
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,530
will say that and that's why I use the

488
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,809
other ones to help fill in the blanks

489
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,780
because part of Hofstra is very good at

490
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,629
helping I can use his dimensions to help

491
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,299
me tell him tell me what I'm saying but

492
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,900
the why he could use a bit of

493
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:11,559
improvement

494
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,510
so his why he starts he gives very broad

495
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,360
explanation so you have to do some more

496
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,299
digging and find out more from the other

497
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,918
ones out there so he has six dimensions

498
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,960
I mentioned the first one I'm gonna do

499
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,100
this really quickly because I don't want

500
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,510
to spend a lot of time talking about the

501
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,389
cultures but I'll have happily talk

502
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,820
about to anyone who wants to afterwards

503
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,650
power distance this is how egalitarian

504
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,020
versus how authoritarian your societies

505
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,549
do you do you accept that everyone is

506
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,160
created equal or that some people are

507
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,780
more equal than others individualism

508
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,580
versus collectivism what is most

509
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,200
important when you make a decision do

510
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,879
you care most about your individual like

511
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,770
what what it means for you or maybe you

512
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,820
and your family we're very close circle

513
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,610
or do you care about what it means for

514
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,379
you your larger family your community if

515
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,320
I make a bad decision will I bring shame

516
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,410
upon my the people in general or if I

517
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,340
make a good decision will that elevate

518
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:05,169
all of us collectively so masculine

519
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,449
feminine this is the misc name dimension

520
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,760
this deals with how a society deals with

521
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,340
conflict masculine societies tend to be

522
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,780
more direct in it they also have these

523
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,610
are the set of societies that also have

524
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,160
very strong gender rules and then we

525
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,689
have our feminine societies have more

526
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,610
fluid gender rules and that's not to say

527
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,179
that the men are girly and the girls are

528
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,699
manly it's actually that they have less

529
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,169
of a the women are not expected to wear

530
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,760
a makeup all the time or they're not

531
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,520
expect there are not women's chores

532
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,910
there there the housework is shared

533
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,780
equally as is yard work so we find that

534
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,710
the feminine countries tend to be more

535
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,240
some that we talk about some of the

536
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,179
countries that have strong social

537
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,830
systems you know medicare medical for

538
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:49,360
all and free education and things like

539
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,480
that those are countries that tend to

540
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,699
have feminine values you'll also find

541
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,230
that in these countries that when they

542
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,390
get into conflict the masculine

543
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,230
countries there's kind of like a what

544
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,880
are you going to do about it

545
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,140
feminine countries are more like let's

546
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,840
negotiate even if they're not

547
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,460
negotiating in good faith

548
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,629
uncertainty avoidance how do you deal

549
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,700
with the the unknown are you curious or

550
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,960
you fearful this one has a lot of

551
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,760
implications when you think about what

552
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,940
happens when you're hacking I'm sorry

553
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,260
when you're defending long term

554
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,170
orientation versus short term

555
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,210
orientation just like it sounds some

556
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,980
some people are looking at what's

557
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,330
important for this quarter some people

558
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,760
are looking at what's important for

559
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:34,449
twenty years from now and then we have

560
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,460
our indulgence versus restraint this is

561
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,380
sometimes called your closed and open

562
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,210
societies who knows how to throw a party

563
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,940
who when they're throwing a party you

564
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,290
really can't tell that was me kind of

565
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,750
making it really short because I know

566
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,420
where I want to get to the studies these

567
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,010
are just I should probably have just cut

568
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,660
these slides here no they think about it

569
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,220
these slides there sure are just

570
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,540
depicting the different colors and

571
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,850
they're showing some of the behaviors

572
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,560
that are associated with the high ends

573
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,959
of and the low ends of the dimension on

574
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:08,710
the power distance one highest on one of

575
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:10,120
the highest power distance countries we

576
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,500
talked about Russia's one that has

577
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,050
they're like ninety six or something

578
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,110
like that for there or 93 Malaysia I

579
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,399
think it is was a hundred we talked

580
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,669
about the low end ones the green

581
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,230
countries Israel Austria they we showed

582
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,430
in the United States as Green there but

583
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,990
actually the United States is a little

584
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,730
closer to the middle there are quite a

585
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,460
few Western Europe European countries

586
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:34,780
that are much more egalitarian than

587
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,000
Americans our individualism versus

588
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,280
collectivism just like we suggest 'end

589
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,950
before so interesting finding here on

590
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,560
countries that are individualist we

591
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,960
found there there was a study done by

592
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:50,050
you and yang I think it was back many

593
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,820
years ago in the early 2000s I think and

594
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,350
they actually found that there is an

595
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,159
association of creativity with

596
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:59,560
individualist societies and there is a

597
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,810
less creativity in the collectivist

598
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,169
societies and suspect the the suspicion

599
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,730
is that the decisions are based on the

600
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,740
group's because they are based on the

601
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,260
what's best for the group this tempers

602
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,420
some of the excesses although they were

603
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:17,680
unable to explain in that study things

604
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,550
like flash mobs so we mentioned

605
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,710
masculine

606
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:24,639
in general so here we have our dark

607
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:27,930
countries or see our Japan would be an

608
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,200
example of a very masculine culture

609
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,710
Norway

610
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,270
I think Norway Iceland Sweden Finland

611
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,670
those are more more of the feminine

612
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,250
countries humility is highly valued in

613
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,110
these countries that are feminine so

614
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,430
they may keep it close to their vest

615
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,719
with their skills are because they don't

616
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:48,070
like to brag uncertainty avoidance our

617
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,220
dark countries again are the ones that

618
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,570
are very high in they're fearful in

619
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,450
terms of what's new and what they don't

620
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,830
understand so the outcome of that is

621
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,620
when you're trying to control everything

622
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,210
you're going to be very precise because

623
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,439
you you want to make sure that you can

624
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,350
control for every situation

625
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,890
lighter countries are more creative more

626
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,199
curious so they tend to they'll try

627
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,520
anything so we'll think about what that

628
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,950
means when we talk about like we're

629
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,980
looking at doing some attribution work

630
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:21,640
are we would we expect countries that

631
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,990
are very precise to some of these high

632
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,670
uncertainty avoidance countries would we

633
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,500
expect more surgical attacks from them

634
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,180
then maybe we would from their

635
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,320
counterparts who might have a lot of

636
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:34,660
bloatware in their attacks long term

637
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,490
orientation short term orientation this

638
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,370
associates the long term orientation

639
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,520
associates with holism and of course our

640
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,689
short term orientation that's that again

641
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,800
associates with object-oriented thinking

642
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,960
and of course indulgence versus

643
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,550
restraint I have mentioned that the dark

644
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,560
countries there they tend to be better

645
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,600
at the math and science they also don't

646
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,020
like to Telegraph much about what

647
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,110
they're doing and our lighter countries

648
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:05,500
which are the closed societies I I have

649
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:09,520
a typo here hmm okay my countries that

650
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,650
are light I'm looking at those those

651
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,139
actually should be my restrain ones in

652
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,000
the dark countries and indulgence but

653
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,410
the indulgent countries don't do close

654
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,660
to the vest I have my bullets mixed

655
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,420
there they're actually selling they like

656
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,970
to celebrate in the indulgent countries

657
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,500
and so they're more willing to brag

658
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,380
about what they've done as opposed to

659
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,690
their counterparts who are more closed

660
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,230
and keep it close to the vest like I

661
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,980
said earlier

662
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,779
now now I get to get to the fun part so

663
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,580
we have this study we have the study

664
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,139
data here when I there were several

665
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,399
studies that I've done because I wanted

666
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:46,449
to understand a little bit more about

667
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:50,018
attackers defenders and victims so being

668
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:52,450
poor and not being funded at first I did

669
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:54,429
a study looking at DNS SEC because I

670
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,950
also like DNS I have a little DNS

671
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:58,120
addiction going on and so I said let's

672
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,830
see who all just signed their zones

673
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,320
what's the first thing you do in DNS SEC

674
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:07,260
and anybody familiar with DNS SEC okay.i

675
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,439
anybody actually run anything with it

676
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,600
yeah

677
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,179
okay so signing your sons the easy part

678
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,980
managing the keys is not exchanging the

679
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,389
keys it's not so I thought let's see who

680
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,399
just like thought that this would be a

681
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:21,699
good idea to sign their zones at least

682
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,049
and the funny thing I have had a friend

683
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,669
that was working at ICANN at the time

684
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:26,529
and told him about this study and he

685
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,080
actually shared with me that I think was

686
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:31,299
Poland not only sign their zone but they

687
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,240
like made all the subdomain sign their

688
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,320
zones too so were they the country

689
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,179
actually did that which I thought was

690
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,049
kind of interesting Poland being one of

691
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:41,919
those high uncertainty avoidance

692
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:43,269
countries so yeah so anyways so I just

693
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,860
looked at you signed their zones back in

694
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:46,840
2015 it was just a simple shot in time

695
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,469
working with a friend of mine and then

696
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,209
then I got because of that study and a

697
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,760
couple other studies I managed to get

698
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,399
some funding from i ARPA to do a study

699
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,539
with a lot of data and that's how I got

700
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:00,729
the zone h archive which we'll be

701
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,230
talking about and i use internet world

702
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,519
stats because when you're trying to look

703
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,450
at all these populations you want to

704
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,950
make sure especially if you're doing

705
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,559
correlations that you can at least

706
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:13,659
account for for the population and

707
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:15,460
normalize your data so zone h let's talk

708
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,740
about that this is an example right here

709
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,649
of pointing to the back of me and

710
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,059
there's nothing behind me these are some

711
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:24,010
examples of some of the web faces that

712
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,139
were to face teasing zone h and you can

713
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,620
see here that we have lots of different

714
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:31,299
things we can look at that we that I

715
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,129
have mentioned like bringing other

716
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,250
majors in would be probably pretty

717
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,380
relevant symbolism on the one that looks

718
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,779
to be something like Isis if it is or

719
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,669
not it is a Saudi Saudi Lord is actually

720
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:45,730
a Saudi Arabian citizen a citizen or

721
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:48,010
group the Bulgarian cyber army real

722
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,539
is from Bulgaria and you can see the

723
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,769
very different styles and what they're

724
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:55,690
doing when they're hacking the websites

725
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:57,130
there here we have Iran and Turkey for

726
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,990
those of you who are familiar with VSD

727
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:02,019
you can appreciate the symbolism of the

728
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,970
daemon there you can see that Iran mr.

729
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:05,740
terror here that's the Iranian flag in

730
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,440
the background now you can see here that

731
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,090
there's other information that's showing

732
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,730
up on here that's kind of interesting in

733
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,990
addition to the symbolism right so here

734
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,120
they're going and they're listing other

735
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,500
groups on mr. terror was here they're

736
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,928
listing other groups that they work with

737
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,149
or there so can we do some Ling Kagura

738
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,519
few with that right we have extracted

739
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:25,928
I'll get it out of there but that's why

740
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,639
I said yeah maybe working with someone

741
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,350
who's familiar with natural language

742
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:31,389
processing or linguistics in general

743
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,129
they can extract that data out there and

744
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:34,600
start grouping them and we can start

745
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,340
seeing these relationships between these

746
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,320
different groups

747
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,080
similarly with our friend here on the

748
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,220
this Turkish group here they're here

749
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,960
they're there telling more about

750
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,690
themselves they apparently like freebsd

751
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,159
linux AIX which i don't even if that's

752
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,700
still around and then they're mentioning

753
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,169
Windows and I'm not sure sure why this

754
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,200
is an example of what one of the records

755
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,460
look like okay so you can see that

756
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,250
there's a lot of different things to

757
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,070
parse through here you'll see here that

758
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,440
on the top here we've got that's the

759
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:09,490
date that it was reported this is the

760
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,649
date once it's accepted and they so Nate

761
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,260
says yes this is legitimate we verified

762
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:16,629
it they will fill in that date this is

763
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,100
the groups handled name so this is where

764
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,269
the first fun part for the cyber people

765
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:26,199
coming you have to do your attribution

766
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:28,809
you many hackers is who that ymh is they

767
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,330
tell you the actual site that they

768
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,490
hacked right you got the domain and the

769
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,379
page and they give you the IP address as

770
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,549
a web server so they did that with and

771
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,620
they telling you what operating system

772
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,500
they're running what software version on

773
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,539
that so Linux Apache why they did it how

774
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,210
they did it and then they you actually

775
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,429
have this is actually the mirror site

776
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,529
that has the actual defacement on it so

777
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,760
if you decide to ever do anything with

778
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,769
this data I have to tell you right now

779
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,070
do not click on anything on the mirror

780
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:59,320
site so the malware is there which also

781
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,840
present presents another a hopper

782
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,040
to download and collect the malware get

783
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,600
the hashes on the malware and see what

784
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,030
malware patterns were also seeing -

785
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,879
who's choosing what type of malware to

786
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,800
use so we have a lot that we can look at

787
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,760
here and there's because of time I'm not

788
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,200
going to go through all the fields

789
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,210
because I want to go through the studies

790
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,160
too but that's how you savory faced it

791
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,850
if this one was not yet published

792
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,340
because they're waiting to make it

793
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,199
public this is an important field right

794
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,399
here this is the unique identifier for

795
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,530
the record so you don't want to lose

796
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,090
track of that but what you can do is

797
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,530
when you when you go to this site here

798
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,550
then you can go ahead and pull all the

799
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,720
text out of the site you can pull the

800
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,200
images down and you can do whatever you

801
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,120
want with that - so when I talk about

802
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,830
interdisciplinary nature here we have

803
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,520
something that is of interest to the

804
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:44,949
data scientist the cyber people and of

805
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,129
course the behavioral scientists so on

806
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,390
the for the cyber people the fabric

807
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,580
people have to go ahead and do all the

808
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,990
attribution on this okay because they're

809
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,189
not telling you where they're from and

810
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,810
even if they're telling you where

811
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,100
they're from sometimes it's not where

812
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,480
they're really from so there's a Turkish

813
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,040
group that calls themselves Canadians

814
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,150
they're not so there's a lot of fun

815
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,560
things that we can do with this and I'd

816
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,020
love more than anything to be able to

817
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,310
have a group of students that I could

818
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,670
work with from each of the different

819
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,990
disciplines and say let's focus on this

820
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,790
particular group of attackers because

821
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,160
we've got 15 years worth of records here

822
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,470
right let's look at this particular

823
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,790
group of attackers and see what see

824
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,650
their progression how they've changed

825
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,020
their style over the years if they've

826
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,220
changed their style at all what what

827
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,139
have they done with their targets how

828
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,250
they changed their output on what

829
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,640
they're doing because they're telling

830
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:36,250
you everything here anyways so this one

831
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,070
took a little while to Novato this is a

832
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,200
portrait Paraguayan one again and the

833
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,399
Paraguay Paraguay and Brazil apparently

834
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,650
having some issues here we have

835
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:50,560
patriotism he chose to use a sequel

836
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:52,180
injection so 2014 before I got the Stone

837
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,040
Age data I think it the design age data

838
00:30:52,180 --> 00:31:01,150
until late 2014 early 2015

839
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,409
so the zone age data before that I we

840
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,870
were just trying to get some interest in

841
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,580
the work we were doing so looked at some

842
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,860
technology adoption rates and said who's

843
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,320
getting onto Facebook Twitter and

844
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,310
LinkedIn know Twitter was knew enough at

845
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,149
the time that I couldn't even do a

846
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,418
correlational now

847
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:18,789
on the Twitter data because it was still

848
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:20,710
we were still just getting the people

849
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:22,539
country income countries were still

850
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,809
coming online with Twitter at the time

851
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:27,219
so we looked at it we looked at we used

852
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,379
a slightly different method to evaluate

853
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,999
Twitter than we did the other two but

854
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:32,709
Facebook and LinkedIn had been around

855
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:36,509
for a while and we had made some

856
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:39,159
assumptions that such social media might

857
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:42,039
appeal to people from individualist

858
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:45,429
countries so we thought we'd run through

859
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:48,219
and see what we actually would find so

860
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:50,440
what we ended up finding was that oh and

861
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:52,929
we also because not all of the services

862
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,519
had been and believe it or not when we

863
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,919
were looking for at the early years of

864
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,089
some of these things we couldn't we

865
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,460
there were some countries who couldn't

866
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:03,009
get a full 20% on the Internet at the

867
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,690
time so we had to eliminate those

868
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:07,889
countries too but here's what we found

869
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:11,679
so we found that Facebook the adopted

870
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:13,449
all three social media actually ones

871
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,599
that we looked at associated with

872
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,799
indulgence so we ran correlation and

873
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,239
interesting thing and here's where your

874
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,469
data science comes in some of you were

875
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:23,529
probably already familiar with this

876
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:25,269
none of this data is is ever normally

877
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:26,259
distributed so we had to run Spearman

878
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,700
correlations when we ran our

879
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,809
correlations and we hit when we did our

880
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,950
group compares since we had a run

881
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:32,408
mann-whitney because these are all

882
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,599
nonparametric tools that you can use to

883
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,679
do your evaluation otherwise if you

884
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,408
tried running a Pearson correlation

885
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,330
you're going to get your findings well

886
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:41,979
most a lot of people might not know to

887
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,519
challenge it your findings are not going

888
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:46,979
to be accurate so Facebook we found the

889
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,019
indulgence we had a strong correlation

890
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:52,389
based on human behaviors anything above

891
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:54,039
0.5 for your r-value is considered a

892
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:57,008
strong correlation in human behaviors

893
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,029
even though and straight non-human

894
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,529
behaviors we're looking at something

895
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:02,710
closer to 0.8 to get a good strong

896
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,389
correlation so we found that we had a

897
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,749
strong correlation on Facebook adoption

898
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:08,918
we had a moderate correlation with

899
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:11,289
collectivism and short term orientation

900
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,559
for the Facebook users we found that on

901
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:16,779
LinkedIn that we had egalitarianism and

902
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,908
short-term orientation we also found

903
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:20,919
that strong indulgence of showing up and

904
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,899
I remember I said with Twitter I didn't

905
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,570
have enough data to run a lot nice long

906
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:26,918
correlation on it so I we did the group

907
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,590
comparisons with the mann-whitney

908
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,220
and we found that the who barely had a

909
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,658
hit on the masculine dimension and we

910
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:40,899
found that really strong indulgence

911
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:42,039
showing up DNS SEC similarly we because

912
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,168
we were looking at a point in time we

913
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:46,269
just did a quick rapid group comparison

914
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,889
and we found that the the it actually

915
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:49,509
found us some pretty strong findings

916
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:51,340
here that when we looked at the

917
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:52,960
top-level domains and we pulled them

918
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,459
down from ICANN you saw who signed them

919
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,649
we found that the countries that were

920
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,289
low in power distance which means their

921
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:01,899
Galit aryan and they are high in

922
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:05,769
individualism and they are long-term

923
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:07,359
oriented oriented these countries tended

924
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:09,460
to be the ones that signed their zones

925
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:15,690
and of course their counterparts did not

926
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:19,929
so I mentioned I ARPA was very nice and

927
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:24,639
but the zone age data from years 1999 to

928
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,720
2014 and there were like I think like 12

929
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,139
million records in there or something

930
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,178
like that

931
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:33,250
so I they had said we want to see if we

932
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:36,220
can use culture to predict kinetic

933
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,510
events so they also gave me another

934
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:39,908
database to work with and that's the

935
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,950
mall IQs database which is all the

936
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,720
global news stories and so what we had

937
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,770
to do is we again we're pulling all this

938
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,629
together

939
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,869
and they want to see you have to use

940
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:51,940
Hofstede have to use the zone age data

941
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,079
and then we have the psych use data so

942
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,220
what I did was I said let's look at all

943
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,670
the kinetic events that happened

944
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,589
anything that had that went to from like

945
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,710
sanctions all the way up to some sort of

946
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:03,910
firing of bullets and those would be the

947
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,190
ones that I would say or Connecticut

948
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,930
would qualify as kinetic events so we

949
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,059
agreed upon that and when we looked at

950
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,308
the distribution for that we found that

951
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:14,410
there was nothing really special didn't

952
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:17,170
deviate much from Hofstede so I don't

953
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,879
have to do anything special here we

954
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,609
wanted to see what the relationship was

955
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,099
so I randomly chose because at the time

956
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,598
I wasn't really sure what what number

957
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:27,730
but it turned work I turned out to work

958
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,109
out well I said let's go anytime there's

959
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,349
a kinetic event let's look for something

960
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:34,328
in zone age that occurs within 30 days

961
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,010
of it it turns out that actually most of

962
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:40,230
the occurrences occur within 14 to 15

963
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:43,200
days of an event we've

964
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:46,890
also found that when I looked through

965
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,930
the data I had to put the pairs together

966
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,600
by the top-level domain

967
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,549
who's fighting so if it was India and

968
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,420
Pakistan having to go at each other is

969
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:59,250
that Syria and I'll I don't know Israel

970
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,840
having to go at each other that's how

971
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,570
all the pairings were done and then

972
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,600
looked for the top-level domains where a

973
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,910
patriotic revenge or political

974
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,368
defacement occurred pulled those out and

975
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,109
said okay if it was if it's if we use

976
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,080
the example of India and Pakistan I'd

977
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:18,509
say okay look for a PK or ID I think is

978
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,980
think India's ID or is it I n I forget

979
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,050
what their top-level domain is I think

980
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,090
it's I n now that I think about it okay

981
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,800
look for those ones to be in there in

982
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,109
the set there and see where how far

983
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,850
they're measuring off interesting thing

984
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:31,920
one of the interesting findings that was

985
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,470
kind of just mentioned is an incidental

986
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,180
was not every country leads with cyber

987
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,980
there's an assumption because we lead

988
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,350
with cyber and some of our adversaries

989
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,660
lead with cyber that everybody does but

990
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,250
actually found that some countries lead

991
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,868
with kinetic and followed with cyber so

992
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,780
looking for what we can actually find

993
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:54,570
here I mentioned the Emmanuel an annual

994
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,369
attribution process at the time none of

995
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,630
those records had been attributed so I

996
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:00,060
spent most of my time doing the

997
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,700
attribution on these these groups so the

998
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:06,930
result is I have about 1500 actors that

999
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:10,890
are attributed and yes the attribution

1000
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,839
was verified so can't share all of my

1001
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,009
sources but I will say that every actor

1002
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,530
that it was attributed had at least

1003
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,030
three sources that could could be used

1004
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,369
to do it and then I have a friend that

1005
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:24,090
worked over at DIA that actually said

1006
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,680
yeah you got this one right yes okay so

1007
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,660
once I had what are we going to find so

1008
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,000
again I mentioned kinetic profile showed

1009
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,879
no deviation from Hofstede profile which

1010
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,250
was great so what I found was attackers

1011
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,750
in general came from the authoritarian

1012
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,000
countries they're masculine and they're

1013
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,720
restrained and the victims tended to be

1014
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,220
masculine we'll revisit this masculine

1015
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,209
on the victims later too because we

1016
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,980
actually did little there was a

1017
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,540
follow-on study that was done we had

1018
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,369
this other group of actors that showed

1019
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,259
up that recall I call them the uninvited

1020
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,010
third parties so if two countries are

1021
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,410
having a go at it let's say we'll pick

1022
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,359
in India and Pakistan an Argentine

1023
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:00,850
hacking group might weigh in on the

1024
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,650
conflict and tell whichever side that

1025
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,029
they were opposing they'd say you're

1026
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,150
wrong and they'd go ahead and head to

1027
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,650
face the site so we had this group of

1028
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,240
third parties there was enough of them

1029
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,560
that I said let's look and see what we

1030
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,430
can find out about these and they tended

1031
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,660
to be authoritarian and values they were

1032
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,390
masculine and of course they were also

1033
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,859
from restrain societies and then we had

1034
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,390
some that we're both we looked at both

1035
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:25,660
the countries that were posed attackers

1036
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,529
attacked attackers and victims and we

1037
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,259
found that they tended to be

1038
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,660
authoritarian and restrained so I said

1039
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,859
let's one of my co-workers suggested at

1040
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,118
the time season one she trend the data

1041
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:39,609
char good idea so we did that so we

1042
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,619
found was as they went on as time goes

1043
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,779
on you see here our Thorat Aryan

1044
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:46,660
countries on the very short five-year

1045
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,369
interval very high in power distance but

1046
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,230
when we look back 10 years they're still

1047
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:52,359
it's still strong just not as strong so

1048
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,859
what we're finding actually was that the

1049
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,950
authoritarian countries they actually

1050
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:58,840
looked at this viewing viewed this

1051
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:01,720
attacking these websites and doing these

1052
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,880
patriotic and political type to face

1053
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,680
defacement says this is a good thing and

1054
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,570
so they encouraged it

1055
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,430
we found some quote we found a moderate

1056
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,040
correlation on the five-year interval

1057
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,330
with curiosity and as at the 10-year on

1058
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,950
your interval we saw that it was

1059
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,470
actually a little stronger so that over

1060
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:20,410
time is actually getting weaker and if

1061
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:22,480
you look at our 5-year on tenure on the

1062
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,549
open societies versus closed societies

1063
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,250
we found that strong on both but we

1064
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,990
found that again the over 10 years it

1065
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,380
was not as strong as it was at the first

1066
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,868
five years victims again we found a long

1067
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,150
term we found the short term orientation

1068
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,710
on that when we tried to correlate that

1069
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,720
over time when we trended it and we

1070
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,070
found that even though these on our

1071
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,430
previous when I had mentioned that they

1072
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,900
were feminine in value they when we have

1073
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,830
tried to trend what was happening over

1074
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,970
the long term we found that it was

1075
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:54,759
becoming less strong more more of the

1076
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,879
short term orientation and of course our

1077
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,410
uninvited Agana didn't try to slip

1078
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,200
through here quickly cuz I know sigh 5

1079
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,359
more minutes tear so we found on the

1080
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,368
study that indulgent countries actually

1081
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:07,720
not only they actually strongly

1082
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,820
correlated with long longer

1083
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,609
time interval so the thought behind this

1084
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,310
is that when there's a country's

1085
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:17,830
deciding whether to respond to a kinetic

1086
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,630
or a cyberattack and they're going to

1087
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,640
use the other method to do it there's an

1088
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,650
awful lot of generals have to and

1089
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,670
politicians have to decide on what

1090
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,310
they're going to do and what we found

1091
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:29,170
was that the indulgence societies take

1092
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,119
longer to make that decision the thought

1093
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,920
being that they have to weigh out all

1094
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,750
the options and they actually do care

1095
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,880
about something what everybody's saying

1096
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,040
in the room and think it through whereas

1097
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,359
the restrain societies there's somebody

1098
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,650
who's making a decision and they may

1099
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:42,759
listen to what you have to say but they

1100
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,619
already made the decision in their

1101
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,109
marching I this one is actually one that

1102
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:52,030
I'd love to do a follow-up on what and

1103
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:53,920
this one is the self-identified attack

1104
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,240
vector preferences so what I did was it

1105
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,160
took everyone's probably familiar with

1106
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,529
the miter saw box and with inside locks

1107
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,730
they have Capek Capek takes all of the

1108
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,050
different attack vectors groups them

1109
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,910
together into like 25 different

1110
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,650
groupings and you can take those

1111
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,868
groupings remember we saw in our earlier

1112
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,730
records they gave the attack vector that

1113
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:11,500
they used the attackers did so we found

1114
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,570
the ones that were common so let's use

1115
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,390
that and let's look at the group so that

1116
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,310
are self-identified so they may say I me

1117
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,170
an Iranian hacker group or something

1118
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,580
like that so I can compare them against

1119
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,760
the ones that are not self-identified

1120
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:26,859
eventually this is the study I'd like to

1121
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,930
do and if we find that we the

1122
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,759
self-identified or accurate predictors

1123
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,169
of the non self-identified then we would

1124
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,310
be in a good spot to actually predict

1125
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,869
what attack vectors people want so but I

1126
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,250
needed to have the baseline first on the

1127
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,650
self-identified since so that's what

1128
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,210
this study is here and there were some

1129
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,190
interesting findings on that so

1130
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,200
oday attacks because i remember thinking

1131
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,700
to myself when i saw this i was like who

1132
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,180
would burn to no day on a website to

1133
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,160
Faceman apparently some people who have

1134
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,129
who are very authoritarian and very

1135
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,640
restrained so there it does actually

1136
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,800
happen the brute force attacks I kind of

1137
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,210
expected that one to be a little more

1138
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,700
associated with masculine values because

1139
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,800
they don't really care what you're doing

1140
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,330
if you if you're upset about it because

1141
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,430
they're very direct in their conflict

1142
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:15,040
and sure enough we did get a hit on the

1143
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,200
masculine values configuration errors

1144
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,910
strongly associated with authoritarian

1145
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,859
countries and masculine values and the

1146
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,519
sequel injection again this is one that

1147
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:22,598
I thought the

1148
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,098
sequel injection being a little more

1149
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,109
elegant and say a brute-force attack

1150
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,609
might appeal to someone with high

1151
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:29,578
uncertainty values and sure enough there

1152
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:32,519
we go we have a high uncertainty values

1153
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:35,109
and then we have our social engineering

1154
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,558
associated with masculine and restrained

1155
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:40,659
countries interestingly enough on the

1156
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,999
the social engineering one of HOF states

1157
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:45,309
of things when he was talking about how

1158
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,759
the different culture issues technology

1159
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:47,979
different

1160
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,809
he said that men masculine countries

1161
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:51,339
tend to be more information seeking and

1162
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,989
feminine countries tend to be more

1163
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,339
information sharing and that kind of

1164
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,880
bear set out on their social engineering

1165
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:59,828
results so there was another study done

1166
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,449
where I was trying to get someone to get

1167
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,339
some other work done and I kinda figure

1168
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:05,169
if I pressured him by doing a study on

1169
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,599
social engineering victims in general

1170
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:09,249
just looking at the larger set as

1171
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,399
opposed to just the self-identified ones

1172
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:14,379
I'd see what came out and sure enough we

1173
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:16,749
found like victims of social engineering

1174
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,219
attacks shared these common traits they

1175
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:20,558
tended to be more individualistic tend

1176
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:24,909
to be egalitarian and they had long term

1177
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,619
orientation so the person I was trying

1178
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:28,029
to force to get along get some things

1179
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:29,979
done with a student named mark Glencoe

1180
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:31,899
he did a tenure analysis on the victims

1181
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:33,308
and what he found something they found

1182
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:35,439
that was overwhelmingly interesting

1183
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,269
fascinating to me was not only where the

1184
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:39,399
hunted the countries of all these

1185
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:42,939
defacements these government websites

1186
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:45,880
that have been defaced using these type

1187
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:47,859
of various attacks were we were

1188
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,749
masculine remember the former I our poor

1189
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,159
study I know I'm talking fast we also

1190
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:53,558
mentioned that the victims tended to

1191
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:55,359
have masculine feminine masculine values

1192
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:57,130
I'm sorry so he not only found that

1193
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,808
masculine values were across all

1194
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,849
cultures but this what I found was the

1195
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:02,619
most more significant finding was when

1196
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,689
he tried to tend to trend the value over

1197
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,789
the 10-year period the findings were

1198
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:10,569
constant which of course lends support

1199
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:11,799
to cultural values being enduring so no

1200
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:13,239
matter how much we try to train somebody

1201
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:14,679
to do something differently these

1202
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:16,779
cultural values are going to go ahead

1203
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:17,159
and take a overtake what we're doing

1204
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:23,939
here

1205
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:26,079
so three two minutes to get this okay

1206
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:27,609
conclusions so these studies were

1207
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,229
exploratory in nature and they were done

1208
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:31,359
to create baselines for predictive

1209
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:32,589
studies that are supposed to be underway

1210
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,190
but are not really underway because I

1211
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:36,680
haven't had time to do them and

1212
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,060
funding to do them cyber actors right

1213
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,710
now appear to have behaviors that

1214
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,779
associate with their cultural values and

1215
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,520
this is not surprising because when we

1216
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,630
talk about how we do kinetic war we

1217
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,700
understand we have to understand the

1218
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,280
cultural values of the person on the

1219
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,890
other side so why would cyber war be any

1220
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,950
different cultural values may or may not

1221
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:57,500
be perfect conductors but they do

1222
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,779
provide context and set the norms so we

1223
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,090
we may not be able to say that this

1224
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,980
particular actor out of this particular

1225
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,810
country we can't predict exactly what

1226
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,130
he's going to do but we can say he's

1227
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,549
probably not going to go there for this

1228
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:12,520
other thing because in the norms the

1229
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,510
reliance on data to inform the

1230
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,770
explanations and the behaviors well

1231
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,730
relatively new has been well received by

1232
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:23,690
parts of the US government

1233
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:25,220
our 5i partners and NATO says what's

1234
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,930
that I'll leave you with Hough steeds

1235
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,669
famous quotes this dominance of

1236
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,740
Technology over culture is an illusion

1237
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,120
software the machines may be globalized

1238
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,700
but the software of the minds that use

1239
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,240
them it's not so I think we have time

1240
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:47,180
for a couple of questions here two

1241
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:48,470
questions yes interesting as far as I

1242
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:52,190
was wondering if you have done anything

1243
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:55,660
on the shock effect on the culture

1244
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,000
whether they enforce them respect

1245
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,609
perceptions or its kind of enforce it if

1246
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,370
you change it or reinforce it and on the

1247
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,470
shock effects if you can categorize it

1248
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,020
under different headings whether it's

1249
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:11,509
gonna be to the security but it's

1250
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:18,200
personal financial or national security

1251
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:20,570
or religious sensitivities so no I have

1252
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,240
not but I will say since you brought up

1253
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:25,730
some of these other areas like financial

1254
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:30,169
and personal and whatnot there has been

1255
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:32,060
a Mis a tribunal see a ting certain

1256
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,440
countries was only wanting financial and

1257
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,509
then we find out years later that

1258
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,530
actually they go after financial with us

1259
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:41,660
because money buys what you want with

1260
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,210
what you really want to get to in our

1261
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,560
culture in our society but that may not

1262
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,120
necessarily be what they do in other

1263
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,140
countries so I know I'm not really

1264
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,750
during your question because I'm not

1265
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,990
really I can say I have not done their

1266
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:57,000
studies yet so but what I mean basically

1267
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,930
say you say everything is money are

1268
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,480
those sort of things that you are

1269
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,600
relating say suppose over here over here

1270
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,660
tell me the relationship with the fear

1271
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:10,770
the fear interference with what people

1272
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,480
are usually gonna look into but fear of

1273
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,720
course in different levels as I said you

1274
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,360
can have fear of say health yes going on

1275
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,040
right now is financial security or so

1276
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,310
you have your money in the bank and all

1277
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,960
of a sudden the banks collapse or

1278
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,549
something like that yeah so those are

1279
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,740
kind of like to the larger kinetic

1280
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,690
issues and there have been other there

1281
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,220
has been other work I believe done in

1282
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,350
the Social Sciences that I'm not

1283
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:37,049
familiar ways on that cuz I could only

1284
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:40,200
focus on how do I do this in the with

1285
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,940
just the cyber world right so but we do

1286
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,710
know that some societies tend to be more

1287
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,180
fearful of everything than other

1288
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,740
societies because they just don't trust

1289
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:51,419
with what it's not invented there so

1290
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:55,950
have you done anything if suppose that

1291
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:58,650
you have the say the web goes down and

1292
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,910
the internet and what's going to be the

1293
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:05,670
effect on the people how they're going

1294
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:06,870
to behave say a few days yes so it's

1295
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,820
funny you mentioned that that study has

1296
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,900
not been done and actually one of the

1297
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,730
things we talked about yesterday

1298
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,970
yesterday we were touring the cyber

1299
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:16,800
range was what happens we didn't do it

1300
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,750
we say we didn't say for the Internet

1301
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,180
but if you had a cyber physical attack

1302
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,070
where you took something down we look at

1303
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,399
everything in very constrained systems

1304
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:28,730
but if you've maybe shut off the water

1305
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,080
supply to a town right in cyber physical

1306
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,030
well there's always that one person in

1307
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,759
town that's kind of like the survivalist

1308
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:37,320
may have all these backup things there

1309
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,910
so what how would they behave in that

1310
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,930
situation because they would normally

1311
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,210
have enough for themselves that they

1312
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,500
might be able to sell to the town or

1313
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,090
sell to other people in the town and

1314
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,640
then that would be a very interesting

1315
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,620
study just to see how the different the

1316
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,859
wild cards would act in this situation

1317
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:55,109
and then would we be able to maybe have

1318
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,480
our National Guard be able to take this

1319
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:01,270
information and figure out before things

1320
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,220
go crazy in the town how to get some

1321
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,770
of normality working with that person

1322
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:09,399
first so now those studies have not been

1323
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:11,410
as I know they have not been done but it

1324
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,410
is another question with just one more

1325
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,569
one more thing I'm saying that suppose

1326
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,540
something big happens at the second ad

1327
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,400
or whatever and then what are the

1328
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,400
chances that they shot on the wall

1329
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,800
internet or they censored in certain

1330
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,600
aspect or just the financial so again it

1331
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,650
depends on the country that we're

1332
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,240
talking about and the values of the

1333
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,520
people who are done this so if you have

1334
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,439
something major that happens like we

1335
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,560
already have a history in the Middle

1336
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,390
East where Iran has shot you know has

1337
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,920
closed off the internet we had I believe

1338
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:46,270
it was Egypt close to shut it down

1339
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,820
Turkey okay

1340
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,410
I think Turkey was more recent right so

1341
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,420
when we know that these countries that

1342
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,759
tend to be more authoritarian in nature

1343
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,500
they will shut down the internet if that

1344
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,340
happened in America I can tell you right

1345
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,690
now they're not shutting down the

1346
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,090
internet because it costs way too much

1347
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,650
money and there is in no way the of the

1348
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:06,580
financial community would put up with

1349
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:09,400
that so we will work to to work around

1350
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:11,110
it and we may do something like we we

1351
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,780
may reduce some of the services or

1352
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,950
change the prioritization of the traffic

1353
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,900
that comes in but we will keep the

1354
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:23,500
internet up just because that's our

1355
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:31,480
value system good thank you sure any

1356
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:33,580
other questions yeah what is the what is

1357
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,340
the a methodology to actually verify the

1358
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:38,560
the ground truth because I understand

1359
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,140
that you know the data-driven analysis

1360
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,810
has to be verified against the ground

1361
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,299
truth I'm always technically curious you

1362
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:48,009
know how the ground truth acquisition is

1363
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,830
done and then the second question is

1364
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:53,140
that will you worry about deception

1365
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,210
meaning that if our adversaries are

1366
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,339
become aware of the knowledge or the

1367
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,530
information that we derive out of this

1368
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,540
study what kind of a change they might

1369
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:05,380
what kind of a strategy they might adopt

1370
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:07,930
right to actually avoid future you know

1371
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,000
attribution or being accurately profiled

1372
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:12,069
at least right so they would have to

1373
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,330
there's a very good question and it's a

1374
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,240
two-part question so we'll start with

1375
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:17,710
the ground truth one

1376
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:21,379
when we first started this this exercise

1377
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,570
the zone age data was sealed attrition

1378
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,030
org that was recognized as a source of

1379
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,530
ground truth data but even with that

1380
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,270
like I said I had attribute the

1381
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,850
different actors who were saying they

1382
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,490
did that they had actually admitting to

1383
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,500
doing the attack so to that I would look

1384
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,419
for I look for news stories I checked

1385
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,010
the social media again these could all

1386
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,450
be falsified but then I had that other

1387
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,090
thing in my hip pocket called my friend

1388
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:46,460
that work at DIA and I said that I ran

1389
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,840
the list past him to some of the groups

1390
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,020
that were really hard to do like I mean

1391
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,369
I showed you to Nevada I had a friend at

1392
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,960
the University of Warwick that actually

1393
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:56,840
spent a lot of time going through social

1394
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,850
media as well as other sites to look to

1395
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,650
see what he could find on that one that

1396
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,080
he actually on some of the Arab dirt

1397
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:06,590
Arabic groups he found that some of them

1398
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,690
were really into cars so he joined the

1399
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,950
different clubs on cars said that he

1400
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,440
could and he actually has a native

1401
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,359
Arabic speaker too so he was we were

1402
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,250
able to do a lot of you know there was a

1403
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,140
when I say it was painstaking because

1404
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,660
out of 11 million records we only have

1405
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:23,118
1500 actors attributed so that's you

1406
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,430
know so that that's the first part of it

1407
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,770
in some of the early ones too I even

1408
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,640
looked to see if they had been convicted

1409
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,950
look for it because if they had been

1410
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,700
convicted that's yet us yeah that's a

1411
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:38,060
sure point of ground truth now on the

1412
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:40,310
actual news story the other piece was

1413
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,049
she said something about was that was

1414
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,779
the ground truth right yeah so we okay

1415
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:47,180
ground truth data the customer said look

1416
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,160
we're gonna use IQs the news stories

1417
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,940
that's one source of ground truth data

1418
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,379
and he they actually specified the zone

1419
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,510
age data as a source of ground truth

1420
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,790
data even though I had to do the

1421
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,740
attribution piece on the victim site you

1422
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,480
don't have to do as much to verify it

1423
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,220
because you could just you you see the

1424
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,890
site that you could have the domain and

1425
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,649
you can just go to the mirror site

1426
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,910
verify it and you know okay so that's

1427
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,540
like you know top-level Damien that's

1428
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:16,129
that's a lot easier to do so but one the

1429
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,420
victim site interestingly enough

1430
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,670
something I didn't share about zone age

1431
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,350
because we were kind of rushed there's a

1432
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,910
field in there that gives the country at

1433
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,009
the very end it spells it out like it

1434
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,500
might I think the example I used to had

1435
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,040
Saudi Arabia was the country that was

1436
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,230
attacked

1437
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,120
United States well what that means was

1438
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:34,490
that this server was actually physically

1439
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,830
housed in United States so when I had

1440
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:40,069
the student doing the ten year study on

1441
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:41,870
the victims zone age data only gives the

1442
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:45,290
country where the servers housed from

1443
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:47,750
the years 2010 I think up to 20 doctor

1444
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,779
present and we only had up to 20 the end

1445
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,160
of 2014

1446
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,110
everything else he had to go back and

1447
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,220
look at and find out what was the a

1448
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,710
autonomous system number associated with

1449
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,080
is that group of IP addresses and see if

1450
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,760
that autonomous system at number matched

1451
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,590
one of the countries that would have

1452
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,760
that they would be able to dole out

1453
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:12,110
those IP addresses so that was a bit of

1454
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,480
an exercise for him because he's not a

1455
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,980
programmer either and I told him I was I

1456
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,810
did some ID help him a little bit with

1457
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,630
some of the cleaning but I find that in

1458
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,730
general data cleaning is is the biggest

1459
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,860
task in this in doing something like

1460
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:32,090
this so that was how we got through the

1461
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:34,240
ground truth on is okay any other

1462
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,240
questions

1463
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,439
[Applause]

1464
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,020
you
