25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,408
hopefully good hopefully you're safe

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,140
hopefully you're saying I can't

27
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,250
guarantee the same part being that

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,909
you're probably all working out of the

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,670
house and so what what I'd like to do

30
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,700
today is kind of walk through some

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,930
regulatory stuff this is typically not

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:55,320
the the most fun part of of what you're

33
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:57,469
going to do as a as a a straight

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,029
professional going forward however

35
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,829
everything that I'm going to talk to you

36
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,840
about today is going to be paramount

37
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:11,340
going forward the the amount of

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,650
regulatory pieces are are growing and as

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,980
you look at me even going through all

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,590
this

41
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
this kovat stuff the the arguments

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,690
they're having at a federal and a state

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,890
level on who's in charge of what and how

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,900
it will it will come - it will come - to

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,268
bite people at some point if they don't

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,849
if they don't prepare for it and the

47
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,760
more that you prepare for it looking at

48
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:39,209
your future careers the better so with

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,859
that I'm gonna get started and see if we

50
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,239
can't get this thing rolling so

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,519
hopefully if you take aways that I will

52
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,640
leave you with understand the

53
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,390
implications of laws in place and coming

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,640
up how to comply with them how to

55
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,608
understand you know so your contracts

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,458
data flows are going to be impacted some

57
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,190
ways to help you drive implementation

58
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,790
and quite frankly for the organizations

59
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,040
that you will end up working for the

60
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,390
ability to make things a competitive

61
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,720
advantage using security and privacy so

62
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,569
working towards driving security and

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,329
privacy up to the front of the line not

64
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,238
necessarily the back of the line in the

65
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,130
way the contract simply get done is they

66
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,799
get through all of the the happy stuff

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,349
upfront where they're buying what the

68
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,540
price is and at the very very end it'll

69
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:39,869
be hey your security guys sign off on

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,510
this and what what I'm trying to do for

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,669
my company and for other companies is

72
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,209
help move security up to the front of

73
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,340
the line

74
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,530
so essentially being at the table for

75
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,919
all of these the individual negotiations

76
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,590
and then quite frankly there's some some

77
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,959
personal professional benefits that will

78
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,400
be there so what I'll do is first give

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,590
you a little bit about car because most

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,620
people don't know who we are

81
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,530
some quick facts and figures but first

82
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,419
we are our job is to power the world's

83
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,299
most trusted on little marker places and

84
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,639
we do this through innovation technology

85
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,430
and people we are based in Carmel

86
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:22,440
Indiana I take care for about 15,000

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:25,830
people in the US Mexico Canada UK and

88
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,820
Brussels and and we sell cars for a

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,609
living we typically off lease vehicles

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,659
we do a lot of it and as you can see we

91
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,100
are in really about 75 countries by the

92
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,240
time you get through every place that a

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,650
vehicle we bought multiple locations

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,080
about three and a half million vehicles

95
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:48,070
sold about half of those are sold online

96
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,919
and we write all of our own software so

97
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,820
we there right or we buy companies that

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,580
are writing the software so with that

99
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,200
let's get on to some interesting stuff

100
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,750
so doesn't seem odd people will give

101
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,820
their personal data away you know I I

102
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,800
really want that flashlight app and when

103
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,260
that flashlight comes with my phone it

104
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,310
says hey I need access all your contacts

105
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:18,250
uh they don't but if you will give it to

106
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,990
them it's great people will tell their

107
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,980
innermost secrets to all their friends

108
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,110
and so on and so on people take pictures

109
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,110
all over the place and post them online

110
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,820
you know in fact I read the the privacy

111
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,970
notes for Facebook several years ago and

112
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,580
it basically said they own those so your

113
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,130
pictures but Facebook owned them in in

114
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,620
the world where we're at right now and

115
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,960
moving forward privacy is going to be

116
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:49,360
huge okay it's one thing for for you to

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,580
give up your personal privacy for

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,000
something it's another thing for a

119
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,580
company to take it away so that's where

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,860
the the big divide is so we'll we'll

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,010
start a little bit with you know where

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,730
and what to be worried about today we're

123
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,750
gonna focus on the green parts here so

124
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:13,450
GDP are CCPA there's some existing laws

125
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,230
in the u.s. today that are are in place

126
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,570
for people in school you would have

127
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,880
heard about FERPA a hip and health care

128
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:25,270
or copper for kids there are some laws

129
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,250
in Canada called Pepita that covers all

130
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,049
of Canada and then there's some

131
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,630
interesting stuff happening in Russia

132
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,420
and China basically one of the

133
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,510
interesting things in Russia is if you

134
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:41,139
create data there you will automatically

135
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,580
give a copy of that data to Russia so

136
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,860
you know maybe instead of them

137
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,979
historically taking it you're gonna give

138
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,650
it to them so this is the areas to be

139
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,409
concerned with we will see there's new

140
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,739
laws in Brazil there's new laws popping

141
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:59,080
up all over the world and so you can

142
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,189
expect this wherever you end up working

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,180
you will start to see some of these laws

144
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:09,279
so first probably good to differentiate

145
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,159
typically I think about security as

146
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,620
locking the door so nobody can get in

147
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:16,810
when I think about privacy it's more

148
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,509
about closing the shades so you know

149
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,240
people can't look in the windows and

150
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:25,629
these two together help provide the

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,069
overall security blanket for for the

152
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:32,020
organizations you will end up working

153
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:35,139
for so the the way that we we look at

154
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,979
laws today there's laws on the rest of

155
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:43,889
the world there are existing laws in the

156
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:47,430
US and the u.s. is mostly a patchwork of

157
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,259
laws so there's laws that are sectoral

158
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,979
around like education around health care

159
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:57,339
but nothing that is overriding CCPA

160
00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:00,938
which we'll talk about is will be that

161
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:03,129
the toughest in the US and then NY DFS

162
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:07,539
this is Department Financial Services in

163
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:10,539
New York covers security controls for

164
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,180
banks insurance companies so very

165
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:16,419
particular to the you know the Wall

166
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,879
Street space but we have a company there

167
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,120
that is a small insurance company and so

168
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,639
we're covered by NY DFS and then GDP our

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,300
is the the toughest privacy regs in the

170
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,419
world right now

171
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,339
and my guess is you've heard about some

172
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,380
of that and I'll cover a little bit but

173
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,979
just to give you kind of a flavor of

174
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,729
some of it at the end of the day what we

175
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,079
care about from a privacy standpoint

176
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,839
really for a security standpoint but

177
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:47,339
from a privacy standpoint what is the

178
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,880
data okay what data are we trying to

179
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:55,090
take care for in Europe when they look

180
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,180
at GDP are it is

181
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:01,360
two categories of data so it's things

182
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,060
like name location basically it's

183
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,020
personal data but it's not in-depth

184
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,189
personal data there's a second set of

185
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,829
sensitive data that covers race opinions

186
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,830
it even goes into trade union membership

187
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,700
so in Germany everybody belongs to a

188
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,760
trade union and this is sensitive data

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,530
anything genetic or biometric will be

190
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,760
considered sensitive data and you have

191
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,350
to manage those things a little bit more

192
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,520
stringently than you do personal data

193
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,160
and then CCPA in california will add

194
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,880
more things so what you start to see

195
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,969
with more of these laws is that you

196
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,500
start to include things like IP you

197
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,660
start to include things like email

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,570
address so you know I have five

199
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,750
different email addresses but I could be

200
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,210
offended if somebody gave up one of

201
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,660
those email addresses and we'll talk a

202
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,460
little bit about a lawsuit in in Europe

203
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,189
on this particular point a little later

204
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,620
and then there's the things you would

205
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,300
normally expect to see that are

206
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,850
sensitive Social Security driver's

207
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,540
license things like that are covered as

208
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,570
well but they're typically covered in in

209
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,110
Congress with something else that tied

210
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,360
to your name okay and but when when

211
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,550
we're looking at all of this the most

212
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,120
important question that you'll ever ask

213
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:34,660
is what is the data that I'm concerned

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,060
about for this particular thing that

215
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,339
we're trying to secure or what are we

216
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,630
trying to make sure it's private it'll

217
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,300
always go back to the base question of

218
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,640
what is the data and so anytime we're

219
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,910
looking at a system we look and say okay

220
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,980
what data are we trying to protect in in

221
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,780
what way in which way we secure it

222
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,000
things like that

223
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:05,439
so one of the things that's important to

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,190
understand is that in Europe data

225
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,150
privacy

226
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:14,380
has been a human right not just a right

227
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:18,880
but a human right since 1947 and in May

228
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:22,060
of 18 was when they had the when gdpr

229
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,990
rolled in and it wasn't exactly like

230
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,459
this but probably pretty close May of 18

231
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,980
you probably got about a dozen or more

232
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,040
things on your apps and said hey accept

233
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,930
my privacy policy well that's one of the

234
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,969
things that that came up in gdpr

235
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,199
and so there was a whole bunch people

236
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:49,290
getting probably annoyed at at what they

237
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:53,500
what they were seeing now the if you

238
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:57,310
harm people so to speak from a GDP our

239
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:00,220
standpoint the EU will level fines today

240
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,040
if you look at the fines things with

241
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,120
HIPPA probably in the the low

242
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:11,020
single-digit millions you in general

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,360
sued Google a few years ago for 2.7

244
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,600
billion dollars that's billion with the

245
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,110
me and they're probably still arguing

246
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,400
about that there was two issues recently

247
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:27,250
Marriott had a an issue with company

248
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,220
they've bought in 2014 called Starwood

249
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,420
brands they had a essentially a PCI

250
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:37,150
breach and Marriott was fined for not

251
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,089
doing good enough due diligence on their

252
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,640
acquisition and then British Airways had

253
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,290
a breach a little bit ago and they were

254
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,470
fined two hundred thirty million dollars

255
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,890
now both of those are are being argued

256
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:54,790
right now but fines in Europe can be up

257
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:57,760
to four percent of global revenue so

258
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:00,849
that's worldwide revenue no matter if

259
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,100
you have one person in the EU or your

260
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,610
whole company's base there and then

261
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,550
recently the Federal Trade Commission

262
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,420
find Facebook five billion dollars this

263
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,540
was around an issue with data in the

264
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,689
2016 election with Cambridge analytic oh

265
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,760
and I would presume that when when

266
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:26,950
pa goes into full swing in July of this

267
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,530
year that Facebook will have another

268
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,250
fine because California's gonna want

269
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,250
their money too

270
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,790
so anyway if we if we look at just a

271
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:44,290
couple of the highlights of GDP our and

272
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:47,079
CSPA we'll get to things like it's the

273
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,480
biggest privacy legislation ever one of

274
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:53,949
the things that is the most important

275
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,579
around GDP are is getting consent in the

276
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:59,319
u.s. when you sign up for something

277
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:03,040
typical is you see a check box that has

278
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,370
already checked for you what that is is

279
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,740
considered opt-out so I as somebody in

280
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,079
the US have to opt out of somebody doing

281
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,779
something so if you go back to that same

282
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,969
example with your with the flashlight

283
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,949
app you know you will have a thing and

284
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,510
says hey we've automatically checked all

285
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:23,319
the boxes for you you don't have to do

286
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:27,040
any work well in the EU it's just the

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,399
opposite the individual has to make an

288
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,819
an understanding and informed consent

289
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,860
that you will get their data okay they

290
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,380
have the ability to opt out of a

291
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,649
transaction now there are some things

292
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,920
where they can't so like for instance if

293
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:48,819
somebody has consented to give us their

294
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,260
data and they buy a vehicle well you

295
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:52,599
can't really opt out because we still

296
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,269
have to collect from you so there are

297
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,500
things where it doesn't work but they do

298
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,980
have the ability to opt out of

299
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,440
transactions and their shared liability

300
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,130
so when I say controller and processor

301
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,519
this may be you know for instance if

302
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:13,209
we're selling vehicles on behalf of Fiat

303
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,980
in in London they would be considered

304
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:18,670
the controller and I'm doing work on

305
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,949
their behalf and I can only do exactly

306
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,519
what they tell me anything that is

307
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:27,029
outside of that I can't do and then

308
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,699
there is strict breach notification and

309
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:33,910
this even includes if you inadvertently

310
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:38,019
delete data okay

311
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,790
the the notice here is 72 hours so 72

312
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,640
hours from the time that you find out

313
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:46,050
about a breach until you have to report

314
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,080
it and in the case where

315
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,620
again I'm selling cars for Fiat the

316
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,450
controller has to tell it was called the

317
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,339
ICO in Europe the Information

318
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,760
Commissioner's Office that there was a

319
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:03,839
breach so they have 72 hours so I

320
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,610
typically have 24 to 48 once you find

321
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,430
out about something to let them know and

322
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:12,240
there's been real confusion in Europe so

323
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:16,489
far on what actually constituted breach

324
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,230
so if somebody lost a laptop they may be

325
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,959
declaring a breach if somebody like

326
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,120
Marriott or British Airways you know

327
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,268
that's the classic breach so there's

328
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,600
still some still some issues around what

329
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:33,290
you actually have to report and how

330
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,550
there are more technical controls so

331
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,790
technical controls think security

332
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:42,149
controls they they have a function

333
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,910
called pseudo anonymous ation and I've

334
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:47,040
read this thing 25 times can't figure

335
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,100
out exactly why you would do it because

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,469
it's not as good as encrypting data so

337
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,130
everybody is essentially encrypting data

338
00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:00,300
and they threw some things in that are

339
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,430
interesting so you have to have a proven

340
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,369
mechanism for being able to restore data

341
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,470
you know inevitably people are very good

342
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,899
at backing up they push the button tape

343
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,870
spin they write it to disk and that's

344
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:17,490
all good they never restore it so in

345
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,958
order to avoid the hey I deleted data by

346
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,540
accident you have to be able to prove

347
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,020
you can get it back and then ultimately

348
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:29,428
companies will have to certify but there

349
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,720
is no mechanism today to certify so one

350
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,080
of the things that we've done in the

351
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,630
last two years is we've had a third

352
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,120
party come in and validate what we're

353
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,710
doing from a from a GDP our standpoint

354
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:47,219
to show exactly what we're doing so

355
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,350
let's move on quickly the the data

356
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,970
transfer piece is probably the biggest

357
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,590
in in this case and this is exactly how

358
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:59,670
Europe looks at it they look at US the

359
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,490
US as not adequate or not worthy

360
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:06,600
and in this case well it's in most cases

361
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:09,020
but in this case it is for the the laws

362
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,110
that we have governing data transfer and

363
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:16,950
in in almost all cases you want to make

364
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:20,520
sure that data stays within the European

365
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:24,090
Union or the EI which is the EU plus

366
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,389
three and so what we do is we maintain

367
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,320
what's called data sovereignty so we

368
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:34,080
make sure that data that is of European

369
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,500
individuals stays in Europe so it never

370
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:42,240
comes to the US the the own way that you

371
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:45,420
can legitimately and legally transfer

372
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,800
data outside of the EI is going to be

373
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,160
with something called privacy shield

374
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,409
that is done through the the US

375
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,390
government and so it's just a set of

376
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,520
standards that you have to adhere to and

377
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,560
that you have to attest to how you're

378
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,379
doing it but that is the only way that

379
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,419
you can legitimately move data outside

380
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,550
of the EU and then there's a couple

381
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,250
things here that that aren't as as big a

382
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,070
deal on moving data there are some ways

383
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:14,610
you can get out of it and these things

384
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,889
are either very very expensive or the

385
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,219
derogations it's like here's what my

386
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:22,380
excuses or for not doing it right and

387
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,870
that that's never gonna work and then

388
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,510
one of the things that is critically

389
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,899
important is understanding who my

390
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,790
vendors are and where that data goes to

391
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,000
what are they doing with the data so I

392
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:38,940
may sell cars for Fiat but that I may

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,520
have a third party supplier and I have

394
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,710
to manage what they're doing as well so

395
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,650
you can start to see how some of the

396
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,890
supply chain pieces fit in with each

397
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,770
other and and quite frankly what you

398
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,140
have to know about your downstream

399
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:58,920
suppliers starts to get very interesting

400
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,810
so if you take this back to you know at

401
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,290
the base we're trying to work on

402
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,419
security things we're trying to work on

403
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,129
privacy that are somewhat integrated you

404
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,650
have to start understanding how your

405
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:14,020
vendors are working so it actually ties

406
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,910
you more closely to the business

407
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,520
there are some things that you will have

408
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,210
to know things like right to be

409
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,260
forgotten

410
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:25,300
you have the ability in Europe to say I

411
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,770
don't want you to know about many more

412
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:32,620
now again this works fine for marketing

413
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,320
type information it doesn't work for

414
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,219
I've I bought something and I have a

415
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,919
financial transaction or obligation to a

416
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,680
company then you can't be forgotten but

417
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,660
there are things that that you can

418
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,120
forget and in there's been many cases

419
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,620
where people have asked us I don't want

420
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,659
you to send me emails anymore I don't

421
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,879
want you to come you don't want you to

422
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,820
call me we can take care for all those

423
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,620
things pretty easily and then we talked

424
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,889
a little bit about the breach

425
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,860
notification the one the one kind of

426
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:09,460
silver lining here is and this is the

427
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,199
incentive if your data is encrypted you

428
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,690
don't have to tell people if you had a

429
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,350
breach because theoretically it

430
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:20,970
shouldn't be readable okay but what gdpr

431
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,020
doesn't do is they don't stipulate

432
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,060
particular types of encryption

433
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,629
they just stipulate if it has to be

434
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,070
encrypted so you could get away with

435
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,350
with a lower strength encryption but

436
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,070
it's not worth doing if you don't do it

437
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,750
well and then there are we talked about

438
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,960
subcontractors there are special things

439
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:44,440
that you have to have in place so I have

440
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,740
to have contracts in place with any

441
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,930
vendor that touches data it's something

442
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,120
that you want to do and you normally

443
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:56,500
want to do but in this case you have to

444
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,510
do so just a real quick lesson on GPR

445
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,560
what it is what it does and we'll get

446
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:04,180
into some of the interesting things now

447
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,030
there has been some recent stuff in the

448
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,550
last few months Google actually won

449
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:14,649
something where they didn't have to get

450
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:16,440
rid of of data for someone okay now on

451
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,700
the flip side about the same time

452
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,540
Facebook was told they have to take out

453
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,880
content globally so you can see where

454
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,670
different parts of the EU are doing

455
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,780
different things so the EU as one

456
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:34,770
entity Germany can bring suit or Belgium

457
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,889
can bring suit on a particular piece

458
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:43,480
then there was a lawsuit recently Lloyd

459
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:46,720
vs Google where things like minimally

460
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,850
exposed items so an exposed email

461
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,330
address you could essentially have a

462
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,770
class-action lawsuit around that so it's

463
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,500
gonna be there's a lot of things

464
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,750
happening in the EU space same thing

465
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:03,090
will start to happen in California where

466
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:05,950
people who are very litigants will start

467
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,429
suing about any number of things and

468
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:13,170
this will be part of it you have to show

469
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:15,610
time to live so typically on cookies

470
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,860
cookies will live can be a session

471
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:20,740
cookie but there are cookies

472
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,870
particularly YouTube that will last

473
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,470
seven thousand nine hundred and eighty

474
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:29,439
years okay you're probably switching out

475
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,960
laptops before then but you know that

476
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,330
cookie will last that long and so you're

477
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,290
gonna have to to start showing that and

478
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:41,050
in the case where where we do will show

479
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,139
it and it may make people mad or

480
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:47,440
whatever but we have to anyway and then

481
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:50,940
in the EU there are two hundred thousand

482
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,700
websites right now that are at issue

483
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,200
because they use Google Analytics and

484
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,040
talking about site performance data

485
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,540
things like that there's gonna be big

486
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,190
lawsuits about that and I'll show you

487
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,540
here in a little bit some of the things

488
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:09,760
we're doing to to combat that one of the

489
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:13,120
interesting things is when you look at

490
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,840
it from a compliance standpoint right

491
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,979
now there's only nine percent of

492
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,610
companies that are fully compliant

493
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:24,340
there's a the rest of them are somewhere

494
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,040
in that I think a lot of people waited

495
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,159
kind of see what would happen you know

496
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,320
who would go first maybe the big

497
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,930
companies would would get hit first so

498
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,290
like the the Marriott's the world the

499
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:41,590
the British Airways not my company well

500
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:44,710
for where we are today we are in the

501
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,240
fully compliant status and for one of

502
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,240
our companies and then a company we

503
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,529
bought we are probably right on the line

504
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,179
for fully compliant and for what we know

505
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,240
but again because there's no way to

506
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:00,789
certify there's no real way to say yep I

507
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,950
have I have a piece paper that says I've

508
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,279
done everything I'm supposed to but it's

509
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:09,070
telling that even in in nineteen when

510
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,919
this was done and this was only done six

511
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,129
seven months ago finished that most

512
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,279
companies you know that's that 54

513
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,470
percent 55 percent are not compliant at

514
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:24,279
all so there are lots people are gonna

515
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:27,010
get fined in in at some point in time so

516
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,370
let's move out of Europe and move into

517
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:33,520
the US and we'll talk about California a

518
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:36,699
little bit what's interesting about

519
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,168
California is that all of the tech

520
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,419
companies in California really want a

521
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:47,590
uniform privacy law but they don't want

522
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:49,140
to go so far as gdpr has because there's

523
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:53,020
a lot of things that are just very

524
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,330
onerous on companies to do but there's a

525
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,149
number of articles like this that are

526
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,449
been coming out and some of the key

527
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:04,979
requirements for that it's really about

528
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:08,740
sixty to sixty-five percent of GDP are

529
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,679
you do have a right to deletion you have

530
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:16,539
to essentially add two components to a

531
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,940
website so an individual can complain or

532
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:22,240
object to you so in their personal data

533
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,700
if you do and they have the right to

534
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,419
know what data you hold on them

535
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,510
individually so if you don't sell data

536
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:35,110
you don't have to put a it's a seal or a

537
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,730
mark on your website okay and I'll show

538
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,168
you how we're handling some of that here

539
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,399
in a little bit

540
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:49,179
the fines will end up being being high

541
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:50,530
so if you think about 7,500 on what if

542
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,559
you have a million records in your

543
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,029
database and they're all in violation

544
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,749
the numbers get pretty big pretty quick

545
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:02,659
okay there are larger sets of data that

546
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:06,710
you have to worry about and you have to

547
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:09,980
know what data is sold so you can tell

548
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:13,039
your downstream providers a John Doe

549
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,769
said I can't sell their data so you

550
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,980
can't sell it either now the only the

551
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,299
only upside for a company is that

552
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,830
individuals must requests every 12

553
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:28,009
months but in practice as a company if

554
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,249
you delete somebody's information you're

555
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:33,039
not going to go back and recreate it so

556
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:36,230
these are the the key requirements and

557
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,210
that are kind of outside of what the the

558
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,139
gdpr

559
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:46,850
pieces are now from a one of the things

560
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:51,529
that is very big with in both GD PRN and

561
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,689
CCA is data mapping okay so there's

562
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:55,909
tools that are coming out to help with

563
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:00,740
data mapping but unfortunately right now

564
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:04,519
it is mostly manual so in in this case

565
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:08,210
these are various companies that I take

566
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,039
care for vendors across the top and then

567
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,279
the red lines are here's the data

568
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:15,110
elements that are that are personal or

569
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,419
sensitive and then there's some data

570
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,279
elements we send out that are you know

571
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:23,299
just vehicle information so not a big

572
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,450
deal but what's important is that you

573
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:28,908
have to understand the data flow so what

574
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:33,529
is internal internal what is internal to

575
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:36,470
external okay now this is remarkably

576
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:40,220
painful to do for every system that you

577
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,279
have and in fact in my company car is a

578
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,840
holding company and we take care for 17

579
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,509
separate lines of business that I'll

580
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,330
talk to each other

581
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:53,480
now we don't sell data so it's easier

582
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:57,080
for us to do but we have to map the data

583
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,639
out and quite frankly knowing what data

584
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,428
moves where gives you a huge benefit on

585
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:07,939
the security side so if I know what data

586
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:10,039
is moving where you know if I know that

587
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,219
this vendor I'm sending data to I'm only

588
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,959
sending vehicle data that is no way

589
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,359
shape or form

590
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:21,469
gonna harm me from a regulatory

591
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:24,978
standpoint you I have to secure that the

592
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:27,019
same way where I may be sending somebody

593
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:29,599
social security number so some things

594
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:34,459
that are critical to know that are very

595
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:37,789
helpful on the security side as you know

596
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:40,039
as you get into this more again going

597
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:42,829
back to what is the data that I care

598
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,829
about what is it traveling where is it

599
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:47,239
traveling to and quite frankly then how

600
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:50,029
do I break down

601
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:53,779
I want protecting that data on a regular

602
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:57,799
basis so data mapping while very very

603
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:59,359
painful is critical to do now there's

604
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,418
some stuff that's coming out this is

605
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:06,049
brand-new stuff enforcement on this

606
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:09,499
starts in in July the the law went

607
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:12,379
active beginning of the year and even

608
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:16,729
with all of the coronavirus stuff

609
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:19,728
they're still on track to launch this in

610
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:23,119
seven you know essentially July and then

611
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:26,659
there are employer provisions that come

612
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:29,658
into place beginning of next year there

613
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:33,109
are some new rules from the California

614
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:35,899
area general that came out in October

615
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:38,239
and so it really didn't give people time

616
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:42,139
to plan for them but we're in process of

617
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:43,940
doing that consent gets tougher one of

618
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:45,079
the things that you'll hear about is Do

619
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,429
Not Track

620
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:51,799
this was popular several years ago and

621
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,119
essentially telling you know a website

622
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,539
don't track what I'm doing

623
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:59,559
there's several browsers that will that

624
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:03,109
will help with this brave browser

625
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,019
Firefox has a good one and and so you

626
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,968
can do that but being able to manage do

627
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:10,429
not track if you look at this typically

628
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:13,999
a website will say yeah we don't honor

629
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:16,159
that but now you may have to and we're

630
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:19,429
expecting the final rules coming from

631
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,170
them here in in the next month or so

632
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,360
and

633
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:27,590
we expect that you will see the next

634
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,850
iteration of CCPA on the ballot in

635
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,340
November

636
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:35,360
getting even tougher than what they have

637
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:38,270
right now and you might say well yeah so

638
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,310
I won't do business in California except

639
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,400
California by itself is the fifth

640
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,340
largest economy in the world so if you

641
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,040
want to do business there you will abide

642
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,070
by these rules and quite frankly there's

643
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,889
some things that doing a combination and

644
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,770
we'll talk about this in a bit of gdpr

645
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:00,110
and CSPA can give you a competitive

646
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:05,030
advantage but one of the things that's

647
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:08,120
really starting to annoy or whatever but

648
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:11,360
that is around cookies cookies are

649
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,600
actually quite frankly a new cottage

650
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,350
industry it's amazing in most in the

651
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,639
u.s. it's not mandated yet but in Europe

652
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,360
there's a number of things that are

653
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,050
happening around cookies themselves that

654
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,959
are spawning a new set of products to be

655
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,510
able to to deal with them they're not

656
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,690
mandatory but twelve to eighteen months

657
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,310
I guarantee they will be and you know

658
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:42,140
most people don't have a way to

659
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:44,690
implement a cookie banner quite quite

660
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,030
frankly the ability to do in English but

661
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,180
then in 21 languages so one of my sites

662
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:55,129
in Brussels I have to do it in 21

663
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:57,470
languages and it's expensive to do from

664
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,320
just for a translation standpoint but

665
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:04,450
hard to do in general and then getting

666
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,010
in do not track things like can I do

667
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:10,220
implied consent understanding the

668
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,620
different things that make up cookies

669
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,720
and so when I talk about that what I

670
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,600
really mean is this cookie banner that

671
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,290
you will see okay typically you'll have

672
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,480
your text maybe what the settings are

673
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,820
most most cookie banners in the u.s.

674
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,410
today basically say you know we use

675
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:31,610
cookies thank you very much

676
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,920
look yes to continue we do things a

677
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,740
little

678
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,870
so all of our cookies are turned off

679
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,800
until there's a banner interaction so

680
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:43,310
you do something down here and then we

681
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,530
give the the user the ability to

682
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:51,240
understand how their cookies are set and

683
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:53,820
accept and then ultimately we force

684
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,350
interaction before somebody gets the

685
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,159
site so we're doing those things that

686
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:02,899
that you have to to be in regulatory

687
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:06,240
compliance again the the best way to

688
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:09,510
deal with getting fined is to not get

689
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,250
fine in the first place so this cookie

690
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,580
settings piece is interesting we

691
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:19,159
actually built this piece that shows

692
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:23,130
what cookies are in use very early in in

693
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:26,280
18 after gdpr what active and our

694
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,350
outside counsel made me do this and it's

695
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,050
proven to be good because now it's it's

696
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:34,889
coming into the forefront and we give

697
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,970
people the ability to they have control

698
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,149
okay

699
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:41,040
they can turn cookies on and off so if

700
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:43,319
you go to a site that deals with cookies

701
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,719
you can turn off targeting cookies and

702
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,960
those will be turned off as long as you

703
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,639
don't clear those forever and then we

704
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,449
give people the ability to come back and

705
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,270
change me at will and then right here

706
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,549
where it talks about the cookies used we

707
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,130
will add that time-to-live piece which

708
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:08,040
essentially can be from you know 10

709
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:10,620
seconds to 8,000 years so you have the

710
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,320
law in Europe you have a law in

711
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,779
California what about the federal

712
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,550
government well from a federal

713
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,770
standpoint there are a number of

714
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:26,070
senators and congresspeople that want to

715
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,370
establish a law and Ron Wyden out of

716
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:32,400
Oregon has been leading the charge the

717
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:35,940
real important piece here is they would

718
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,700
like to add criminal penalties so think

719
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,940
about that if you are if you are in the

720
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,390
security or privacy space and you don't

721
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,600
do something that the government thinks

722
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,420
you

723
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:52,560
should they will want to potentially put

724
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:56,070
you in jail okay so it's it's something

725
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,350
to keep in mind part of my job is to

726
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,180
make sure that the people that I work

727
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,529
for and the board that I work for

728
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,960
doesn't go to jail

729
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,130
so making sure that we are doing those

730
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,620
things from a security and privacy

731
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:12,510
standpoint that keep us out of headlines

732
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:15,870
so some of the things that we should

733
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,450
expect to see there will be the biggest

734
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,880
issue of all will be private right of

735
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:24,540
action so does an individual have the

736
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,460
ability to sue and as you can can

737
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:30,840
probably imagine most of the people on

738
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,210
the the Democrat side of the of Congress

739
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,460
want the ability for an individual to

740
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,190
sue most people on the Republican side

741
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,400
don't so this will be the probably the

742
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:45,150
single biggest issue and then the second

743
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,560
one will be don't mess with existing

744
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:52,890
laws like in California Congress will

745
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,810
eventually agree on something today they

746
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:58,290
can't agree that the Sun came up but

747
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,690
eventually they will and so I wouldn't

748
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:05,009
expect anything this year I wouldn't

749
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:08,070
expect anything next year maybe in in

750
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,870
twenty two so about the time that you

751
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,540
guys are out and working they will have

752
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:16,490
this and when there is a u.s. privacy

753
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,600
law it will be poorly poorly written

754
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:22,799
quickly implemented and there will be

755
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,690
lots of opportunity for jobs on this

756
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,760
stuff so it's something to keep an eye

757
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,840
on this will be something where people

758
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,250
don't have a lot of expertise and so

759
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,890
having expertise in the space will

760
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,990
basically I won't say guarantee but

761
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,839
it'll it'll ensure that there are jobs

762
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,000
available and then there are some things

763
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,480
where States will drive their own

764
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,360
interpretation you know dot 53 is the

765
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,650
the FISMA standard and it incorporates

766
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,430
privacy and essentially people will up

767
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,720
until the time there is a federal law

768
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,710
states will one-up each other I'm

769
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,529
expecting new

770
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,410
work to leapfrog what California is

771
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,470
doing so we're working to blend that and

772
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,420
before we get to that we have a you know

773
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:13,339
kind of the the timeline that I expect

774
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:18,060
this is my speculation so just personal

775
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:22,290
we sit right about here okay

776
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:25,619
I built this actually about this time

777
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,270
and I was right on brexit yay for me

778
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,430
we'll see what actually happens in the

779
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,830
year of practice ed but I expect that

780
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,899
federal will be out here but there's a

781
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:37,940
number of things happening between now

782
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:41,790
and probably 22 before that that works

783
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,190
so the companies that you're gonna go

784
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:49,230
work for I talked a little bit earlier

785
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:51,210
about as you look at at security of

786
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,790
privacy typically the last thing that's

787
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,849
put in as opposed to building it in from

788
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:00,750
the beginning if you turn that around

789
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:04,740
and utilize security and privacy as

790
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,730
driving factors as competitive advantage

791
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,839
tools that's where we're building

792
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,900
particularly our stuff in Europe right

793
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,630
now to where I can go to a vehicle

794
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,280
manufacturer and say yeah I do all the

795
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,010
security stuff you want let's talk about

796
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,760
that instead of waiting until the very

797
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:28,369
end okay so some of those things if you

798
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,369
look at it my

799
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:34,080
speculation but more than where I'm

800
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,660
driving people is let's look at this as

801
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,410
a blended approach I don't want to do

802
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,950
anything

803
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:43,040
I can't as an organization do something

804
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:46,680
separate in Europe and then separate in

805
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,140
California and Illinois and New York and

806
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,589
Florida so we're trying to blend them if

807
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,950
you look if you take if you do this

808
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,380
individually your homepage gonna look

809
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,810
like a ransom note with do not sell

810
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,010
buttons and what data has held buttons

811
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,270
and consent and cookie banners one of

812
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,510
the things that I talked about a little

813
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:13,550
bit earlier was Google and if you look

814
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:17,810
at this is the banner from my main site

815
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:20,790
we actually include right up front that

816
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:24,259
we use google analytics and that we do

817
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,460
not sell your data ok so instead of

818
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,040
building in a bunch of things that are

819
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,080
gonna look pretty ugly we get it to you

820
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,300
right at the beginning when you connect

821
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:38,910
the first time and this this helps us a

822
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,160
make the site cleaner but also gets it

823
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:44,759
right up front so nobody can say well I

824
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,009
I wasn't told now when I look at a

825
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,430
blended approach I'm looking at it

826
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:53,820
saying really in three parts let's do

827
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:56,190
the bulk of GDP our because that's gonna

828
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,290
help us with what California has to have

829
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:01,170
there will be some additional pieces

830
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,750
that I toss in for California and if I

831
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,660
include the security controls that are

832
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,520
within NY DFS around encryption and

833
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,359
around multi factor of things like that

834
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:16,140
if I do those three things together

835
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:19,260
chances are that whatever law comes up

836
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,560
from whatever state or other country I'm

837
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,260
gonna have the ability to adjust and not

838
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,960
rebuild so when you think about things

839
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,660
from a code standpoint the absolute most

840
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,720
expensive time to do anything is after

841
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,850
the fact so let's build it and right at

842
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,250
the beginning and some of those things

843
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,870
that we're looking at you know for

844
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,120
instance

845
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:45,690
these are all the things a subset of

846
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,970
things that you want to do for gdpr but

847
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:52,190
if you're doing them for gdpr and you

848
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:55,290
have a system in the US you do the same

849
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,600
diligence on that you're part way to

850
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,420
having all the CCPA stuff done as well

851
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,029
and so like you're gonna do data mapping

852
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,550
on both you're gonna do privacy notices

853
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:10,290
on both you'll add in links for the

854
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:12,660
sites okay there's ways to to take care

855
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,820
if we do not track one of the tools that

856
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,250
I use today is from a company called one

857
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,680
trust and they will autumn they actually

858
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:23,520
build my banners but it will wash also

859
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,290
help me with Do Not Track I have the

860
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,380
cookie banners and stuff like that

861
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:34,020
optional in the u.s. today but if you're

862
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:36,180
doing them for gdpr I mean you you're 90

863
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,120
percent of the way the way and then when

864
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,480
you add the the security pieces so you

865
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,310
add in some of the encryption pieces so

866
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,950
you know you're automatically doing

867
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:49,410
encryption at rest you add things like

868
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:52,379
key rotation and if you're doing stuff

869
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,799
in AWS they will manage key rotation for

870
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,490
you

871
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,620
most of the historic on-prem data

872
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:01,560
centers you were terrified of key

873
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:06,319
rotation well let Amazon manage that for

874
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:10,080
you adding in multi-factor everywhere as

875
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:12,780
a as an aside my my daughter goes to

876
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,279
Purdue and and she was all bent out of

877
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,130
shape I think was blackboard that

878
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,170
required to factor and I said at some

879
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,560
point this will protect you and now

880
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:24,540
she's doing two-factor on everything

881
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,940
anything that you're doing around PC

882
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,759
arcade and credit cards making sure that

883
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,820
it's somebody else's problem in order to

884
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,550
make a system level one PCI compliant

885
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:38,040
it's around 350 controls you have to get

886
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:41,040
audited against much better to outsource

887
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,410
this to somebody else adding in things

888
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,390
like web application firewalls in front

889
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,529
of what you're doing

890
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,930
logging everything you use these are all

891
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,660
the things that that you've learned over

892
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,430
time these are the right things to do

893
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,549
but quite frankly the

894
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:01,040
people don't end up doing so building

895
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:04,860
these things in give you the ability to

896
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,100
use these at competitive advantages as

897
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,570
opposed to you know being the security

898
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,460
guy that lives behind a door and they

899
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:15,120
slip Pete's under the under the door

900
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:20,040
we're so often okay so quick way to

901
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:25,170
build this I guess I can't say quick in

902
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,600
five easy steps if you blend these it

903
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,700
will help you avoid fines and quite

904
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,759
frankly give you a competitive advantage

905
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:37,470
as example one of the sites that we

906
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,970
prepped for CCPA we told them there's

907
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,819
four things you have to do on your

908
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:44,250
website to be quote unquote gdpr

909
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,020
compliant I said if you do them now you

910
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,210
don't have to do them in the future they

911
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,940
did all four and they said wait I can

912
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:53,370
take this and I can go sell this to my

913
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,890
customers that's the point you're

914
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:59,580
building in more security controls that

915
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:01,859
are easy to manage and we're doing it

916
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:05,009
upfront so giving that to customers

917
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:07,400
right up front secondly you will reduce

918
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:11,370
cost the more that you can build

919
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:14,180
security and privacy and early the less

920
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:16,830
that's going to cost over time okay and

921
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:20,910
things like having this is much easier

922
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:23,610
today with with AWS as your GCP to be

923
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:27,120
able to do automatic failover between

924
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:30,840
regions historically this was a holy

925
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:34,859
hassle to do between multiple data

926
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:38,570
centers getting things with scale okay

927
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:41,340
having the ability to again adjust

928
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:45,690
instead of rebuild is gonna help you

929
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,820
immensely okay and then reducing your

930
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:51,060
cost okay got that one twice that's

931
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:55,589
because it's so important so on the

932
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,839
personal side what does it mean okay as

933
00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:00,119
as you're going out looking for jobs

934
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:03,029
you're trying to figure out you know I I

935
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:07,009
want to be able to be good at a number

936
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:10,859
of things so I am employable okay and

937
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:14,069
one of the things I've done is taken the

938
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:16,558
used to do heavy infrastructure then I

939
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:19,288
did security now I do security and

940
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,420
privacy so it's making sure that I am

941
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:23,099
making myself the most valuable that I

942
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,940
can for my company

943
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:28,969
it will only from a job perspective

944
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,739
there will be more opportunities for you

945
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:34,229
on a personal level just understanding

946
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:35,670
what your rights are you may be one of

947
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:40,769
those people that wants to sue somebody

948
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:42,809
that is impacting your rights the new

949
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:46,140
and existing security privacy positions

950
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:48,509
will be around for a long time there

951
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:52,440
they're not going away and there will be

952
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:54,180
new roles okay as a privacy engineer how

953
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,019
do I build out cookies what am I looking

954
00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:01,469
for from protect people's data up to an

955
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:05,058
including data protection officer some

956
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:07,640
of the the certs that that David had had

957
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:10,410
rattled off I'm a data protection

958
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:14,719
officer in Europe just won't ever go

959
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:19,558
there so it is good for you personally

960
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:21,420
professionally to combine the security

961
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,180
work you're doing with some of the

962
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,160
privacy work and with that you don't

963
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:31,460
have to listen to me more because I'm

964
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,460
gonna go to QA if there is any questions

965
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:38,620
and David maybe you can help me with

966
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,620
questions here if I don't see them

967
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:45,430
you

968
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,660
David Jerry kept me with questions

969
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,660
thereafter Ani

970
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,540
you

971
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,569
Gerry you're on mute are you talking

972
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:09,950
there I am I just reminded everyone they

973
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:13,690
should unmute their mic if they had a

974
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,689
question just like I forgot to do

975
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,690
that question besides the you know who's

976
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:24,460
actually on a call or that the two

977
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,779
things I hear most often since I spend

978
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:31,930
about six hours day and zoom I'm going

979
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:33,130
to unmute everybody's mics so soon as I

980
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,808
do that if you don't have a question go

981
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:45,390
ahead and mute yourself so we don't get

982
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:45,390

989
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,910

990
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,310
background over here my name's Joe quota

991
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:24,500
and from General Motors I work on

992
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,390
embedded systems but in the embedded

993
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,260
systems I'm working on network intrusion

994
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,640
detection systems and I confer quite

995
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,870
frequently with our legal staff

996
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,640
regarding Piatt and PI so saw this on an

997
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,560
advertisement within the company decided

998
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,080
to pop in see what was going on I'm also

999
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,990
taking some CISSP classes working

1000
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,190
towards that over the course of a my

1001
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:49,279
guess is he's gonna be about another

1002
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:52,310

1006
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:04,400
that everything that you study for is

1007
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,500

1008

1009
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:12,320
background you will you will go through

vary

1014
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,150
objects in mirror may be larger than

1015
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:34,970
