of the x-reality Safety Initiative so

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,150
with further adieu let's welcome Harvey

32
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:53,210
can you hear me now excellent so I just

33
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,339
want to say I think I think maybe there

34
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,339
was a it was miss written I think it's

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,530
21 universities that have the CAE CEO

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,119
because the ones that have it might not

37
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,140
be happy if they see that in the video

38
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,149
like oh there's 21 thank you for for

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,530
inviting me thank you for having me come

40
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:16,040
out here I I gave a talk here when I was

41
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,410
a PhD student in 2008 if you want to

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,239
look that up of course somebody's

43
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,920
already looking things up as they're you

44
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,720
know coding or doing whatever they're

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,190
doing on the laptop there but I have

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,579
more interesting things to say if you

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,319
just want to give me a second and you

48
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,690
know I unlike other people I actually

49
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,578
got all my degrees here a lot of people

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,040
say that you get inbreeding if you stay

51
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,959
at the same University yeah I actually

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,000
totally enjoyed being at Purdue I think

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,000
it's a great school and you should all

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,720
be very happy that you made it here and

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,829
that you're part of the ecosystem of the

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,410
various colleges and their cybersecurity

57
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:54,290
initiatives so I just want to thank

58
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,720
everyone and I want to thank you know

59
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,459
gene Spafford who's done a wonderful job

60
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,650
bringing serious to the way it's at

61
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,450
today from back in the day and without

62
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,109
the support I've had here I wouldn't be

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,869
where I'm at so um today we're going to

64
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:11,030
be talking about immersive virtual

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,609
insanity is what I call it and it's

66
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,090
really about us exploring security

67
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:18,919
problems in virtual reality is anyone in

68
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,870
here ever used VR put your hand up if

69
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,690
you played with VR Brianne if you played

70
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,519
with a new oculus quest you wish nobody

71
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,230
well you should it's pretty awesome so

72
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm sure I'm assuming some of you might

73
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,880
have played with a vibe right vive the

74
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,560
vibe is pretty cool but there's a lot of

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,200
wires you need a computer and all that

76
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,190
stuff but with oculus quest for example

77
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,000
you don't need anything I'll talk about

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,950
that in a second but I think I would not

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,060
be doing justice to the two - some of

80
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,369
the things I'm going to talk about today

81
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,690
without my students these are all the

82
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,030
students that have helped me work on

83
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,340
this project and actually you know it's

84
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,200
really their their work that I'm

85
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,459
presenting so it's very important to

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,458
give them the credit that they deserve

87
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,090
and today I'm only presenting about VR

88
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,799
but if you go online you see some of our

89
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,600
research you know it spans all the way

90
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,630
from drawings to VR to blockchain

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,819
distributed storage child sexual abuse

92
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:19,399
material investigations and so on and so

93
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:22,099
forth but as any any academic would have

94
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,200
to this work was funded by the NSF under

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,870
this grant number so it's very important

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,909
for me to say that and it's also

97
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,000
important for me to say that my views do

98
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:35,390
not represent them as its as the claim

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,050
is presented here so yvr YVR security

100
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,210
YVR forensics look at the numbers the

101
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,080
market is expected to surpass 40 billion

102
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,239
by 2020 the systems are becoming more

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,310
mobile and would like the oculus quest

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,650
it's at $399 there's many untapped use

105
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,380
cases all the way from you from you know

106
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,770
it being used in the medical world to it

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,950
being used in social activities or

108
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,200
anything else that you might think of

109
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,599
and so far most of the research in this

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,120
domain has mostly focused on what on

111
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,300
developing experiences developing games

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,940
developing rehabilitation situations in

113
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,340
virtual reality and there's not really

114
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,740
enough research on looking at where we

115
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,630
stand in the cybersecurity domain in

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,610
virtual reality systems that are

117
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,219
actually that actually exist

118
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,470
so not theoretical research per se but

119
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,870
Applied Research you go and you buy this

120
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,280
piece of equipment is there anything in

121
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,680
there that we should be focusing our

122
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,510
attention to in terms of its potential

123
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,640
security vulnerabilities and if

124
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,610
something does happen can we potentially

125
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,229
get the evidence from it so the

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,250
interesting thing about VR is there are

127
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:52,909
some very interesting use cases right

128
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,100
this is a very bad use case right and it

129
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,910
also opens up research questions that

130
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,340
span the computer science domain so for

131
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,800
example if somebody was sexually

132
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,630
assaulted in virtual reality and they

133
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,950
were not physically sexually assaulted

134
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,449
so to speak what kind of things have to

135
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,779
happen legally there

136
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,599
in order for you to show in a sexual

137
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:21,289
assault case right so the interesting

138
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,259
there the interesting thing there is the

139
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,659
fact that the person immersed in the

140
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,219
virtual environment gets the same exact

141
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,099
feeling pretty much that they would in

142
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:33,110
the same in the physical world so you're

143
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,839
really affecting that person psychology

144
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,089
in the virtual world and it will have

145
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:42,229
impact on them so therefore it's a

146
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:44,240
problem but yet again there's another VR

147
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,960
sort of use case that would be very

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,180
helpful here because VR has also been

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,180
used in situational awareness to put

150
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,499
people in situations that are where

151
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,719
sexual assault might be happening around

152
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,999
them for them to explain to them how to

153
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,009
deal with the situation so there's some

154
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,099
positive use cases now there's some

155
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,889
negative use cases so what I'm gonna be

156
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,810
talking about today is going through the

157
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,779
research program and some of the things

158
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,839
that we did so the first thing is let's

159
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,270
focus on exploring the cyber forensics

160
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,339
of VR systems meaning that can we

161
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,909
extract any evidence from these VR

162
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,889
systems should something bad happen and

163
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:28,629
then let's look at the underlying tech

164
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,370
but focus our energy on immersive VR

165
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,139
because most people when they know VR

166
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,550
they think of like a mobile device that

167
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,419
they just put on their head and that's

168
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,979
it right but no VR is immersive you

169
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,568
could walk in their environment you can

170
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,529
move your hands in the environment and

171
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:48,169
that gets really interesting in our you

172
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,599
know our purpose was to go and develop

173
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,839
educational modules novel attacks tools

174
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,029
and other things in VR but ultimately is

175
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:02,479
to create some impact around this domain

176
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:04,279
that would be useful estimated twenty

177
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,370
seven billion dollar market worldwide

178
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,020
and that is expected to catapult over

179
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,099
two hundred and nine building billion

180
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,899
rather in just three years

181
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,580
let's go into the tech world where we're

182
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,069
finding everything from medical to

183
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,289
military to training applications to

184
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,689
home use for entertainment it's all

185
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,419
exploding while getting immersed in a

186
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,350
virtual world is kind of cool is it the

187
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,530
next target for

188
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:31,490
Sears WMUR 2 News mark Roper with what

189
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:33,589
it could mean for your family dr.

190
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,870
ibrahim beguiling gets to play in the

191
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,630
world of virtual reality as part of his

192
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,849
job but he suspects the trendy tech

193
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,490
isn't just the next frontier for gamers

194
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,290
virtual reality is absolutely

195
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,450
susceptible to hackers at this point in

196
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,459
time the doctor and his cyber forensic

197
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,220
research team at the University of New

198
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,420
Haven say they've uncovered

199
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,150
vulnerabilities in popular virtual

200
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,920
reality systems they believe the hacking

201
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,420
will be different from anything we've

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,520
seen before I think what's really

203
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,589
interesting in VR is for the first time

204
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,090
we have a technology that takes over

205
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,940
your complete sight and your complete

206
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,580
vision and now also slowly taking over

207
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,950
your hearing in the lab researchers were

208
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,500
able to take over systems and manipulate

209
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:18,140
users physically graduate research or

210
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,480
Peter Casey says one way is in something

211
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,390
called a chaperone attack a chaperone

212
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,120
attack is when we either disable or

213
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,189
expand the safety boundaries that are

214
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,050
keeping the player from moving into any

215
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,940
obstacles in the room in a human

216
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,130
joystick attack they were able to

217
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,920
gradually move people across a room

218
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,720
without them realizing it Casey says it

219
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,760
has to do with a false sense of reality

220
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,920
whoa this along with removal of

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,510
boundaries can be a concern you know you

222
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,939
could walk someone down the stairs the

223
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,760
group also could turn on cameras and can

224
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,100
insert or overlay images right into the

225
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,590
middle of an experience what that is is

226
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,660
effectively a ransomware attack where

227
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,560
they can no longer use the device as its

228
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,870
intended researchers say there are very

229
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,880
so as you can see our work has resulted

230
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,920
in us showing that there are actually

231
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,620
new kinds of attacks that could

232
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,719
potentially happen in VR and while while

233
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,300
maybe the technology in terms of the

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,550
attack vector might be still the same as

235
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,250
any other technology the impact is

236
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,140
different and we'll talk about this in a

237
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,390
second so you look at the different

238
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,340
threat categories when it comes to VR

239
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,740
and these are the sort of high level

240
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,750
threat categories that we focus on we

241
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,150
focus on input protection we focus on

242
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,160
data protection and we focus on output

243
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,779
protection we also focus on user inter

244
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,279
action protection when people are

245
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,500
interacting with each other and how you

246
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,420
can make that the data safe between them

247
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,519
as well as the protection of the device

248
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,990
itself so there's multiple layers of

249
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,220
protection that need to be involved

250
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,639
whenever you're dealing with virtual

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,129
reality systems and the current state is

252
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,540
that Security's not that great in these

253
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:02,670
systems and it needs to be improved so

254
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,399
what is most of the work that's been

255
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,160
done in this space what is it what is it

256
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,430
about well most of it has been things

257
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,829
that focus on you know items like input

258
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,810
sanitization right what do you mean but

259
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,209
what do I mean by that well if you look

260
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,709
at number two there you see complete

261
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,540
sanitization so if you have an input

262
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,810
from the external world that's going

263
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,939
into for example your XR vision goggles

264
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,619
or something like that you can just take

265
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,969
that out and remove it then the user

266
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,769
wouldn't have to see it if I'm looking

267
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,019
at you as a person and I can tell who

268
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:37,769
you are what if we change the person in

269
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:40,379
front of us to a skeleton right that way

270
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,329
I don't get to see very important

271
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,630
attributes about the individual that can

272
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,739
make me identify them just as an example

273
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,360
there's also been work that's been done

274
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,920
on data aggregation and output

275
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,329
protection and obviously VR exposure

276
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,810
therapy right if you're scared of

277
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,099
spiders

278
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:01,109
let's put you in a VR environment and

279
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,610
put you in you know give you some big

280
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,310
spiders that are gonna crawl around use

281
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,009
anyone done that now all right it's

282
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,290
pretty cool you should try all right but

283
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:13,439
until we started doing this work there

284
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,959
was no formal security analysis and

285
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,849
forensics of consumer-grade VR systems

286
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,069
and that's really where our contribution

287
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,509
kicks in but before I take you on that

288
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:22,920
journey let's talk about a couple of

289
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,389
like let's let's talk about some of the

290
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,240
our jargon some of you might know this

291
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:31,199
some of you might not any gamers in the

292
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,720
room yeah so you know what steam is all

293
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:36,420
right so steam is the primary

294
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,300
application at least at that time where

295
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,729
you would download VR games and use your

296
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,139
HTC vive with and all sorts of things so

297
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,339
you can think of it as the Play Store

298
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:49,800
for VR but at the same time it also acts

299
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,630
as an intermediary between the VR and

300
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,219
the equipment that you're using

301
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,320
okay and that's where steamvr comes in

302
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,670
so you have trackers at least with the

303
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,770
older systems and we'll talk about the

304
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,510
newer systems in a second where they're

305
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,699
mounted somewhere and they can track

306
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,319
your movement and you have the system on

307
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,870
it's connected to a computer that has

308
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,520
some sort of GPU capability that would

309
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,210
enable you to use the system's in the

310
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,329
first place

311
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,240
right so trackers light houses head

312
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,340
mounted displays and chaperone is the

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,890
fake wall you create in VR so you don't

314
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,570
hit the real wall if I had the headset

315
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,080
on me right now and I'm approaching a

316
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,460
wall I don't want to hit it right and

317
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,710
that's really the whole point of

318
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,120
creating that fake wall so you can see

319
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:38,840
it in VR so you don't hit the real wall

320
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,050
hello good morning how's it going man

321
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,120
doing well all right so that's your job

322
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,069
as an educator is to get people focused

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,650
right make sure that what you're saying

324
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,510
is kind of interesting now you have

325
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,810
inside-out tracking you don't need to

326
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,400
hang anything up you don't need to do

327
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,569
anything you just put the system on and

328
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:04,829
you go that's it right so ready player

329
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,810
now is real almost right and more

330
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,760
importantly the oculus quest was

331
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,660
released and about maybe a month or two

332
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,819
ago now they do hand tracking right so

333
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,339
they can do real-time hand tracking and

334
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,570
not just the you know the the joystick

335
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,250
tracking per se that you have in your

336
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,620
hands they can track your hands they can

337
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,690
track your fingers so now you can live a

338
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,960
VR experience where things are more

339
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,000
trackable right so from a privacy

340
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,400
perspective think about all the data

341
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,150
that's being collected as this is

342
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,010
happening so one of the first things we

343
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,530
wanted to do is to see what kind of

344
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,200
artifacts we can pull from these systems

345
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,150
in order to show for example if

346
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,970
something had happened and why it

347
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,290
happened so maybe a crime was committed

348
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,040
all right maybe you walked into a room

349
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,530
and I always tell people this if you

350
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,219
don't like your husband buy him a VR

351
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:01,920
system put them in VR and now they can't

352
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,499
see anything just go and whack them on

353
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,228
the back of the head right

354
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:08,789
so from me as a person as a

355
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:11,159
cybersecurity person I'm always looking

356
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,899
at all the attack vectors and I think

357
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,059
that VR is the perfect time to kill

358
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,009
somebody as crazy as that sounds now

359
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,299
hopefully that doesn't happen while this

360
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:20,459
is recording and it's gonna be playing

361
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:22,319
you know don't don't don't censor this

362
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,549
because I'm saying it you know but you

363
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,839
know hopefully no one's gonna take that

364
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,879
idea forward and then I'm gonna be

365
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,239
blamed for it but it's the perfect time

366
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,939
all right so what artifacts can you

367
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:35,039
create and we have a project that was

368
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:37,738
funded by DHS called the artifact Genome

369
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,239
Project that was launched in 2017 I'm

370
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:41,549
just going to show you a quick video so

371
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:43,789
that maybe you'd want to use it in the

372
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,789
future

373
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:48,868
Joan in London Joe in Switzerland and

374
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:50,609
Mark in the US are all digital forensic

375
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:52,679
practitioners struggling with the same

376
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:54,869
problem they have to rely on their own

377
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,728
past experience in manual digital

378
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,099
forensic analysis in order to find

379
00:15:56,729 --> 00:16:00,569
evidentiary artifacts and every device

380
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:02,669
they work with has different forensic

381
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,618
artifacts making their job that much

382
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:07,079
harder what if their knowledge was

383
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:10,069
gathered and what if these artifacts

384
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,649
could be tracked and updated over time

385
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,868
introducing a GP a unified digital

386
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,699
forensic curation platform that brings

387
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:24,569
forensic practitioners together like

388
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:26,998
never before investigating these are to

389
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:31,098
buy you subscribe to a GP and you can

390
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:33,659
gain access to that data so our job

391
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:35,549
initially was to look at the security

392
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,799
and forensic analysis and focusing more

393
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:40,079
on the application layer and seeing what

394
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,209
we can get at the network what we can

395
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,649
get in RAM and we can what we can get

396
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,589
from the disk and that was kind of our

397
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:49,799
initial sort of work so this was the

398
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,959
first paper we presented at at sad fee

399
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,509
which was at which was a workshop at

400
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,508
security and privacy and what we did is

401
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:59,639
we analysed all the social apps in the

402
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,699
VR market that we thought were highly

403
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,829
used so prior to this work a lot of my

404
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,029
work is focused on mobile apps so we did

405
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,480
forensic analysis of for example

406
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,609
whatsapp we did forensic analysis of you

407
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,740
know all of the social sort of messaging

408
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,008
applications as you say Facebook we did

409
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,359
Twitter we did all of them and my

410
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,679
mindset you know

411
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,299
as a research I'm like what's the next

412
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,709
thing how our people are gonna socialize

413
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,119
in the future right I mean we're all

414
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,199
stuck into it with our phones and

415
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,549
there's people in this room stuck to

416
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,470
their laptops right now all right that's

417
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,520
what we do we're screen people and all

418
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,679
we're doing is we're bringing the screen

419
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,500
closer to our eyes that's that's where

420
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,360
we're moving so essentially if you have

421
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,370
a VR system on you're gonna interact

422
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,620
with another person somewhere around the

423
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,360
world watch a movie with them go out on

424
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,330
a date right that's where we're heading

425
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,830
so that's what we did and we were the

426
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,570
first people to take a closer look at

427
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,580
them so we basically set up an

428
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,399
experiment where we set up two different

429
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,710
VR systems had the people log on to

430
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,570
these apps use them so that we can

431
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,360
generate some data and see where that

432
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,370
takes us so to give you a quick overview

433
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,100
these are just some of the artifacts

434
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,459
that we were able to recover right so we

435
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,129
can tell a lot of things and this is

436
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,840
just from the steam side of things which

437
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,860
is this app store that I was talking

438
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,860
about all right

439
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,980
we know when things when people logged

440
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,049
on we know when they're logged off we

441
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,660
have access to all this data potentially

442
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,220
from the system there's also an app

443
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,740
called big screen as anyone heard of big

444
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,210
screen right so big screen is this app

445
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,429
where you could basically watch a movie

446
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,410
with someone else around the world you

447
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,929
know if you want to watch Netflix with

448
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,940
somebody who's in New Zealand you can do

449
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,220
that right so that's kind of the idea

450
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,320
behind Netflix and we were able to

451
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,679
extract all sort of artifacts from there

452
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
there's also rec room you can see we

453
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,910
know when people fail to log in when

454
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,740
they open the application Facebook

455
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,559
spaces so one interesting thing about

456
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,890
Facebook spaces I'll tell you about it

457
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,450
later

458
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,100
cuz I don't want to say it on video but

459
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,360
I'll tell you know after the talk come

460
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,678
and talk to me and I'll tell you in

461
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,510
person

462
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,809
but we were able to extract artifacts

463
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,520
there but really the main findings is

464
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,500
that we're able to extract artifacts

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,030
which can tell us the who the when the

466
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,890
what and aware of when something

467
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,559
potentially could have happened in some

468
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,570
of these VR apps and that's good because

469
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,940
if you were resulted in something being

470
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,830
if some crime would have happened in VR

471
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,860
then we can kind of reconstruct the

472
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,210
events and be able to see what happened

473
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,580
and that's that's that's really amazing

474
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,230
I think the real cool thing is when we

475
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,520
started looking at the net flow the

476
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,260
network traffic we started realizing

477
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,370
that some of the stuff is unencrypted

478
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,309
and unauthenticated

479
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,590
right so from a hackers perspective you

480
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:47,649
get really excited and you're like mm

481
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,879
what can we do next right and this is

482
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,620
when we realized that there might be

483
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,510
some man-in-the-middle attacks that we

484
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,580
might be able to do on some of these

485
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,179
things and we kind of got excited about

486
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,980
that so our next paper was published in

487
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:02,830
IEEE Tripoli transactions on dependable

488
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,750
and secure computing and our goal here

489
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,059
was to understand a little bit more

490
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,520
about where we can attack at the VR

491
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,940
layer to potentially cause the most

492
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,129
damage

493
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,460
all right so looking at these diagrams

494
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,880
right now is it clear on the screen can

495
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,100
can everyone see it yep so if you were

496
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,580
an attacker where would you want to

497
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:30,639
attack at what layer would you want to

498
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:34,408
attack like the easiest sort of layer to

499
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,409
attack at where would it be

500
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:47,350
come on give it a shot you have one out

501
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:50,289
of four chances so try yep the device

502
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:54,699
drivers layer which is not in the hands

503
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:56,440
of the consumer well so that's a good

504
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,880
point it's a good layer to attack him

505
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,620
because because you might have much

506
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,630
larger coverage in terms of your attack

507
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,789
surface the only problem is if you ask

508
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,760
the consumer to install a driver there's

509
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:07,000
gonna be all sorts of warning at play

510
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,620
correct

511
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,990
yeah like did you ever try to install a

512
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,729
driver on a system that wasn't the

513
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,230
driver was modified or something he's

514
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,299
just gonna give you all sorts of error

515
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,640
messages right it's not really the best

516
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,408
place to the top it's the best place

517
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,049
attack in terms of attack coverage but

518
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:30,580
if you want to go quick and get your job

519
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:32,230
done where would you go so this is what

520
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,480
we attacked on we attacked on the open

521
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,700
VR layer for a multiple of reasons one

522
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,210
it's open so you can see the source code

523
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,480
right that's great for us too it

524
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,070
connects everything together right so if

525
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,139
we're able to do things there

526
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,178
that means it's gonna have also a large

527
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,668
attack surface an open VR was created so

528
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:53,590
that today you have HTC vive tomorrow

529
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:57,070
you have oculus the day after that you

530
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:01,209
have Joe schmo's VR system you could

531
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,939
still use it right so we were the first

532
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,500
to coin certain attacks like the

533
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,240
immersive attack the chaperone the

534
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,039
attack the overlay attack the

535
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,679
disorientation attack and so on and so

536
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,220
forth we're also the first to implement

537
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,590
a point you know a proof-of-concept

538
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,210
immersive attacks using open VR we

539
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,980
successfully implemented what we call

540
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,360
the human joystick attack which is kind

541
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,889
of the more interesting attack I think

542
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,168
out of all of this in my perspective

543
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,610
because I like that that tax that deal

544
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:30,250
with human nature and I think that's

545
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,719
that's very interesting and really our

546
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,129
goal was to get people to think to

547
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,570
catalyze a movement like you got to

548
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,709
think about this if you're gonna do VR

549
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,519
stuff you got to start thinking about

550
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,470
some of these things so how do we do

551
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,149
this this is kind of the overall sort of

552
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,610
high level hierarchy of how we did

553
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:47,289
things right we made an assumption and

554
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,939
which is a very easy assumption to make

555
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,559
right and this is where researchers

556
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,909
would argue it's not an easy some no

557
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,928
it's a pretty simple assumptions to me

558
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:57,340
your computer was hacked for me that's

559
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,779
an easy assumption to make because once

560
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,639
you understand how computers work you

561
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:03,730
know you can get into a system however I

562
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:05,740
will make this claim that after this

563
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,269
after this part of the paper

564
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,009
I'd like this paper that I'm presenting

565
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:11,139
very quickly high level on I'm gonna

566
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:12,700
show you some more work to show you that

567
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,580
we don't even need to compromise your

568
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,990
computer to do all of this right we

569
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,519
don't we can just use the underlying

570
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,950
problems in some of these applications

571
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,320
that lie on top of VR in order to gain

572
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,789
full access and do very funky things

573
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,559
with your system all right are we good

574
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,110
okay but in this scenario that I'm

575
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,389
presenting we assume that the person has

576
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,639
access to your camera so what can our

577
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:42,008
access to your system right so what kind

578
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:44,979
of things can you do well we're able to

579
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:46,419
turn on the front facing camera all

580
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,879
right so that's a violation of privacy

581
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,429
we're we're you know we can stream video

582
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:55,059
back to us as an attacker we can see

583
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:58,170
inside your room we can even turn on the

584
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:05,050
camera if it's disabled by the user

585
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:08,020
okay the second thing is I was driving

586
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,700
once and I was like man the coolest

587
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,350
thing to do is to just get rid of the

588
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,160
chaperone and have people you know hit a

589
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,679
hit a wall

590
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,420
right I mean maybe you don't think it's

591
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,680
cool but I think as an attacker person

592
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,430
I'm thinking wow that's kind of cool

593
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,810
like oddly enough I think we have

594
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,140
somebody in the audience that have

595
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,520
helped broke someone's hand if you are

596
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,780
maybe you can tell them the story later

597
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,970
not on purpose so there's a chaperone

598
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,030
attack so what if you can just make the

599
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,770
boundaries disappear right and that's

600
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:44,620
what we did well then things like this

601
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,850
happen right all right well what all of

602
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,439
you I'm going to assume that most of us

603
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,629
know what ransomware is at this point in

604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,400
time right so what if we can create a

605
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,460
new kind of ransomware that takes over

606
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,100
your goggles right just place an image

607
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,870
there have it stayed there you can't get

608
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,870
rid of it until you give us some money

609
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,729
right and it's possible right because of

610
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,639
how how these how the layered

611
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:11,230
infrastructure of open VR works you can

612
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,820
do things like that what if I don't have

613
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,950
to look into your room and just see in a

614
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,620
camera but I can actually stream back

615
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,690
every movement that you're making I mean

616
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,290
how much of a viola C Prize you know

617
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,390
privacy violation is that and this is

618
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,250
actually a real-time rendering of

619
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,160
software that my student wrote that's

620
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,730
doing exactly that

621
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,830
right so we can stream location of your

622
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:39,340
where your hands are where your headset

623
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,409
is that's let me think about that right

624
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:47,199
we can see in your room and we could see

625
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:49,500
exactly what you're doing all right so

626
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,880
now I want to the human joystick attack

627
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,850
the human joystick attack and I can show

628
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,980
you that video of this in a second it's

629
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,540
essentially this let me tell you let me

630
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,920
let me give you a background story of

631
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,060
how we even discovered this attack

632
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,230
because we discovered it by mistake

633
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,300
right at our university there was a

634
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,860
virtual reality symposium that had

635
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,780
nothing to do with security it was just

636
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,439
like hey Alice let's invite universities

637
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,560
to do some

638
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,140
we are cool work and they knew that we

639
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,389
were doing some work in VR and they

640
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,070
invited us so we're like what are we

641
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,840
gonna do show them how to hack your like

642
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,240
you know like well we're like okay

643
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,459
whatever let's just go so we set up and

644
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,270
as people were going you know through

645
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:34,000
trying all these experiences Peter who's

646
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,070
a former student in mine he you know he

647
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,600
put the experience on he just flashed

648
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,310
things in front of them because of some

649
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,449
of the attacks and like Oh see we just

650
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,909
took over your vision and things like

651
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,590
that and it was all script like you just

652
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,390
had a couple of I think it was like

653
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,709
either C programs of Python scripts I

654
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,030
don't remember they just did some of

655
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:55,240
these modifications real you know and do

656
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,830
a girl put put the VR headset on and he

657
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,510
just looked at me for a split second

658
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,179
he's like man what if I like changed

659
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,040
there there's their virtual Center and

660
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,920
he just like all he did was he you know

661
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,510
just changed the number ran it and we

662
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,940
just saw the girl go like this and like

663
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,610
hold on because she just really moved to

664
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,890
where we told her to move and he was

665
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,790
like well I'm like I don't believe you

666
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,110
let's try this again

667
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,580
all right just changed the number to

668
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,929
something else and then a minute like

669
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,580
not even a couple of seconds later she

670
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,560
went like this I mean like oh my god

671
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,480
like did we just discover something like

672
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,270
is it cool and they're like this is cool

673
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,880
and then of course he looked at me and

674
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,379
he's like okay this is cool and if any

675
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
of you have done any human subject

676
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,740
research or the automatic answer it's

677
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,540
like this is not cool because if that

678
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,610
amount of work I have to do with IRB and

679
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,110
to get students in at all but then I

680
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,250
told her I was like Peter you have to do

681
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,959
this because if we think this is a

682
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,670
really cool discovery and we have to

683
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,250
just keep pushing forward on this all

684
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,770
right so long story short these are some

685
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,900
results for you to kind of see certain

686
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,420
things at the bottom are different VR

687
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,520
games like longbows or Texas slingshot

688
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,800
surgeon simulator and guns and stories

689
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,379
at the bottom and this is if you think

690
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,550
of this as the room and you're looking

691
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:10,300
top from the top down that's the headset

692
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:13,450
data right so at the bottom is what they

693
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,659
thought they did versus at the top is

694
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:18,280
what they really did right at the bottom

695
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,680
they thought they stayed in that same

696
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,560
location playing that Longboat game but

697
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,770
in reality we were moving them to from

698
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,399
location a to

699
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:30,500
Kayson be alright so maybe most of

700
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,120
you're thinking you know what Abe it's

701
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,310
kind of cool not very interesting to me

702
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,770
it's super interesting because right now

703
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,510
we live in a world where we can control

704
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,910
people's thoughts by putting stuff on

705
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:44,240
social media right is the next iteration

706
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,600
of that us physically telling people

707
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,190
where they need to go and they go right

708
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,070
are we becoming so programmed as

709
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:57,920
individuals that we might end up there

710
00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:00,470
and maybe the hypothesis is true so this

711
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,940
is a quick video to show you that top so

712
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,120
you can kind of understand it a little

713
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,120
bit

714
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,090
so what we do is as you see men they say

715
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:50,100
as a virtual sensor and all we were

716
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:57,240
doing is we're slowly moving the virtual

717
00:29:50,100 --> 00:30:02,009
Center to a point of our light and what

718
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:05,000
do humans do they compensate and because

719
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,000
the compensate for that

720
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,730
the game that he's playing all he's

721
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:15,240
doing is he's standing and basically a

722
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,880
circular area and you have to you don't

723
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,640
need to move all you need to do is just

724
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:28,470
use your bow and arrow and fire it these

725
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:37,470
items are around and all of a sudden you

726
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:39,420
start seeing him move okay this is

727
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,810
available on our youtube channel if

728
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:46,620
you'd like to watch this later

729
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:49,679
please go ahead and do so but the attack

730
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,250
was pretty successful it was successful

731
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,590
across a range of games and it happened

732
00:30:53,250 --> 00:31:01,800
with most people being unaware of the

733
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:06,600
attack taking place okay what if we can

734
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:09,389
make you sick right now you're looking

735
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,980
at this and kind of look sickening just

736
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,200
looking at this but if you're in VR and

737
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:19,410
this is happening to you it doesn't feel

738
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:26,040
great okay maybe you'd fall and break

739
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:27,150
your hand all right so what's next well

740
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
why can't we put all of these things

741
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,230
together to create a more impactful

742
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,909
attack right what if we can compromise

743
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,590
your system maybe there's no need to and

744
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,510
we'll talk about this in a minute what

745
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,580
if we look into your room what if we can

746
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,010
remove your safety boundaries what if we

747
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,840
could move you wherever we want like

748
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,850
maybe a stairway block your vision

749
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,820
disoriented and having have you fall

750
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,620
down the stairs okay what if all of

751
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,389
these things are combined into a

752
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:56,310
mechanism that allowed us to do these

753
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,080
things just as an example right so from

754
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,530
a security practitioners standpoint it's

755
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,270
nice to find one thing but you always

756
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,910
have to find multiple things to create

757
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,760
the impact and then try to leverage them

758
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:13,320
in a way that's possible right

759
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:15,270
okay now this has led us remember the

760
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,860
man in the the man in the middle stuff

761
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,629
we talked about earlier we were like

762
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,729
okay some of the data was incorrect and

763
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,179
encrypted so this has led us to

764
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,710
you start working on this stuff and we

765
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:31,410
have a paper out right now that's being

766
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:33,179
that's under review but we leverage old

767
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,130
attacks in new technologies and we were

768
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,040
able to do things that would just like

769
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,320
be very interesting to most of you and

770
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,540
in specific we looked at the the big

771
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,950
screen application and of course

772
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,168
everything that we discovered was

773
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:52,470
reported to them and supposedly patched

774
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:53,370
hopefully but a lot of things are not as

775
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,290
great as they seem

776
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,090
let's just put it that way so over there

777
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,918
does anyone know what we're doing there

778
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,949
just as an example so this is the

779
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,110
application and you can join a room or

780
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,549
like a public room and then once you

781
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,168
join that public room again big screen

782
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,179
is this application when you sit down in

783
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:10,350
VR with other people you can watch a

784
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,660
movie you can do all sorts of other

785
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,689
things right does anyone know what

786
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,640
cross-site scripting is yeah this is

787
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,370
just a sample cross-site scripting

788
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,049
attack right we implemented it once and

789
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,760
it affected all the users on the system

790
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:27,629
think about that for a second

791
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,440
right that's pretty that's pretty gnarly

792
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:33,390
say the least so this was our primary

793
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,950
implementation of what's again I had

794
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,480
another activity once I was hanging out

795
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,010
I was like I want to create the first

796
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,240
man in the room attack I don't create a

797
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,740
man-in-the-middle attack it's called a

798
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,030
man in the room attack so we actually

799
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,400
have a man in the room attack which I'll

800
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,020
show you in a second and it's really us

801
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,390
trying to explore what kind of old

802
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,490
attacks might yield different results

803
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:54,140
okay so there's two layers to this that

804
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,400
we discovered the first one is

805
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,559
cross-site scripting attack that affects

806
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,830
multiple different people due to poor

807
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,240
sanitization on application developers

808
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,668
of the choices they make for a lack of a

809
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,730
better word so what are some of these

810
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:11,100
things what do they help us do well RCE

811
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:14,990
doesn't even know what an RC is it's an

812
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:17,909
RC e come on write remote code execution

813
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:20,129
if we can execute ly if you can remotely

814
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,419
execute code on a person system that's

815
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:26,219
pretty cool more importantly we

816
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,529
discovered something at a lower layer

817
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,168
with the unity platform which is what

818
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,639
most developers use to create games and

819
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,509
one of the big things we discovered is

820
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,149
the open link

821
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,840
function the unity to open link passing

822
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:43,270
it to URL if you pass it a URL it opens

823
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,690
up a web browser for a lack of a better

824
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:52,690
word right but if you pass it see users

825
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:56,500
it's open see users okay if you pass it

826
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,330
a URL slash exe guess what it does it

827
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,359
downloads the exe to the person's

828
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:04,330
computer right so when we reached out to

829
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,609
to unity they were really excited not

830
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:12,069
really they even said oh that's just the

831
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:13,900
feature and then before we release this

832
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,210
publicly and it went viral and all this

833
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,920
stuff they just changed their their

834
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,840
documentation on the website saying it

835
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,220
could also do this it was like yeah it's

836
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,340
still not great so we essentially

837
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,618
created the first botnet of V our users

838
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,930
by leveraging the weaknesses in a big

839
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:36,640
screen application we created a worm

840
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:44,368
that was as simple as this okay nothing

841
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:46,930
too crazy but it works alright

842
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,010
self-replicating does the job so what

843
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:51,100
are some of the things that we could do

844
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,359
well control infected big screen

845
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,210
applications from a command and control

846
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,020
server which I'll show you in a second

847
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,810
independently download and execute

848
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,940
payloads run any program do a remote

849
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,770
repple gain control over part of big

850
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,290
screen application discover private

851
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,570
rooms invisibly join discovered private

852
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,779
rooms receive victims screen sharing

853
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,270
audio microphone video persistently

854
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,700
eavesdrop on on them if they go to

855
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,410
another room we can send them a message

856
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,240
that looks really legit for them to

857
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,540
download the VR driver now we can

858
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,520
execute our VR Driver thing and stay in

859
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,470
their system forever I really wanted to

860
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,910
write hopefully they don't update and

861
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,060
uninstall and do all these things right

862
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,700
so a lot of a lot of very interesting

863
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:36,820
things happen when you discover things

864
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,390
like that of course we can change their

865
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,920
avatar do all these silly things as well

866
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,839
so once you map out their infrastructure

867
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,520
you start understanding okay here's some

868
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,100
here's how they're doing things and

869
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,310
there's things like getting the state of

870
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,310
the

871
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:53,680
like doing a slash room state you can

872
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,200
see the blacklisted users which is also

873
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,109
not good so we were able to discover

874
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,060
usernames of people that were playing

875
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,710
porn in public rooms and they were

876
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,540
banned for that reason but now we know

877
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,550
who those users are so that's not very

878
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:13,150
good that we shouldn't we shouldn't know

879
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:15,760
these things so the first thing that

880
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,680
happened was essentially reverse

881
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,200
engineering the signaling protocol

882
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,859
across this platform for us to totally

883
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,149
understand how things happen and then

884
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,880
once you understand that and you can

885
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,470
decrypt some of the messaging you get to

886
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,840
understand the protocol and how it works

887
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,700
it's not that difficult again it's just

888
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:39,610
programming its messaging its protocols

889
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,419
but the main thing here is while data is

890
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,610
encrypted

891
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,940
there was no authentication and in some

892
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:48,340
cases there was no encryption which is a

893
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,730
problem all right

894
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,200
even though that in their code of

895
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,180
conduct they said we have no way of

896
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,580
knowing what goes on inside because it's

897
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,609
a spirit appear and encrypted which

898
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:05,950
didn't seem to be the case from our

899
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:07,720
perspective at least and then we started

900
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,819
looking at the core application to see

901
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,089
if we can reverse-engineer it to do some

902
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,340
some interesting things so we were able

903
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,840
to dynamically load libraries without

904
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,440
because there was no integrity checking

905
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,060
of any sort on these and then we

906
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,980
developed a proof of concept by patching

907
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,049
those binaries and doing some

908
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,340
interesting things with them all right

909
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:32,200
and this is kind of what we did

910
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:34,720
so enable to create the man in the room

911
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,129
attack my vision when I was talking to

912
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,100
the students is I want to put this VR

913
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,680
headset on I want to be in the room with

914
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,380
three other people I want to see them

915
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,379
interact but I don't want them to see me

916
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,170
and I don't want them to hear me all

917
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:53,470
right so by patching the application all

918
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,810
we did was patching things that would

919
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,819
send data essentially to the servers and

920
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,710
we just stopped them from sending them

921
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,839
but we would we were able to receive the

922
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,440
data that we wanted to receive to do

923
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,910
the funky things that we wanted to do

924
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,819
alright so I think it's important for

925
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:14,009
you to just see this a little bit again

926
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:18,239
it's on YouTube but I'd like you to just

927
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:18,239
see some of the things in action

928
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,509
so again this again started as a bunch

929
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,960
of scripts that we did and it ended up

930
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,970
you know I spoke to to Martin Vanderjagt

931
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,190
who is visiting us from from the Czech

932
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:39,259
Republic in our lab I was like listen we

933
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,790
need to package this thing too into an

934
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,980
application that can do all of these

935
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,080
things and this is when things got

936
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,460
really interesting is having one script

937
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,380
that can do something small it's not as

938
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:57,470
impactful as packaging it's into an

939
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:59,930
entire application I'm gonna skip the

940
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,209
infection process and get to the meat of

941
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,930
the you can you can you can watch this

942
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:09,650
the infection process okay so over here

943
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:12,310
are the discovered you have the the

944
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,630
public rooms you can discover rooms and

945
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:18,620
then you can start eavesdropping on

946
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,210
rooms okay so what you do is you start

947
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,870
poisoning and when you poison

948
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,800
essentially what you do is what you

949
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,690
start some sort of a cross-site

950
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,720
scripting attack against either the room

951
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,610
name or the name of an individual that

952
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,140
could then join other rooms and then you

953
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,710
can create a self-replicating worm

954
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,710
because of it

955
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:52,699
so we showed the more difficult way of

956
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,920
getting through that process but it

957
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:57,769
could be just as easy as creating one

958
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:12,859
public room with a cross-site scripting

959
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:17,779
attack in it okay so in this case now

960
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:19,578
you can take that room and you can

961
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:22,519
automatically see the zombies in the

962
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,979
room and it gets very interesting

963
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:27,769
right like being able to stream their

964
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:30,259
computer screen in real time back to you

965
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:35,468
you have to keep in mind something very

966
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:40,549
important here the end user did nothing

967
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:42,829
the end user did absolutely nothing okay

968
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:44,989
all the end user did was being a good

969
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:47,029
person they logged into their big screen

970
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:49,789
app they put their VR headset on and

971
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:53,900
they were just doing things the normal

972
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:55,760
way they would do okay

973
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,480
so we could start chatting on other

974
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,480
people's behalf

975
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:11,970
we can make people admins if we really

976
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:18,450
wanted to we can toggle or audio we can

977
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:23,580
toggle video we can play very sound

978
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:25,560
effects if you really wanted to so to me

979
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,940
from someone my age group this was

980
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,190
really exciting because there reminded

981
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,680
me of something called sub 7 I believe

982
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,660
that sort of was called right sub 7 you

983
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,950
know we're talking about Greg now you

984
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,879
have no idea what I'm talking about

985
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:41,129
ok so when we were kids there was this

986
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,930
Trojan that we would share you know on

987
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,580
ICQ and things like that and then it

988
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,529
will allow you to open their you know

989
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,700
their their cd-rom drive and things like

990
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,230
that I mean this was like the music oh

991
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,160
this is the new version of that as we

992
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,160
are and I got excited

993
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,340
we just ran a command prompt they opened

994
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:11,730
up on their on their screen right you

995
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:13,200
can open up the folder there so you're

996
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,360
seeing like that's the attacker and

997
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,200
that's the that's basically the victim

998
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,200
right

999
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:27,240
you just download an exe on the computer

1000
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:27,240
and we just executed it

1001
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,540
then we could do something funky like

1002
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,069
this where within their UI they'd

1003
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,390
receive some sort of a message that

1004
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:42,308
seemed legit

1005
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,470
sorry additional fee our drivers

1006
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:54,880
required looks like it's part of the app

1007
00:43:44,470 --> 00:44:00,759
they would download it and write users

1008
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,390
out you get the you get ok so then we're

1009
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,049
like ok

1010
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,670
most most research or most attackers are

1011
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:08,319
not going to be focused on disk these

1012
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,359
days a lot of a lot of people are doing

1013
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,579
things in memory so it was very

1014
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:14,319
interesting for us to work on trying to

1015
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:17,470
get data out of memory so we could

1016
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,359
visualize potentially what artifacts we

1017
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,040
could retrieve from memory to understand

1018
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,069
the forensics of those situations right

1019
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,319
so that that was kind of our our take on

1020
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:28,119
this and with IOT devices you know your

1021
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,819
most of the time you're there using our

1022
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,980
o T's like real-time operating systems

1023
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,420
and most of the stuff is just going to

1024
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,780
be in memory as opposed to being on the

1025
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,770
disk

1026
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,930
so again we took some well-known

1027
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,730
scenarios we used VR we took memory

1028
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,980
dumps and then we started statically

1029
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:49,390
looking at where we could potentially

1030
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:51,250
find static data access points within

1031
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,900
the memory dump so we could know where

1032
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,670
we could pull data from essentially when

1033
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,619
we develop some sort of a module that we

1034
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,990
could use has anyone heard of volatility

1035
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:02,770
right so we developed a volatility

1036
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:04,808
plugin as part of this right so this was

1037
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,460
the first time people have ever like you

1038
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:08,319
started nobody's ever looked at memory

1039
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,200
forensics of VR right so that was kind

1040
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,640
of really cool and we did that so this

1041
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,020
is the volatility plug-in actually

1042
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:20,348
running right you give it a memory dump

1043
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:26,410
I'm assuming it's gonna run ok so you

1044
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:29,770
run it against it it it finds the its

1045
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:32,020
finds the PID for the VR monitor then it

1046
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:34,240
finds the data structures and then as

1047
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,740
soon as it does that it takes the

1048
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,078
controller the base station and

1049
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,169
everything else and it also plots it for

1050
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,069
you to kind of understand the last state

1051
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,170
that VR position was in in

1052
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:48,589
memory right so now we've actually

1053
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:50,180
visualized where the headset is where

1054
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:52,038
those hint like where the where the

1055
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,769
controllers are and also where the base

1056
00:45:52,039 --> 00:46:00,440
station is by just pulling data from RAM

1057
00:45:54,769 --> 00:46:02,629
all right and then we got into education

1058
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,640
so we actually have lectures and labs

1059
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,190
that are openly accessible if you want

1060
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,690
to reach out I can send you this data so

1061
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,459
these are just some of the lives so like

1062
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,920
disk forensics and artifact analysis of

1063
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:15,440
VR network traffic analysis of the our

1064
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,949
applications and memory forensics of VR

1065
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:23,449
systems we have some labs that and

1066
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:25,099
lastly while we are while we just you

1067
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:27,920
know all alike our purpose was to

1068
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:30,559
attempt to use VR and see the security

1069
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,739
weaknesses we actually created a game

1070
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:39,680
for people to play and VR to teach them

1071
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:41,869
about digital forensics the sound is a

1072
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,469
little low is there any way we could put

1073
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:44,469
it up a little bit

1074
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:50,160
so we collaborated with big engage

1075
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,479
platform and this is publicly available

1076
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,520
if you actually have a to the

1077
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,140
introduction to cyber forensics lecture

1078
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,759
from the University this is the first

1079
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:02,129
time you're in vice research and

1080
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:04,260
education right sure the audience

1081
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,300
understands that the lecture will not

1082
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,670
make you a certified digital forensics

1083
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,310
examiner by any means and this lecture

1084
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,470
is really just designed to provide a

1085
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,600
simple introductory level outline of

1086
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:19,830
what the digital forensics investigation

1087
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:22,230
process is our goal is to understand and

1088
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,810
define what cyber forensic science is

1089
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:27,210
perhaps some list of the basics of a

1090
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,279
cyber crime scene procedure understand

1091
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:32,130
what to do when a computer is on or off

1092
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,840
on its own something called simulated

1093
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,550
situated learning so we give them a

1094
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,080
lecture and then we throw them into a

1095
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,960
lab where they would have to back in tag

1096
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,730
a crime scene in a virtual reality case

1097
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,130
to help you practice what you have

1098
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,930
learned thank you and good luck so now

1099
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:48,420
we're situating them or putting them in

1100
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:50,819
the shoes of a real investigator so they

1101
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,260
can protect either you're here I missed

1102
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:58,530
the start of the CEO of this company

1103
00:47:52,260 --> 00:48:00,120
this guy sure knows security at one of

1104
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,370
our engineers is going to lead the

1105
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:05,220
blueprints for our new VR time machine

1106
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,870
goggles it's our flagship product if we

1107
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:10,379
lose those goggles will mean the end of

1108
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:12,600
King small technologies oh I better

1109
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,970
start mr. big business across the road

1110
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,549
he's the CEO of our main competitor big

1111
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,529
cars so what we did is we built this and

1112
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,600
then we wanted to test it and this is a

1113
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,670
paper that's been submitted literally

1114
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,470
like four days ago and the paper is

1115
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,770
called isn't my digital forensics

1116
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,390
professor better than virtual reality

1117
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:32,430
exploring VF learning in VR versus the

1118
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,140
physical world so we actually conducted

1119
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,149
a human subject study where we put them

1120
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,250
in VR and we also put another group

1121
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,080
that's not in VR and we tried to see if

1122
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,450
the same amount of learning happened by

1123
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,160
doing pretest and post-test and running

1124
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:46,080
some statistical analysis to see if it

1125
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,700
actually made a difference the

1126
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,020
interesting thing is there was no

1127
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,330
statistically significant difference

1128
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,310
between putting people in VR and putting

1129
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,720
people you know between people and VR

1130
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,970
and between people in the physical world

1131
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,230
so that's a really good indication at

1132
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,879
least initially for us

1133
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,010
be like maybe we should be using more

1134
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,619
like the oculus rift so you guys can

1135
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,670
wake up in your dorm room or in your

1136
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,900
apartment and you don't have to you know

1137
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,520
change your clothes and you just put

1138
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,050
that on I can do the same thing from my

1139
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,790
own butt that I was like let's do a

1140
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,010
lecture right so maybe we should be

1141
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,570
moving more in that direction because I

1142
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:18,300
think it's also more interesting than

1143
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:20,250
the way we do online education now where

1144
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,050
it's just basically using blackboard or

1145
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,060
other learning management systems and I

1146
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,850
think having more of an immersive

1147
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:30,029
environment to be in might create better

1148
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:32,450
learning opportunities for students so

1149
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:35,640
in conclusion we need security by design

1150
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,839
we need Atlanta this is a landscape for

1151
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,118
novel attacks that we need to

1152
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,830
continuously explore it might be the

1153
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,220
perfect way to control humans in the

1154
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,279
future

1155
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,049
and when I say xr-- by the way so so I

1156
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,869
don't know if anyone's heard the term XR

1157
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,580
XR means like V like VR it means

1158
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,800
augmented reality it means all of these

1159
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,000
things lump together is X right so X is

1160
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,700
the unknown we don't know what's gonna

1161
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,730
happen next right so what are the next

1162
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:02,029
steps right what are the next steps and

1163
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:04,500
this is why I co-founded an organization

1164
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:07,740
Kavya Perlman is actually the founder

1165
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,310
it's called the XR safety initiative if

1166
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:13,229
you go to XR x RS org in order for us to

1167
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:15,060
really start getting people to think

1168
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:17,250
about this problem and they released an

1169
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,020
XR data classification framework not too

1170
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,690
long ago again I'm just I'm the

1171
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,480
co-founder but she's the head honcho on

1172
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,890
this initiative and we hope that we can

1173
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,300
get more people to think about the

1174
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,710
problem and realize that it's something

1175
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,980
that we need to start looking at more

1176
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,660
closely as we do a lot more research

1177
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,940
into security and forensics affects our

1178
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,970
systems as any good academic would say

1179
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,950
this is my this is my reference list and

1180
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:43,419
thank you very much and I hope you

1181
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:48,149
enjoyed the talk

1182
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:51,579
I have a question basically through your

1183
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:53,529
opening the gates of Hell be cut the

1184
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:56,829
communication with the environment for

1185
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:59,680
everybody is just mostly by the senses

1186
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:02,109
that you have you look you see you're

1187
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,839
here you touch and you taste another

1188
00:51:02,109 --> 00:51:06,819
stuff but this one sometimes it's

1189
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,950
getting some people in the deeper state

1190
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:15,099
that's basically cutting off from the

1191
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:16,598
reality so I don't know in real getting

1192
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:17,740
really involved in this kind of thing

1193
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:20,260
you're gonna get to the level of

1194
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,598
hypnotism so we can program people their

1195
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:27,430
mind and then you decide around and then

1196
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,890
basically you had them before we had the

1197
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:31,720
drug we should control the mind now in

1198
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:35,549
combination with this kind of a system

1199
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,808
this is gonna be very dangerous and you

1200
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:39,910
can add to that the subliminal

1201
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:42,670
communication that you can have with

1202
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,379
this kind of system so basically this is

1203
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,839
gonna produce some kind of people even

1204
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,750
though a lot of people this looks like

1205
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:52,859
some kind of a game or entertainment

1206
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:55,359
it's gonna make it really dangerous so

1207
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,859
as I said what just listening I was kind

1208
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,940
of confused that if you have some kind

1209
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:00,009
of you should have some kind of a

1210
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,680
commission maybe genies out of the

1211
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:04,390
bottle but they have to have some kind

1212
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,000
of a commission to see for the sale of

1213
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:08,500
these products and basically development

1214
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,210
of this kind of system because it's

1215
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,119
playing with the mind of the people and

1216
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,279
that's I say very dangerous I don't know

1217
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,599
what you think about it so it's funny

1218
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:18,039
that you said that because there is a

1219
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,859
company and I forgot what they're called

1220
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:23,799
it's like called it's called VR drugs of

1221
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:25,509
are drugs so so the idea of are drugs or

1222
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:27,519
VR drugs or I forget what the company is

1223
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:29,980
called like their whole mission is can

1224
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,529
we create alternatives to drugs in

1225
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,329
virtual reality right can we stimulate

1226
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:36,670
and have the mind operate in a different

1227
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:38,609
way by placing people immersively in a

1228
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:40,930
different environment so there's already

1229
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:42,880
companies that are coming out and saying

1230
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,210
we want to use virtual reality as a new

1231
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,950
type of drug solution for people and I

1232
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,329
think that's it you know again it's

1233
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,279
interesting that you bring that up I

1234
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:53,019
think the thing that worries me is like

1235
00:52:51,279 --> 00:52:54,880
any other technology there's positives

1236
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,939
and negatives and what we have to be

1237
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,190
aware of is

1238
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,810
applications of the deep privacy

1239
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,820
violations that can happen with VR

1240
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,440
because it's no longer just a cellphone

1241
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,120
that you're carrying so with a cell

1242
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,660
phone you can approximate the person's

1243
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,680
GPS location right but with a VR system

1244
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,470
you're in their house

1245
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,750
right I know that this is a wall like

1246
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:16,730
the VR system knows that there's a wall

1247
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,500
there the VR system can approximate

1248
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,900
where the floor is so we're getting to

1249
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,300
the point where our devices can see

1250
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:26,390
inside of our house and we're getting to

1251
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,040
the point where again the screen is

1252
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,779
getting closer and closer to our eyes

1253
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,980
right because right now it's a cell

1254
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,810
phone you can pull it out and look at it

1255
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,370
and we all do that right but in the

1256
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,830
future you're just gonna wear some

1257
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:38,299
augmented reality system that you're

1258
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:42,140
gonna augment the world around you with

1259
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:45,410
other things so to speak right so the

1260
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:47,960
solution I think is we do need some sort

1261
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:50,450
of a regulatory process for some of

1262
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,160
these things as they're happening and I

1263
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,560
think that the technology has moved

1264
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,200
really quickly to the point where it's

1265
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,790
become mobile and it's just gonna keep

1266
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,040
getting smaller and better in my opinion

1267
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,240
as we move forward and with the

1268
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,820
advancement in machine learning

1269
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,720
especially a lot of a lot of the systems

1270
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,820
don't need to have the same

1271
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,339
computational power to potentially

1272
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,710
produce the same results as like a very

1273
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,050
expensive system would so machine

1274
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,180
learning is being used heavily in VR

1275
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,940
systems these days in order to make

1276
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:23,089
things just appear better for the user

1277
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,680
and I think that that that there's gonna

1278
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:27,260
be more things that we're gonna see but

1279
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,210
then that brings up safety initiatives

1280
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,250
for a machine learning and AI which is

1281
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:34,280
another discussion obviously that we can

1282
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:36,890
have I mean

1283
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,420
basically if you continue you're gonna

1284
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,819
have you're playing with somebody's

1285
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,680
psyche right it's gonna be tough to see

1286
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,230
what its gonna be the fingerprints and

1287
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:48,230
stuff particularly if something happens

1288
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:50,000
and basically it's gonna destroy your

1289
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,250
mind and that's key that's a very

1290
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,080
dangerous thing because you don't know

1291
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,790
what the people are being controlled or

1292
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,460
not or what's gonna happen next so

1293
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,990
that's what point yes I think like I

1294
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,150
said I think we need a better regulatory

1295
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:04,609
process for some of these things as

1296
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:07,520
they're starting to emerge that's that's

1297
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:08,940
kind of the best way to do it yes if

1298
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,880
there was like

1299
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,589
a safer version of the video game

1300
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,630
technology where someone could like sit

1301
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:18,239
down physically in a chair and interact

1302
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:24,210
with like a physical system like a

1303
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:25,559
monitor so are you saying that I was

1304
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,210
making a joke I was saying only

1305
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,859
physically sitting down at a computer

1306
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,809
would be a lot so I mean you're singing

1307
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:33,029
a joke but I'm not actually I'm not

1308
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:34,499
lying because my mind took me to to the

1309
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,869
new sort of hololens

1310
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:38,368
and in some of the VR systems that are

1311
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,960
being used basically they're saying

1312
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:42,509
that's what's gonna happen in the future

1313
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,819
you're gonna have a lame desk that when

1314
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:47,519
you look at it's not gonna be lame in VR

1315
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:49,799
right because you can touch the physical

1316
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,839
desk and then you could augment whatever

1317
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:53,999
you want on top of it right because the

1318
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,769
new VR so so I mean I you know how my

1319
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:58,410
mind took me to like where we really are

1320
00:55:55,769 --> 00:56:00,598
going right so it's funny but it's also

1321
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:03,029
like realistic right I mean I think I

1322
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,349
think and it's actually as soon as I

1323
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:06,269
started playing with VR I'm like this

1324
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:08,160
would be a perfect way for me to change

1325
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:09,779
what my room looks like every other day

1326
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,640
because I don't want to get bored

1327
00:56:09,779 --> 00:56:14,130
looking at the same thing right

1328
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,328
if you have I don't know your augment

1329
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,069
things like if I have a student that

1330
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:18,809
really bothers me in the classroom I

1331
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:21,329
just like change them into another

1332
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:23,489
student I'm not saying I'm gonna do that

1333
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:24,900
just saying like maybe you'd want to go

1334
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:26,759
down that route maybe right now you're

1335
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,200
really annoyed by eight because he kept

1336
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:30,089
on bothering you cuz you were on your

1337
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,029
lap I was like just shut a bar I don't

1338
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:35,729
want to see him right so I think I

1339
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:38,609
honestly think that there's going to be

1340
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:41,308
tremendous opportunities in VR and AR in

1341
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:44,009
the future but I think that we need to

1342
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:47,819
thread lightly because it's gonna open a

1343
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:49,920
whole new avenue of security work I mean

1344
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:51,719
it's great for us right security people

1345
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,239
like we're oh this is great like it'll

1346
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,160
study the security of this with the same

1347
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,670
token I feel the same way about AI in

1348
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,469
machine learning

1349
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,969
there was like let's machine learning

1350
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:01,680
this let's do this let's do that it was

1351
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:04,410
like oh now it's like we have all these

1352
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,848
other layers of security that we have to

1353
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:07,920
worry about security and forensics that

1354
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:10,349
we have to worry about so it's just one

1355
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,029
of those items that new technology

1356
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:19,579
school but we'd have to step back and

1357
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:19,579
understand what we're really doing yes

1358
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:31,690
they were asking your attorney I'm sorry

1359
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,119
so I wonder Li how hard it is to get a

1360
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,609
memory dumps from these VR devices is

1361
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:38,799
there a unified interface or protocol

1362
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:40,690
for you to do this so the ones we worked

1363
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,220
on we're running on Windows so we were

1364
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,749
just dumping memory on the Windows

1365
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,169
system so that was easy

1366
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:49,058
okay but the newer ones are Android

1367
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,220
based so as long as you figure out a way

1368
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:52,470
to dump memory from an Android phone or

1369
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,689
Android device

1370
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:58,749
there might be a way of doing that right

1371
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:01,599
okay so there I think I think the oculus

1372
00:57:58,749 --> 00:58:04,269
quest uses a Snapdragon and probably has

1373
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,059
an Android and Android operating system

1374
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:09,788
running on it so I assume me to require

1375
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:14,650
some rude permission to do this like so

1376
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:17,440
I yes it's not impossible as we all know

1377
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:19,180
right okay sometimes it is harder and

1378
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,279
sometimes it takes a couple of years for

1379
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,410
an exploit to come out yeah but

1380
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:24,940
ultimately you know like especially with

1381
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,489
the iPhones right now I mean you saw the

1382
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,079
I'm sure you've heard about what does it

1383
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:30,819
call check ro yeah yeah it's like

1384
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:32,289
everyone like all the forensic companies

1385
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:34,390
integrated check route like one week

1386
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:36,910
after it came out you're gonna take an

1387
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:40,269
iPhone dump its data and you're ready to

1388
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:43,269
go there hasn't been enough work I would

1389
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:45,758
say in the memory forensics domain of

1390
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:48,279
mobile devices a lot of the stuff has

1391
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:51,279
been more on like Linux UNIX and Windows

1392
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:56,980
there's not enough memory forensics work

1393
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:59,470
on mobile devices so I see thank you

1394
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,799
well the ARM architecture is not very

1395
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:05,649
well studied in that regard to missing

1396
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:10,440
any other questions anyone enjoyed the

1397
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:13,630
talk also good all right thank you

1398
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,630
[Applause]

1399
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,640
you
