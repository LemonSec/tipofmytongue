public sector with Integra security and

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,390
some tips on building a successful

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,720
career whether it's in the cyber space

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,220
or otherwise so a little bit about

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,810
myself um

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,830
I graduated from Bradley University in

36
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,770
1984 with a degree in computer

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,360
information systems that was in the

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,100
department of computer science there

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,979
were kind of two paths you could take

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,160
you can go down the course es path then

41
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:54,940
essentially wind up with a math minor or

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,520
you could get go down course es courses

43
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,220
and wind up with a business minor so I

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,729
took the business minor path after that

45
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,840
I wound up at Andersen consulting out of

46
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:12,160
college which turned into Accenture

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,440
spent 12 plus years there in before

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,370
there was a security practice doing

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,720
Network Solutions and then moved into

50
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,450
the security practice and then

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,609
eventually ran and managed business

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,600
alliances with for the security practice

53
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:31,780
for or for Accenture after that I went

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,959
to what became Bank of America dot was

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,330
IBM ro North America which is a Dutch

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,790
bank which owned will Sal Bank locally

57
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,790
ah being the program manager for the

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,179
what was is basically the security

59
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,420
practice I forget the acronym we used

60
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,250
then that was Messiah was acquired by

61
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,660
Bank of America and had numerous roles

62
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,890

um I sue I left Accenture in 2005 oh so

115
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,960

116
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,930
over there since then and is growing a

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,719

120
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,110
the internal security team

121
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:19,580
okay coincidentally actually I worked

122
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,770
for CIO well for an internal project

123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,080
where the HR was acquired with worked on

124
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,820

they they're just bashful there's a

129
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,469
there's a few that I recognize that or

130
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,100
that are on the call but Lola all right

131
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,680
fair enough

132
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,600
well I just want to get a sense for who

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,460
was on if we were in the room I'd go

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,500
around and ask folks they reduced

135
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,450
yourself just kind of understand who's

136
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,920
there what your interest in so if

137
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,099
there's anything that I particularly

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,610
Taylor about what I have to say that I

139
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:14,930
can do so so I'll go ahead and and jump

140
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:19,400
in so a little bit about Chicago as an

141
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:22,970
organization so um the city itself is

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,049
home to over 2.7 million residents and

143
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,060
then kind of how Chicago's broken down

144
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,000
Chicago is big on neighborhoods so we've

145
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,340
got over a hundred neighborhoods so

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,560
people in Chicago kind of identify with

147
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,479
where they live and so you people will

148
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,730
ask oh well we're you oh you live in the

149
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,320
city oh you live in Chicago where

150
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,570
scattered you live you know in the city

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,290
my really in Chicago or do you just live

152
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,530
in a suburb so you know folks that if

153
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,030
you if you grew up in Chicago yeah

154
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,739
whether you grew up in Schaumburg or

155
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,390
somewhere else so but in the city people

156
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,270
identify great deal with their

157
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,760
neighborhood for example um I live in

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,609
Lakeview one of the interesting facts

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,900
and I'll touch upon this later is that

160
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,240
in order to work for the city of Chicago

161
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,510
you have to live in the city of Chicago

162
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,970
so if you definitely have that community

163
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,909
spirit of the folks that are working for

164
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,500
the city and then in terms of the

165
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,810
broader urban area it's the third

166
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,060
largest urban area to sit in the country

167
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,280
Chicago is also currently the third

168
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,240
largest city I say currently because

169
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:38,598
Houston is uh is fighting a great deal

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,120
to take over a third place um and you

171
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,760
know I argue that they've got a bit of

172
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,040
urban sprawl there but you know we'll

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,720
we'll do our best to hold our own and

174
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,790
then some things about Chicago as a as a

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,750
company as a corporate entity as an

176
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,829
organization so the city in terms of the

177
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,980
services we provide

178
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,380
five is made up of the city core and a

179
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,110
number of what we call sister agencies

180
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,270
so when you look at what my purview is

181
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,780
from an information security standpoint

182
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,210
is the city core so we have sister

183
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,209
agencies that cover public schools that

184
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,240
cover transportation to cover our parks

185
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,340
and our department our apartment

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,570
building so there's some other groups

187
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:30,110
that are outside of what I have purview

188
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,820
over from a security perspective but

189
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,720
that leaves a lot in the court it leaves

190
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,860
Public Safety it leaves

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,960
Department of Water Management it leaves

192
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,150
Aviation and a number of other

193
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,270
departments there's about 40 departments

194
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,120
overall so that you know there's there's

195
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,030
a there's a lot of lot of information

196
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,700
there you've got over 35,000 employees

197
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:56,329
you've got over 12 thousand vehicles

198
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,650
you've got over 500 buildings Department

199
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,470
of Aviation is the busiest airport by

200
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:06,100
number of flights which I know they go

201
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,890
back and forth with Atlanta in terms of

202
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,200
passengers Atlanta it seems to always

203
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:17,020
eat out on top there in terms of

204
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,460
passengers um but over 105 million

205
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,170
passengers went through the two airports

206
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,380
in Chicago you've got over here and

207
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,050
you've got Midway then you've got

208
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,400
another interesting fact interesting

209
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,449
Department is a Department of Water

210
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,970
Management serves over almost five and a

211
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,020
half million customers 225

212
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,100
municipalities and provides water to

213
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:46,430
almost half of the state of Illinois

214
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,310
producing over 750 million gallons of

215
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,079
water a day water per day and between

216
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:56,329
our two water filtration plants we've

217
00:10:51,080 --> 00:11:00,320
got capacity to produce and distribute 2

218
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:03,260
billion gallons of water a day so it our

219
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,540
primary water treatment facility is the

220
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,569
largest water treatment water filtration

221
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:12,139
plant in the world so you've got a lot

222
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,060
of things going on that are very diverse

223
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,720
one of the things one of the comparisons

224
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:22,010
I'd like to make today is like in one of

225
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,420
my first week or two on the job I spent

226
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:29,389
the morning at our water management

227
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,870
department understanding their business

228
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,980
requirements and then in the afternoon

229
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,440
completely different end of the spectrum

230
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,880
spent the afternoon with our Department

231
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,680
of Public Health and understanding what

232
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,260
their business requirements are so

233
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,060
you've got a wide variety of different

234
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,380
businesses that come together to form

235
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,138
services that we provide to our

236
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,240
constituents so it's understanding those

237
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,550
unique business needs and what security

238
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,410
means for each of those groups and being

239
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,260
able to provide services that meet the

240
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,230
needs of those groups so that's just a

241
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,199
little bit about Chicago what I want to

242
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,290
cover is rewards and challenges of

243
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:11,510
working in the public sector the public

244
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:13,219
sector is has some things that make it

245
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,459
different from working in the private

246
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,060
sector private sector being companies

247
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:22,029
that are out there a public sector I

248
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,560
don't think a lot of people think about

249
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:29,329
public sector maybe first in terms of

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,069
career opportunities and I want to

251
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:36,910
change that a little bit so what I want

252
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:40,099
to talk about today is applying cyber to

253
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,990
the public sector to your municipalities

254
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,260
to your state government I won't touch

255
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,569
on federal as I don't have much

256
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,079
experience there but I work very closely

257
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:54,800
with our state CSO and as well as our

258
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:58,939
accounting C so so understanding the

259
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,410
problems that are somewhat unique to the

260
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:06,170
public sector and how it they also

261
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:12,170
provide opportunities that that are

262
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:15,010
there as well so in terms of challenges

263
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:20,029
I think it's fair it's not saying

264
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:23,209
something to out in out or extreme that

265
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,520
in the government space funding is

266
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:28,520
always a challenge um we

267
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,540
are dependent upon taxpayer dollars to

268
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,640
produce the services that we deploy and

269
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:40,370
you know as a taxpayer myself you know I

270
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,899
want my taxes to be reasonable so the

271
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,540
other thing is you know you're very

272
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:49,490
conscious of each dollar that you're

273
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,230
spending is a taxpayer dollar so how

274
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,140
does that translate to what you can

275
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:58,339
deliver from a cyber perspective that

276
00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:00,500
means that to you you need to be

277
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:04,730
cautious and careful about the controls

278
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,310
that you are deploying we follow the

279
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,560
NIST model and work with the

280
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,959
cybersecurity framework in terms of the

281
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,959
services that we define and that we're

282
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:18,229
offering to the rest of the organization

283
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:22,609
you know since we are a public entity

284
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:27,350
and NIST is um at least for the United

285
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:30,740
States is the primary governmental kind

286
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:35,480
of standards body it obviously makes

287
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:39,380
sense to adhere to and follow NIST

288
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,930
whether that be the 853 series of 800-53

289
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,970
series of controls or the Cypress and/or

290
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,529
the cybersecurity framework those are

291
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,770
the things that we are modeling our

292
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:54,410
program after and building controls off

293
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:57,439
of but you know following that that

294
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,600
thread there a little bit when it comes

295
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,279
to funding you know that that that

296
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:07,040
challenge goes through to our salaries

297
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,130
that you're able to to offer in some

298
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,199
cases it's very challenging to be

299
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,850
competitive with the private sector in

300
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,980
terms of salaries and things such as

301
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,720
travel and training can get scrutinized

302
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,760
it's scrutinized on the private sector

303
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,100
I've spent time there as well for the

304
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,279
majority of my career but you know it

305
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,640
does get a very close eye in the public

306
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,839
sector as really it should because again

307
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,790
you're spending taxpayer dollars so arm

308
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,260
being able to work within those

309
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,740
constraints and being

310
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,080
able to develop services and

311
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,380
capabilities to deliver to the rest of

312
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,300
the organization to protect the assets

313
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:56,870
to protect your data to protect your

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:59,900
systems becomes critical so that's that

315
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,260
that's one challenge that you see a

316
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,930
great deal the next challenge

317
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,470
that that I want to speak about is

318
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,300
around transparency so in the government

319
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,240
space there's a concept called the

320
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:20,420
Freedom of Freedom of Information Act or

321
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:24,400
FOIA what this is is legislation at the

322
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,229
state level that says that the

323
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,310
information that you produce really

324
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:34,100
isn't yours it's the taxpayers so at a

325
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,319
private organization at a corporation if

326
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,060
somebody were to walk up to you and say

327
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,370
hey I want to know about XYZ about your

328
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,989
security program you probably tell them

329
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,640
to take a hike but in the public sector

330
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:55,910
there are certain things that you do

331
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:59,330
need to produce to to to share there are

332
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,819
exclusions in each state's law around

333
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,459
security so there are opportunities that

334
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,620
you can say you know what that that is

335
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,510
protected by certain exclusions

336
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:12,889
in the law but that isn't it isn't a

337
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:16,430
brush that you can paint with broadly

338
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:22,220
they are very narrowly defined so you do

339
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:23,930
have to be aware of those transparency

340
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,900
requirements as you're building your

341
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:30,260
security controls and keep in mind that

342
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:34,970
armed people can come and ask for

343
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:37,940
certain things so again for each state

344
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,850
those laws are specific so if you're

345
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,160
running an organization say in Indiana

346
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,010
versus Illinois you're going to have

347
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,040
different rules against which you have

348
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,590
to play by but those things do come into

349
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,120
play when you're talking about you know

350
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,830
the controls that you're

351
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,949
our defining for your for your

352
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:06,070
organization and then um but there's

353
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,070
very specific and very

354
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,129
very

355
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:18,240
in jabal rewards that are involved in

356
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:23,220
working on the working in the cyberspace

357
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,440
for public entities so the the sense of

358
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:31,080
civic pride that you get with the work

359
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,080
that you're doing so the just the fact

360
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,939
that you know when you think about the

361
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,330
services that are being provided so you

362
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,279
think about whether or not traffic

363
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,710
lights are working whether or not you

364
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,529
think that you know a call to a 911 or

365
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,120
311 Center is going through and that

366
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:51,120
response is going to happen you know

367
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,918
that ambulance arrives where it needs to

368
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,080
arrive all those things are protected by

369
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,539
the control that you're putting in place

370
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,418
so you want to make sure you've got that

371
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:06,750
civic pride of saying hey you know this

372
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,850
city is running its operating and part

373
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,350
of that a small part of that is the work

374
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,350
that you're doing each and every day

375
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:18,449
speaking of opportunity there are lots

376
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,659
of opportunities so the the other side

377
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,899
of the coin of talking about challenges

378
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:27,510
with

379
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:33,239
resources is opportunity there is lots

380
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:35,850
of opportunity to do to define what it

381
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,279
is that you're going to work on within

382
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,678
the confines of the role that you're

383
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,529
hired to do within that there's lots of

384
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:48,539
opportunity to demonstrate your skill

385
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:50,880
set and arm and grow what you're doing

386
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:56,789
and learn new things because the

387
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:59,669
environment is so diverse so um and then

388
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,820
um speaking of that need the need is

389
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:05,100
great so you know I'm fortunate to be

390
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:12,230
working in an environment in Chicago

391
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,230
where not only do we have a very

392
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,899
well-put-together IT organization and we

393
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,820
have a solid foundation in terms of

394
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:24,510
cybersecurity in the controls that we're

395
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,060
delivering there are

396
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:31,020
municipalities across the country that

397
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,480
are not as fortunate in terms of that

398
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,120
and they have more challenges more

399
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,130
opportunity to go into a setting like

400
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:46,199
that and really deliver a significant

401
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:49,140
impact for those areas with the services

402
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,260
that you provide in that role and in so

403
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:57,030
doing you have the opportunity to build

404
00:20:52,260 --> 00:21:00,750
your resume build arm that that skill

405
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,580
set that you if you have the passion to

406
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,650
stay in public service for a long period

407
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,080
of time that's fantastic if it's

408
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,940
something where you're looking to build

409
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,879
that experience on your resume

410
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,530
that's fantastic to come in do a couple

411
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,290
years do two years three years four

412
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,620
years build the skills on your resume

413
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:24,060
because there's lots of opportunities to

414
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:27,629
demonstrate various skill sets and then

415
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:31,580
look to find other opportunities perhaps

416
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,580
where there is more

417
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,178
salary and what-have-you that is that is

418
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:44,840
tied to it so you know for me as a team

419
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:48,470
leader that is that is my goal to make

420
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,889
it equally attract the roles equally

421
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,750
attractive as people who have that civic

422
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:57,050
passion that they want to spend a great

423
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,410
deal of time there but also folks who

424
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:03,139
just want to come in and build some

425
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:07,429
experience and then move on to other

426
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:13,390
opportunities so on the cyber side as I

427
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:13,390
said the things that um

428
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:21,220
working in in in the government sector

429
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,399
in at the municipal level will provide

430
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,280
you that you that you know some

431
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:34,000
corporate organizations will provide you

432
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:38,379
such a wide diverse set of business

433
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,920
functions to support I think that the

434
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,309
government sector provides that a little

435
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,540
more from the standpoint of you have

436
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,428
industrial control systems you have

437
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,840
building control systems you have your

438
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:56,530
traditional IT and then you have a wide

439
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,270
variety of services that the the

440
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,690
government is providing to the

441
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,300
constituency and it's as a security

442
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,090
professional is being able to go in and

443
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,860
sit down and and learn what they are

444
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,590
trying to do what is the business that

445
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,850
they're trying to was the business

446
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,860
they're in what are the services that

447
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,870
they're providing and understand what

448
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,240
the security needs are and then turn

449
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,309
around and translate that into this to

450
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,340
this the controls that you're providing

451
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:27,280
so there are a couple folks that talked

452
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,850
about that they had your interest in red

453
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,649
teaming you know so it's it's sitting

454
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:39,639
down with the the business and

455
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:42,370
understanding the the the services that

456
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,460
they're providing that the computing

457
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:49,350
systems the the solutions that support

458
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:53,860
those business processes so that you can

459
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,600
understand how to test the applications

460
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,629
that are supporting those business

461
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,740
processes so arm you know whether that

462
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,200
is you know an internal test or if

463
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:09,390
you're just pen testing externally

464
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,710
without that additional knowledge arm

465
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,929
only using that the knowledge that

466
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,190
you're getting from a open source

467
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:22,350
perspective you have those both of those

468
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:26,530
opportunities arm to to evaluate systems

469
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:29,320
and so again

470
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:34,510
and those those opportunities I'd argue

471
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:37,030
um present themselves in a fantastic way

472
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,750
in the public sector and you have the

473
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:45,129
opportunity to to come in and in make a

474
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:47,410
mark and really either do great good for

475
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:51,010
you know where you live where you choose

476
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:54,570
to spend your time or as I said come in

477
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:57,610
do some work build that resume and then

478
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:01,090
look for challenges further challenges

479
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,719
elsewhere so with that I'm going to take

480
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,720
a pause

481
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:09,490
and open it up for questions if you have

482
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,920
any questions about the security team

483
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,080
that we have for the city of Chicago I

484
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,580
didn't get into a great deal specifics

485
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:23,889
but I am happy to answer questions about

486
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:25,570
the our set up our the services that are

487
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,020
the the capabilities that we are

488
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:33,189
providing to support the city of Chicago

489
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:36,040
our IT infrastructure and and how we

490
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,670
look to provide those to the rest of the

491
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,670
organization

492
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:47,270
um hi Bruce this is Vijay again so I

493
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:50,000
have a question regarding how the

494
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,920
government has set up in Chicago so

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,020
regarding the software and the

496
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,350
applications that the government uses do

497
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,680
they like contract them off to

498
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:04,469
third-party companies like like say for

499
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,540
extension by itself is a IT services

500
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,910
company do they contract them off to

501
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,270
third-party companies or do you handle

502
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:14,490
the security and development of the code

503
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,559
by in like government by the Chicago

504
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,760
governments employees themselves sure

505
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,970
sure

506
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,670
and so the answer is the the short

507
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:27,600
message though and again I think that's

508
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:29,640
part of what makes this you know working

509
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,139
where I'm working interesting I think

510
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,420
that a lot of other each organizations

511
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,340
unique I think there's a lot of

512
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:42,270
similarities across the municipal space

513
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,760
you get a mix of everything so from a

514
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,520
security practitioner perspective you

515
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:52,410
get the opportunity to hone your skills

516
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:55,770
across a wide variety of situations so

517
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,870
you've got some solutions that are built

518
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,809
encoded in-house you've got some

519
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,610
solutions that are built coded and

520
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,940
maintained by third parties and you also

521
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:09,750
have you know a fair number of packaged

522
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:15,390
solutions or SAS solutions so you get a

523
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:17,640
wide variety you know where arm and and

524
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,400
I think that that provides the

525
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:25,140
opportunity to to test your skills and

526
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,150
build your skills in a way that it is

527
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,840
somewhat unique

528
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,840
thank you so much

529
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,840
what other what other questions can I

530
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,510
answer

531
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,649
add another question what is your

532
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:48,680
day-to-day look like um what is my data

533
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:52,640
they look like fantastic question

534
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:57,130
it's different everyday and I mean that

535
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:02,720
just absolutely straightforward so

536
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:05,420
because we are a small team I have to

537
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,710
balance the operational with the

538
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:13,670
strategic so I spend a fair amount of my

539
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:17,600
day aiding my security operations team

540
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,980
so our our vulnerability management are

541
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,000
infinite management our security

542
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,190
engineering so whether that is

543
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,560
responding to you know the latest

544
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,240
phishing threat or things that we're

545
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,550
seeing coming in through our various

546
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:36,590
controls where whether that is helping

547
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:40,000
the security operations team or our

548
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:46,610
governance risk and compliance folks

549
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,470
engage with the departments and bringing

550
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,600
the services that we have to bear for

551
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,510
those departments and help be that

552
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:57,409
interface between the business and the

553
00:28:53,510 --> 00:29:00,200
technical it is a lot of what I do as

554
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:03,920
well and then on the strategic side arm

555
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,530
that's you know I because when you get

556
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,760
into kind of that firefighting mode you

557
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:13,490
get into a cadence of you know seeing

558
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,860
and reacting it's not losing sight of

559
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,410
the strategic as well and knowing that

560
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,750
you know you've got this really is a

561
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:26,750
long play so there are initiatives that

562
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:29,750
are going on for the quarter for the

563
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,360
year multi-year initiatives and making

564
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,820
sure that we continue to advance the

565
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,350
ball on those as well because those are

566
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,450
the things that are building new

567
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,159
controls new capabilities providing an

568
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,250
additional protection for the

569
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,070
organization it's juggling all of that

570
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:50,600
and some days it's more one than the

571
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:52,668
other and but it's there are no two days

572
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,340
that are the same

573
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:57,769
and then I'll throw out you know just

574
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,029
kind of our current situation you know

575
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,049
we are in week 5 of shelter-in-place for

576
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:04,609
the city of Chicago

577
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,200
it's either week five or weeks

578
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:09,139
everything we've learned together right

579
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,850
now so um you know we have put in

580
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:16,369
capability to allow those resources to

581
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:20,178
be able to be effective and efficient

582
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:23,449
when working remotely where prior to

583
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:26,779
this the city of Chicago is very much

584
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:33,769
focused on you know you where you did

585
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:35,779
your job was at the office and so kind

586
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,269
of turning that on its head and being

587
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:40,340
able to provide capabilities to allow

588
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,039
people to work remotely and do that in a

589
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,189
secure manner and turn that capability

590
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,509
around in a very short order yeah that

591
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,529
was an interesting challenge and

592
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:53,600
something that was you know kind of

593
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:55,009
looking back now and it's funny to say

594
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,469
looking back because we're only you know

595
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:59,450
a few weeks in looking back at putting

596
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,960
that together and working as a team

597
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:06,619
across IT to deliver that capability so

598
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,119
it was rewarding in and of itself but

599
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:12,320
also looking at it from the perspective

600
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:15,320
of that it allowed people to stay home

601
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,908
to shelter in place to not be exposed to

602
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:23,539
the virus is incredibly rewarding also

603
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:25,850
so um it's it's juggling all three of

604
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:30,230
those and it varies on the day to day

605
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:34,178
basis as to kind of which role which had

606
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,179
I spend more time doing

607
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,189
thank you so much

608
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,269
you

609
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,629
what other questions are out there at

610
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,629
this point

611
00:31:52,490 --> 00:32:00,530
I'll jump to the next piece and as you

612
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,740
have questions please let me know and

613
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:07,500
you know I I get that I'm apt uh yeah

614
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:12,870
I'm kind of at a different point in my

615
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:15,240
career arm then you are and so we're you

616
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:20,010
know when I was in your shoes and

617
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,960
starting out you know it there are so

618
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,400
many opportunities out there just as

619
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,040
there are today

620
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:31,920
and I'm excited that as security as a

621
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:35,300
field has has grown and developed to the

622
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,300
point where you know there are

623
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,540
concentrations in cyber or even degrees

624
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:45,420
in cyber at various organizations which

625
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,840
you know just simply wasn't the case

626
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:52,860
you know twenty twenty-five years ago in

627
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,620
fact I think it was 1995 that was when

628
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,110
the I think Steve Katz was named the

629
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,379
first ever T so or the person who's you

630
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,149
know widely pointed to as the first T so

631
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,030
so when you think about security as a

632
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:11,790
discipline it's something that's very

633
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:13,920
very new very very just just nascent

634
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,330
from the standpoint of here you think

635
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,800
about other disciplines you think about

636
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,659
five minutes you think about accounting

637
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,950
those are things that you know go back

638
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,550
hundreds of years

639
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:27,360
you think about even IT IT goes back you

640
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:30,450
know 50 75 plus years and you look at

641
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,260
security as a discipline just very very

642
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:36,090
young in that discipline so a lot of

643
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,850
what we're doing we're still building

644
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:42,090
and growing that and it's exciting to be

645
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:46,199
a part of that and and learn and grow

646
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:49,560
with it so some of the things that I

647
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:56,340
want to share with respect to just kind

648
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:59,970
of career arm is um is the first one is

649
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:04,199
about being a survivor and what I mean

650
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,900
by that is to adaptable be flexible and

651
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,199
be aware of time

652
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:15,060
so um being aware of our timing that

653
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:16,739
takes looking at the situation you're in

654
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,810
whatever organization you're looking at

655
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,520
you know you've got your day-to-day role

656
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:25,350
in your focus in doing that but it's

657
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:27,360
being able to be that differentiated

658
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,399
person that's able to look at the

659
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,419
organization and look at how it's doing

660
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:36,089
how its performing and where is where

661
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,830
it's going you know looking at if it's a

662
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:41,580
public organization looking at its

663
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:44,730
public filings SEC filings understanding

664
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,279
um kind of the shape that it's in and is

665
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,649
it on is it is that organization is it

666
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,669
continuing to be on the trajectory that

667
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:56,399
is going to deliver the opportunities

668
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:58,319
that you want to have is it a company

669
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,750
that's growing is it a company that is

670
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,050
in a stagnant market isn't it is it a

671
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,160
company that is in a ring key market and

672
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,050
translate that to what it's going to

673
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,060
mean for your career opportunities

674
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,800
doesn't mean you've got to take action

675
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,890
on it today but it just means making

676
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,290
sure that you are cognizant of that and

677
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:19,140
you're keeping that in mind as you're

678
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:21,540
making your plans so if it's an industry

679
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,509
that's consolidating or an organization

680
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,190
that is is shrinking that very likely is

681
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,950
going to have an impact on what your

682
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,750
opportunities are so you know kind of

683
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:34,439
playing that out two or three steps

684
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:37,650
ahead and making sure that uh that

685
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,720
you're in a position that you know is

686
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,369
going to be favorable for your career so

687
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,680
if you have to keep an eye on something

688
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:45,780
else to be looking for other things you

689
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,868
know that you're doing that and looking

690
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:52,740
out for your for your well-being being

691
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,630
adaptable and being flexible arm is you

692
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,580
know looking at what the needs of the

693
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,950
organization are and making sure that

694
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,770
you know you are translating what you're

695
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,569
doing to align with what those needs are

696
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,880
in demands are of the organization so

697
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,950
that you're viewed as a resource that is

698
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,830
you know hitting the nail on the head in

699
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:15,660
terms of what's needed so that's that

700
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,290
that's that's the the first on my list

701
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,899
there

702
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:24,569
the second is

703
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:27,690
a little inflammatory but I think this

704
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:32,220
is very important if you're bored think

705
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,440
about getting out you know if you're not

706
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,169
challenged if you're not growing if

707
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,539
you're not able to continue to develop

708
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,400
skills that are going to help the

709
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,130
organization but also going to help you

710
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,430
then that that's another indicator that

711
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,779
perhaps that opportunity you know is

712
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,149
where it may have been fantastic for you

713
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:57,000
at one point in time you may have grown

714
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,890
beyond that opportunity so making sure

715
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,329
that you're keeping an eye on that arm

716
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:06,240
and it can I find that when I get bored

717
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:08,670
when I'm not excited about something

718
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,038
that's an indicator to me that hey I

719
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,450
need to be figuring out doing something

720
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,609
else that could be within the same

721
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,890
organization it could be within another

722
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:19,020
organization could be just taking on

723
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,750
additional responsibilities could be

724
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,549
tweaking my role to do something else

725
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:27,440
they're looking for something else

726
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:30,599
within the organization to to do but

727
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,160
again kind of if you get to the point

728
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,210
where you're kind of bored and you're

729
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,390
kind of an autopilot

730
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,910
um again that may be fantastic for some

731
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,500
people for some people you know that

732
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,118
that's that's great they're just there

733
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,799
collect the check they have other things

734
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,140
in their life that are that are

735
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:49,529
delivering for them that's great we need

736
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,970
people with all types of motivation but

737
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:54,119
I think for a lot of people these a lot

738
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:58,649
of people in the security space people

739
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:00,680
we have more type-a ish personalities if

740
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,270
you start to get bored with the computer

741
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,919
looking at changing things up a little

742
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,559
bit

743
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,920
tip number three is network network

744
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,559
network and I know people harp on this a

745
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,450
lot but I can't really stress it enough

746
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,890
I think yeah I was going through some of

747
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,200
the videos of the folks we've had over

748
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,720
the course of the past six to twelve

749
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,970
months and there's a gentleman I think

750
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,230
Andrew Rose MA if I'm pronouncing that

751
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:32,459
correctly who's from Grand Rapids did a

752
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,820
whole talk on networking and I can't

753
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,170
stress

754
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,410
that enough you know you're going to

755
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,730
have all kinds of folks in your network

756
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,379
you're going to have people who are

757
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,670
mentors who you spend you have even to

758
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,310
the point of having formalized

759
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:50,880
conversations whether that be monthly or

760
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:54,420
quarterly that they you know you work

761
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,580
with them and you shape how you're

762
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,860
you're how you're developing and

763
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,370
building your career and it could some

764
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:04,110
you know all the way through people that

765
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,850
you've met a couple times you've worked

766
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,070
with you don't have a close relationship

767
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,960
with but you just don't know when these

768
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,650
people are going to come in and out of

769
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,690
your orbit as you are as you move

770
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,100
organizations or as other people move

771
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,440
organizations people that you've worked

772
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,680
with before or going you know could come

773
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,880
back in I will give the the point in

774
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:29,700
fact of you know how I found about found

775
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,340
out about this opportunity was through

776
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,339
my network so and it was one of those

777
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,890
things where um a gentleman that I know

778
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,260
I reached out to me he's like you know

779
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:43,440
what I think you would be great for this

780
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,990
and really kind of kicked me in the butt

781
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,850
a little bit to say you really need to

782
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,859
chase after this this is a this is a

783
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,779
good fit for you this is a good

784
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,830
opportunity for you to continue to grow

785
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,490
and develop

786
00:39:52,830 --> 00:40:00,870
you need to chase after this so you know

787
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:03,359
it's things like that that that if you

788
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,670
you need to have that care and feeding

789
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,610
around your network and like I said not

790
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,960
everybody is you know by the definition

791
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,370
of a network not everybody is that

792
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,010
person that you have that strong

793
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,580
mentoring relationship with it's a wide

794
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,470
variety of relationships but building

795
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,759
that network and nurturing that network

796
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:27,629
and being proactive about it will pay

797
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,120
dividends a great deal as you go through

798
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,370
as you go through your career of being

799
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:36,589
you know turned on to opportunities I

800
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:40,020
think in the talk that mr. Rosemont gave

801
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:43,740
he talked about one of his students have

802
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:46,589
a job doing some I think red teaming and

803
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,038
pentesting at a a local organization

804
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:53,130
and they had another opportunity come up

805
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:55,739
and he was like hey my buddy over here

806
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,960
he'd be great for that and pulled in you

807
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,299
know one of his one of his buddies into

808
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,819
that so again it's that that network

809
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:05,489
that's going to help you get through

810
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:07,589
your career apart is you still used a

811
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:10,279
lot to deliver yourself but it's that

812
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:14,339
network that's going to help you along

813
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:17,759
number four is be willing to take what

814
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:19,828
seems like unreasonable chances are they

815
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:23,519
have to be calculated they you know not

816
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:27,900
not advocating being reckless but it's

817
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:31,738
being able is being willing to go after

818
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,420
something that either you know part of

819
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,150
you have you know feels a little

820
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,489
uncomfortable about or you know whether

821
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:41,190
that be the position or the organization

822
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:44,369
you know obviously do your homework but

823
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,809
you know be able be willing to take take

824
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,670
a chance on something that feels

825
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:50,219
uncomfortable because that those are the

826
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,509
opportunities of growth if you if you're

827
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,890
looking at something you feel very

828
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,769
comfortable you're like yeah I can mail

829
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,868
that there's probably not a lot of

830
00:41:55,769 --> 00:42:00,689
growth opportunity there for you to

831
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:03,349
stretch you either in your technical

832
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:07,200
capabilities or your business acumen or

833
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:08,400
a particular industry so for example you

834
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,348
know I started out my career in

835
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,950
consulting so you know the consulting

836
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:15,239
opportunity that you get in learning

837
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,189
different industries in a short period

838
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:21,569
of time and how learning those different

839
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,359
businesses and how those businesses

840
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:27,210
operate will pay dividends down the road

841
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,769
in terms of you know being able when an

842
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,299
opportunity presents itself and you say

843
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:31,979
yes I've spent time in the

844
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,359
communications industry or the oil and

845
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:36,989
gas industry or the pharmaceutical

846
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,460
industry kind of that being able to

847
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,589
learn those different types of

848
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,049
businesses and the lessons that will pay

849
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:45,210
dividends later in terms of you know how

850
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:49,259
you can look at a problem and dissect

851
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:52,940
that problem and bring that knowledge to

852
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:57,839
the table it is fantastic and then

853
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:00,660
lastly ask for help even when you think

854
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,970
you may not need it um

855
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,319
so obviously no one person knows

856
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:08,819
everything and um reaching out to team

857
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:12,180
mates reaching out to people in your

858
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,369
network has many many benefits it's it's

859
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,618
going to help you refine your message so

860
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,319
you may have the message down in your

861
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,150
head of what it is so it could simply be

862
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:24,930
how you're going to attack a particular

863
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:27,660
test of a system or an application but

864
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,220
yeah it's reaching out and talking with

865
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,230
your network talking with your friends

866
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,230
but have those similar skillsets and

867
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,299
saying hey this is this is my idea what

868
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,010
do you think you know what what could I

869
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:39,538
do differently how could I look or

870
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,119
attack look at or tackle this

871
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,410
differently different angle you can take

872
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,650
on something or how you can communicate

873
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,808
something different in your in your in

874
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,670
your report to make sure that you're

875
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:52,859
clearly communicating back to the

876
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,770
stakeholders what it is you discovered

877
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:59,220
and recommendations on how to how to

878
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,990
remediate it helps give you confidence

879
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,899
that you're on the right path you know

880
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:06,390
I'm I do this a lot of times I reach out

881
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,279
to folks and you know I ask a what are

882
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,170
your thoughts on this or here's your

883
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:13,099
something that I've drafted what are

884
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:16,529
your thoughts and I encourage people to

885
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:19,020
you know kind of be a little mean about

886
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:21,660
it um give it the same hey yeah it's

887
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,880
great great job doesn't add a lot of

888
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,190
value getting that that that

889
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,470
constructive feedback that sometimes and

890
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:32,069
you mix it up a little bit is going to

891
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:35,328
improve the work that you do for that

892
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:38,460
deliverable but also going forward um

893
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:42,299
and then and it has a benefit as well

894
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:44,309
that it makes the person that you

895
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,410
reached out to you feel good that you

896
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:48,630
reach out to them and ask them for their

897
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,879
input people like that people want

898
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,520
people enjoy being sought out and saying

899
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,559
hey I had something valuable to add and

900
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,559
they reached out to me they're you know

901
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:03,539
so you're building that relationship

902
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:06,359
with that person as well so um and it

903
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,980
helps make you it helps grow your

904
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,970
leadership skills it makes you a better

905
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,400
leader and people view you in that

906
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,129
position and value what you have to say

907
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,720
because the message that you've

908
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:21,809
delivered whether that's you know in a

909
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,720
document in an email in a report or in a

910
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:27,109
presentation has been has been you've

911
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,078
gone through that sounding-board process

912
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:35,430
and it's it's improved that message so

913
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:38,640
so again so my you know by my advice is

914
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:41,848
you know be a survivor be adaptable be

915
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,129
flexible look for opportunities it's if

916
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:46,589
you're bored you know start thinking

917
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,900
about is that the right situation are

918
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:50,549
the things either there that you can

919
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,140
change tweak add to your

920
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:54,630
responsibilities different roles that

921
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,609
you could take but you probably should

922
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,200
mix something up so that you continue to

923
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:02,670
learn so you continue to grow our

924
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:06,538
network network network now for those of

925
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:09,029
us that are extroverts the the ENTJ

926
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:10,950
that that comes naturally for those of

927
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:13,109
us on the I side of things like myself

928
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,430
that doesn't come naturally it doesn't

929
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:18,270
come naturally to put myself out there

930
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:20,038
and and talk with people and get in

931
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,420
front of them but you've got to do it

932
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,279
you've got to get out there and build

933
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,220
that network that's what's going to help

934
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:27,930
strengthen your career be willing to

935
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,328
take what seems like unreasonable

936
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,399
chances you know if you feel a little

937
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,470
uncomfortable but uncomfortable about it

938
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,380
there's there's growth opportunities

939
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,538
there and then lastly ask for help even

940
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,849
opportunities where you don't think that

941
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:44,309
you need it because it's going to help

942
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:46,380
improve whatever it is you're doing and

943
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:47,670
it's going to help others you know it's

944
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,900
going to it's going to make it's going

945
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,520
to make somebody else's day they're

946
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,819
going to feel good about hey somebody

947
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:57,750
so-and-so reached out thought enough

948
00:46:53,819 --> 00:47:02,038
about my opinion to seek it out so it's

949
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:03,900
got that dual benefit there so that this

950
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,299
is a point that I want to cover today um

951
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,400
I want to open it up again for questions

952
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:09,380
whether it be anything about what I've

953
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,960
covered today

954
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,760
anything from for my history whether

955
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,500
it's what I'm doing now to city of

956
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,309
Chicago Bank of America

957
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,930
Accenture I certainly want to open it up

958
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:24,119
to all of you and if there's something

959
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,520
that I can share you know if there's

960
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,170
just one nugget that helps that you can

961
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,900
take out of the presentation today

962
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,750
it's helpful you know that's a win so I

963
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,819
certainly want to um you know provide if

964
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,270
you've got some questions that that I

965
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,270
can help with

966
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,060
you

967
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:52,410
how flexible do you see migration

968
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,149
between the public and private sector

969
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:58,109
I'm more like a state level as opposed

970
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,550
to federal level I know there's a gap

971
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:02,110
sure like migrating your career

972
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,140
transition your career from one to the

973
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,140
other

974
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,549
yeah

975
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,210
I know that's a little bit more

976
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:13,970
difficult if you're working federally as

977
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:16,940
opposed to just general state and city

978
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:20,500
government yeah I think I think federal

979
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:24,560
is a bit of a beast of itself arm and

980
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:28,520
but on the state and local level I'd say

981
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:34,160
that there that there's not I've not

982
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:35,420
noticed any excuse me issues migrating

983
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,710
between the two so I came from the

984
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,180
private sector came into the public

985
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:43,930
sector and I've had folks on my team

986
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:46,580
transition out into the private sector

987
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,379
whether that be because you know a

988
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,029
particular opportunity interested them

989
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:54,440
or there was you know a significant arm

990
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,930
Delta and salary that they could achieve

991
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,420
um you know I think those opportunities

992
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:02,020
are out there and it really at least

993
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,670
like at a state and local versa

994
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,490
into the private sector back and forth I

995
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:10,280
think it's pretty fluid and I think it's

996
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:15,740
really all about the opportunities that

997
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:18,020
you see that are interesting to you the

998
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,779
various levers that you have whether

999
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:25,160
that be you know growth into a new role

1000
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:30,080
new skills or you're wanting to achieve

1001
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:32,029
a particular industry understanding and

1002
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,200
background or if you have okay if your

1003
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:36,140
passion is about

1004
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,370
I don't know pharmaceutical research you

1005
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,540
know there's that there's the pharma

1006
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:44,799
industry versus you know and you know

1007
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:48,400
that on the state local side there are

1008
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:53,450
there just opportunities everywhere arm

1009
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:56,390
it there's really a lot of opportunity

1010
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:59,660
in the cyber in the security space for

1011
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:03,440
state and local governments at all

1012
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,299
levels so you know I'm fortunate to be

1013
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,850
in Chicago third largest city in the

1014
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,600
country but you know I grew up down the

1015
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:11,180
state

1016
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,100
I grew up three hours south of here in a

1017
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:17,290
town of you know 25 30 thousand people

1018
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:20,060
and so I also put myself in the shoes of

1019
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:24,050
folks there my family is still there

1020
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:28,100
and I think about you know how their

1021
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:31,400
needs are similar in different from the

1022
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:34,160
needs of a city like Chicago but their

1023
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,890
capability to fulfill those needs are is

1024
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,129
very very different and the ability to

1025
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:44,990
get people with strong skill sets to

1026
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:46,760
some of these um your smaller areas it

1027
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,259
is challenging so that the needs

1028
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,050
everywhere there's opportunity

1029
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,570
everywhere um so I think that it's just

1030
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,400
a question of what you would like to do

1031
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,620
and where you'd like to go how you would

1032
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,820
like to grow your career I think the

1033
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,819
opportunities are everywhere

1034
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,130
what else can I answer for folks

1035
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:17,680
hi I have another question so it is

1036
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:20,440
about your work with the city of Chicago

1037
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,529
and let me know if I'm being poking my

1038
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,660
nose too far into like government

1039
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:28,690
matters but I just want to know how the

1040
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:31,089
development cycle works with the city of

1041
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:33,370
Chicago and where exactly that the

1042
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,840
security teams step in to do their work

1043
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:37,390
like saying the integration and

1044
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:40,060
deployment or or in the beginning like

1045
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:43,029
training the developers to code securely

1046
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:46,299
I just want to know how things work sure

1047
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,790
certainly great question so we have a

1048
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,340
project management lifecycle that we

1049
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:54,009
follow within the Bureau of information

1050
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:56,380
technology and we provide services to

1051
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,760
all the core city departments so the

1052
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,310
technology projects that they have

1053
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,880
whether it be a solution acquisition or

1054
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:06,040
you know developing a solution from

1055
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,830
scratch or you know something in-between

1056
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:12,270
where you're configuring a package

1057
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:15,730
solution all of that goes through our

1058
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:17,980
project management lifecycle and my

1059
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:20,860
security team is integrated into this

1060
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,540
project management lifecycle at various

1061
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,820
stages from the beginning all the way

1062
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:27,279
through the end sub set routes so that

1063
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:32,410
we are providing input at the right

1064
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,420
stages where as needed so there that

1065
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:38,700
that's that's how things are designed

1066
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:41,200
that's how we support that um yeah and

1067
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,200
and there are like I said there are

1068
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,540
things that we are also looking to do to

1069
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,310
grow our capabilities there as well so

1070
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,500
we look at that we look at the

1071
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,450
development happening we look at how

1072
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,520
more and more cloud services are being

1073
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,770
adopted excuse me

1074
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,330
and and reevaluate what are the

1075
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,690
capabilities that we're bringing to the

1076
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:01,480
table

1077
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,580
and how do we need to grow and evolve to

1078
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,870
meet those needs and what are the things

1079
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:09,190
that we can be offering that are going

1080
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:11,680
to be consumed to that value to the

1081
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:14,560
organization so it's a continual process

1082
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,859
of you know both delivering the services

1083
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:21,060
but also making sure we're bringing the

1084
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,060
right services to the table

1085
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,609
was really informative thank you welcome

1086
