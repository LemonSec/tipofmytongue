1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,450
welcome it's my pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,050
dr. Nell roll he's a professor of

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,879
computer science okay my microphone is

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,160
all right he's a professor of criticize

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,820
at the US Naval Postgraduate School

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,980
where he has been since 1983 he has a

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,980
PhD in computer science from Stanford

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,680
University his men research interests

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,830
are in data mining digital forensics

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,420
modeling of deception and cyber warfare

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:37,050
he has also worked on tax processing

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,809
computational geometry and intelligent

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,349
tutoring system with further ado let's

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,349
welcome nail

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,920
okay great hope all of you can hear me

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,349
I'm on a committee at my school is

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,370
trying to decide in a new

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,729
teleconferencing tool and we started

19
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,699
this long before coronavirus so it was a

20
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,780
very timely committee to be on so we're

21
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,430
trying number of different things we

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,170
don't use WebEx but we've been using

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,839
three other different tools and we're

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,020
trying to decide which one to use so I'm

25
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,539
going to talk about digital forensics

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,939
today and particularly our approach uses

27
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:17,289
real data so we're very interested in

28
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:20,050
trying to find actual usage of computers

29
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:21,610
and digital devices and see what people

30
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,920
are doing on those devices so it's

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,950
similar to what field biologists do when

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,690
they go out and observe an ecosystem and

33
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,459
they try to figure out what's going on

34
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,940
in the ecosystem and when interactions

35
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,950
there are in the case of computers this

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,908
course is not the usual approach in

37
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,130
computer science

38
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,990
mostly what computer scientists do is to

39
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,190
develop algorithms and protocols and

40
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,500
things like that and test them with with

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,750
the particular training sets but what I

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,030
want to see is raw data in real training

43
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,310
situations and things like that and so

44
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,799
we've collected a large collection of

45
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,409
digital data that I'll explain about in

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,689
a moment here so we're going to use

47
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,829
machine learning and big data processing

48
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,288
we're going to use a lot of different

49
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,729
things to do that and today I'm going to

50
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,519
give you a sample of some of the

51
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,040
projects that we work on three research

52
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,440
projects in particular one is going to

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,810
to analyze the best places that malware

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,390
could be on a computer system or digital

55
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,120
device one is going to look for patterns

56
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,910
of updates to executables to decide what

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,040
normal patterns are for executable

58
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,950
updates so we can recognize abnormal

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,239
patterns and then I'm going to talk

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,339
about some of the general background

61
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,549
that I need to do these projects which

62
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,780
is excluding of uninteresting files

63
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:40,600
digital forensics has been around for

64
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,600
quite a while now and it's basically

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,239
technology for trying to analyze

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,569
secondary storage there are also digital

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,440
forensic projects on main memory and

68
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,760
network data my focus has always been on

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,230
secondary storage because you've got a

70
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,970
lot of things that are more prone

71
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,859
it on the secondary storage and they

72
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,129
give you a better idea what people are

73
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,040
trying to do so we have this wonderful

74
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,480
test corpus that was developed by

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,239
professor Simpson Garfinkel who's now

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,819
moved on to the Census Bureau and it's

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,420
got about 4,000 drives in the collection

78
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:20,230
a drive is a copy of the secondary

79
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,768
storage of a computer or a mobile device

80
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,679
and so we've got about 3,200 computers

81
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,750
there are 400 mobile devices and then

82
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,879
I've also added to that my own

83
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,950
collection of classroom and laboratory

84
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,970
computers at the school including some

85
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,310
of our own individual computers and they

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,810
contain typically a lot of data compared

87
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,489
to some of these other things because we

88
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,970
have a lot of mobile things and also

89
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:48,579
computers not very much used so

90
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,410
altogether we got about 4,000 drives now

91
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,560
people keep asking me if they can use

92
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,599
this there are some obstacles to using

93
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,849
this because there is private

94
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,429
information on this the way we obtained

95
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,649
this most of this data is we hired a guy

96
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,840
to go around the world and go into

97
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,450
computer stores and buy used equipment

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,299
and then once he got the equipment copy

99
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,828
of the secondary storage and sure he

100
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,470
found a number of drives that have been

101
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:17,168
wiped or erased but there was a

102
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,269
surprising number of drives and devices

103
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,889
that had not been erased and as I've

104
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,380
written in some of my work even if you

105
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,450
do try to do a factory reset on a mobile

106
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,690
device a lot of information remains on

107
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,789
the mobile device so he we got quite a

108
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,680
lot of interesting data from all over

109
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,349
the world the emphasis on all over the

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,750
world was that there are more difficult

111
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:40,810
restrictions if you with privacy if you

112
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,510
work on data from US citizens and so we

113
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,310
have to be careful with that in addition

114
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,340
to all the files on these drives we also

115
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,020
obtained some artifact data we found

116
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,780
things like email addresses phone

117
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,750
numbers bank card numbers personal names

118
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,000
we're also a big thing there and keyword

119
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,280
searches that people had done URLs they

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,690
visited and things like that I won't

121
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,200
talk about that today

122
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,510
uh so anyway we're going to use a lot of

123
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,400
basic machine learning I'm not a big fan

124
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,199
of using fancy methods in

125
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,969
scene learning so I'm not a big fan of

126
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,490
using neural networks I really want

127
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,680
techniques that are easy to explain and

128
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,840
easy to justify so we've done a lot of

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,090
stuff with naive Bayes reasoning and

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,099
we've done a lot of stuff with linear

131
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,929
models where we just add up a bunch of

132
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,120
factors and use those to decide things

133
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,240
and so we're going to use a lot of these

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,530
methods for the the three projects I'm

135
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,419
going to talk about ok so the first

136
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,508
project we're going to talk about we

137
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,909
want to identify where malware is likely

138
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,910
to be on a drive because there are these

139
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,500
things called quick scans that are often

140
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,990
done to try to find malware and we'd

141
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,460
like to see we can speed them up first

142
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,710
to find malware we can always do

143
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,780
signature checking it won't find truly

144
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,370
new malware though so that's always the

145
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,010
disadvantage that we can do static

146
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,479
analysis but it can make mistakes if it

147
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,599
doesn't understand what it's looking at

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,669
or somebody has obfuscated the code we

149
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,009
can do behavioral analysis but you need

150
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,650
a safe place to do that and it can take

151
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,930
some time and also the malware may try

152
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,609
to fool you and then you can go on

153
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,650
reputation of source but you don't

154
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,510
always know where it came from

155
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,659
or it may be spoofing and also

156
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,159
reputations can be bought so there's a

157
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:29,380
lot of problems in trying to analyze

158
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:32,860
malware and try to do stuff so the

159
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,599
question is can we at least get an idea

160
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,580
where malware is likely to be on a

161
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,620
computer system or at least new malware

162
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,820
is likely to be but we haven't already

163
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,940
caught that's on our systems and so

164
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,240
pretty much every anti-malware vendor

165
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,159
has a quick scan feature and there's

166
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,710
been very little study of whether these

167
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,599
are actually checking the most likely

168
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,570
places on the computers so we attempted

169
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,909
to try to get some evidence of from our

170
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,210
huge collection here the 4000 drives of

171
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:06,699
where the malware actually was so in

172
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,830
order to do this we needed a blacklist

173
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,720
and we needed a whitelist and the

174
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,820
blacklist is a list of things that are

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,849
known to be malware and so we've got

176
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,880
280,000 files in our corpus and so we

177
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,349
applied these methods to the 280,000 or

178
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,590
in the case of the 4

179
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:30,160
and fifth ones to a sample of the corpus

180
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,929
the first thing is we bought a

181
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,060
subscription for a year to something

182
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,390
called bit 9 forensic service which is a

183
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,030
service that gives you block listing and

184
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,710
white listing checking so you can check

185
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,739
to see if something's known to be bad or

186
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,229
known to be good and it's expensive

187
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,890
though it was $50,000 a year that's why

188
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,180
we only did it for one year and did a

189
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,700
pretty thorough job

190
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,440
I'll explain something about where that

191
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,400
came from and some other stuff in a

192
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,460
moment here then we used 2 virus

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,690
collections one called open malware and

194
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:10,030
no pardon me yeah open malware and virus

195
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,590
share virus share is pretty well known

196
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,559
open malware we start of an earlier

197
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,330
version of that and you can actually

198
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,000
download the malware from that if you

199
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,909
give them a good enough set of

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,720
credentials for doing that but we didn't

201
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,820
have to download them the malware we got

202
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,170
the hash codes we got the hash codes of

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,719
everything they had in their collection

204
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:35,140
and we matched them to the hash codes

205
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,360
that we had on files in our corpus so we

206
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,679
found how many items in the corpus we

207
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,050
could identify our school has uses

208
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,050
semantics so we were able to run

209
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,849
semantic on a portion of the data and

210
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,959
same thing with clamavi which is a nice

211
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,760
open-source antivirus tool now we were

212
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,020
only able to do a sample because one of

213
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,510
the problems with dealing with the

214
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,930
corpus this large is it it takes like a

215
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,450
40 terabytes of data so we can't store

216
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,430
it in easily accessible format so we

217
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,830
have it on backup all the time so in

218
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,270
order to do these tests I would have to

219
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,670
pull I had to pull things out of the

220
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,590
corpus and that takes time it takes time

221
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,599
to actually go to the location and each

222
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,640
one of these storage drives and pull

223
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,440
everything out so instead I took a

224
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,090
random sample of these particular things

225
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,540
so they not complete but the first day

226
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,100
of 3 things we got a pretty complete

227
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,000
indication of of all the malware in a

228
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,220
corpus so all together we got about

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,370
300,000 instances of malware that we

230
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,000
found in the 280 million files of our

231
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,290
corpus

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,120
so the rate was about 0.1% so we think

233
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,599
that's probably pretty typical of a lot

234
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,450
of users out there in the world of

235
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,000
course you know we didn't really take a

236
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,380
random sample of users we had some we

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,150
had more likely to have things from

238
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,000
governments and business than we had

239
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,680
from home users but nonetheless it's a

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,840
good start to try to figure out what's

241
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,250
going on with malware and the white

242
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,680
lists we mid 9 gave us a white list of

243
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,120
executables that thought were ok and we

244
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,120
also used the national software

245
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,960
reference library and srl which is a

246
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,780
well-known collection of hash codes and

247
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,970
other data for standard software the way

248
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,220
they get that is they hire interns every

249
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,900
summer that download a whole lot of

250
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,880
software for them and then they compute

251
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,090
the hash codes on it but they don't run

252
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,830
the software they just get the static

253
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,600
analysis of it in order to get hash

254
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,020
codes so they miss a lot of possible

255
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,030
files you'd find on real systems and

256
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,430
then finally we use for a whitelist a

257
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,230
random sample of our corpus - those

258
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,219
identified as nowhere

259
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,930
as I say it's point 1 percent rate of

260
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,690
malware but if you exclude the known

261
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,870
malware we probably have a lower rate so

262
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,210
it's not perfect way to get a whitelist

263
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,200
but it's probably pretty likely to work

264
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:06,220
and in particular we're interested in

265
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,780
things that are very very common for

266
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,550
instance we're interested in the common

267
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,110
sorts of things that would be malware

268
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,109
and so we're not going to miss those by

269
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,030
using that as a whitelist anyway we're

270
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,160
also by the way when he going to be

271
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,670
using normative methods like Bayesian

272
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,589
and reasoning and and linear models so

273
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,329
those two add up a bunch of factors and

274
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,660
compute means and standard deviations

275
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,130
and so if you do that the effect of

276
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,709
including a few items of malware and

277
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,730
your whitelist is not going to be very

278
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,370
dramatic well anyway so here's my chart

279
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,700
of the intersections of these various

280
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,230
hash sets that we got and the striking

281
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,880
thing about this is when we put this

282
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,430
together is that there's very little

283
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,180
overlap between the the malware

284
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,609
detection methods the

285
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,439
i'm evans they if you look for instance

286
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,970
the numbers this is the bit nine threats

287
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,089
it found two hundred and thirty nine

288
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,100
thousand things in our corpus where

289
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,399
we're labeled as malware by one of the

290
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,610
five by the bit nine methods anyway but

291
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,990
if you look at for instance virus share

292
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,350
there were only twenty eight of those

293
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,209
that virus share had in its collection

294
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,170
only fourteen then open four hundred

295
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:19,819
eighteen that open malware ahead and you

296
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,089
can look also compare this even though

297
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,890
this is a sample sir semantics and

298
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:27,410
clamavi you can see the numbers are real

299
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,149
worrisome for this semantic found

300
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,240
fourteen hundred and thirty four things

301
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:35,810
in our sample by the way the two numbers

302
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,070
may indicate how many total instances

303
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,020
were there and how many of them were

304
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,790
unique instances so there were fourteen

305
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,180
hundred and thirty-four instances of

306
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,790
malware identified by Symantec 1401 of

307
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,170
those were unique so anyway but if you

308
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,149
look at some of these other things like

309
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,370
open malware and virus share only

310
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:56,330
nineteen of those were found in the

311
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,680
virus we're Irish air collection two

312
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,470
hundred and ninety eighty nine were

313
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,660
found in the the bit nine collection so

314
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,209
clearly there's a lot of disagreement

315
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,910
between malware identification methods

316
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,189
as to what is malware they seem to be

317
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,620
looking for different things I

318
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,180
we have a foundation at our school and I

319
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,580
was presenting my research to the

320
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,589
foundation and there was a guy from

321
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,000
Apple there and so everybody turned to

322
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,640
the guy from Apple said is this really

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,950
true that security is this bad and he

324
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,230
said yeah that's basically the the dirty

325
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,820
secret we have that our security methods

326
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,670
aren't working too well because there's

327
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,470
not a lot of agreement between different

328
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,770
methods for identifying what is malware

329
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,050
and what's not of malware here's some

330
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,850
statistics on the rates as you'd expect

331
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,800
at our school where we've got a firewall

332
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,480
the rates are pretty low but a lot of

333
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,250
this real data corpus didn't use

334
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,020
firewalls and things like that so the

335
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,480
rates are higher here so it gives you a

336
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,579
little bit of idea about them the the

337
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,670
overall rates of malware occurring in

338
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,770
things so here's our main results here

339
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,020
what we're trying to do is measure the

340
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,390
number of standard deviations above the

341
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,800
expected value for each of these clues

342
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,519
that's listed on the

343
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,349
side here and and so number of standard

344
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,410
deviations is assuming a Poisson

345
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,779
distribution and plus numbers mean that

346
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,760
it's above the expected value minus

347
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,589
numbers means it's below the expected

348
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,019
value and you can see most of these

349
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,510
numbers are below the expected values so

350
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:26,089
most of these were not good clues to

351
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,750
malware we tried some obvious things

352
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,190
including some standard things like

353
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,839
whether we have a double extension

354
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:38,120
whether somebody had a file that was

355
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,950
labeled for instance Exe txt and a bunch

356
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,649
of things like that and those turned out

357
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,510
not to be good clues a few positive

358
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:48,740
clues where things like for instance was

359
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,870
it a deleted file and so these are

360
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,180
standard deviations ago the mean for the

361
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,040
five methods agreed that being a deleted

362
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,599
file was a good clue to malware of

363
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,790
course part of the reason something is

364
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,970
deleted is your anti-malware may have

365
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,010
deleted it automatically and so that's

366
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,660
probably the reason open malware

367
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,610
disagreed though interesting that

368
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,500
there's little consensus between these

369
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,570
methods in some of these cases so we

370
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,899
just took majority vote on many of these

371
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,690
things here rare extension turned out to

372
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,540
me another good clue rare we defined is

373
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,390
occurring only once in our collection so

374
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,279
any any file in our collection of four

375
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,410
thousand drives that had an extension

376
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,640
and only occurs once turned that turned

377
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,120
out to be a good clue that it was

378
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,920
malware which is kind of interesting

379
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,339
have a second page here which shows some

380
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,800
of the breakdowns for particularly ins

381
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:42,170
top-level directories and intermediate

382
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,359
directories and so this is pretty much

383
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,060
what you'd expect the executables did

384
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,209
have it did tend to be have a higher

385
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,670
proportion of malware in them and also

386
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:55,339
security directories tended to have a

387
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,870
higher proportion of malware as you'd

388
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,260
expect because a lot of security

389
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,250
directories contained quarantines of

390
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,160
malware and things like that

391
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,630
so kind of interesting it does confirm

392
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,029
some of this but again you see a lot of

393
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,070
negative numbers there indicating that

394
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,260
they weren't good positive close we can

395
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,540
use negative clues too if we're trying

396
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,699
to do quick scan but we really want to

397
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,390
know where the the devel war is hiding

398
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:21,260
and that require

399
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,990
is positive clues so here's a breakdown

400
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,870
couple of graphs of Mel where fraction

401
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,510
by size and depth in the file hierarchy

402
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,310
so you see there's a peak on the green

403
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,500
curve which indicates size for a

404
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,869
relatively small file so a lot of

405
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,960
malware is pretty small there's also a

406
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:41,660
peak over here for very large files this

407
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,180
is the logarithm of the size by the way

408
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,910
so so this peak over here represents

409
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,829
rootkits and other collections of

410
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,709
malicious stuff

411
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,420
the blue curve indicates the level in

412
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,880
the high Oh file hierarchy and you can

413
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,579
see that Mel whare tends to not go any

414
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,200
deeper than a level 11 and so you could

415
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:04,270
probably be pretty safe with anything

416
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,270
below 11 in your file hierarchy aa

417
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,780
number of drives in which a hash occurs

418
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,569
now this turned out to be quite

419
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,990
interesting because one of the things

420
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,760
that intrusion detection systems and

421
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,620
intrusion prevention systems are trying

422
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,359
to do today is to increase their

423
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,550
performance by bringing in something

424
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,609
called reputation so they're trying to

425
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:28,399
say how likely is it to be

426
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:31,760
malware based on on things like the

427
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,370
reputation of the the vendor or how

428
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,560
often it occurs and if they're using how

429
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,909
often it occurs as a measure this this

430
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,679
argues that they could be in trouble

431
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,140
because you see there were quite a few

432
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,540
things that occurred 18 times this first

433
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,390
peak is for 18 times a bunch of things

434
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,550
that occurred about 215 times and a

435
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,130
bunch of things that occurred 285 times

436
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,530
that's the number of drives that they

437
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,170
occurred on so they were spread all over

438
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,570
and yet they were malware so I think

439
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,360
it's questionable whether you can use

440
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,450
popularity as an indication of whether

441
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,139
it's low safe to to assume that it's

442
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,130
okay it doesn't have malware in it and

443
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,720
but you know people that are doing

444
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,760
intrusion detection systems are pretty

445
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,040
desperate for any way to improve things

446
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,520
they may be pushing too far I think on

447
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,790
this so anyway we can put all these

448
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,110
clues together to get a quick scan since

449
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,090
we've got the number of standard

450
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,040
deviations above and below the mean we

451
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,560
can turn that into a probability on a

452
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,100
plus on distribution and then compute

453
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,500
odds

454
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,949
here's the odds form of naivebayes which

455
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,250
we used in our experiments and so we

456
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,350
basically got some recall precision F

457
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,590
score values for these we've got a F

458
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,360
score around 250 the recall is all

459
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,139
argument a little bit is actually more

460
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,510
important than the precision here so

461
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,870
that may not look so good but if you

462
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,980
just look at the executable files only

463
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,409
you're going to get in the F score of

464
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,140
point zero zero nine seven not all that

465
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,559
great and so we're doing quite a bit

466
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,390
better so our methods got five times

467
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,190
better precision with one point seven

468
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,590
times better recall over inspecting

469
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,600
executables alone so even though quick

470
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,240
scan seems like something really simple

471
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,309
for a vendor to implement they did they

472
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,929
should put some more care into what

473
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,908
they're doing when they do a quick scan

474
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,039
because it's not unnecessarily in the

475
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:27,380
obvious places one obvious thing by the

476
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,200
way is we found many many examples of

477
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,630
malware in places that were not in

478
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,789
executable directories so malware is

479
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,260
hiding all over the place and you need

480
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,360
to take that into account when you're

481
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,010
looking for it

482
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,539
he also tested just looking at the

483
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,750
operating system that did even worse

484
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,980
than looking only at the executables of

485
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,590
course you could argue that the

486
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:52,130
operating system is more important but

487
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,720
you know even if malware is in some

488
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,870
unimportant part of the system it could

489
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,520
spread to the operating system and

490
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,520
that's always the worry with malware

491
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,650
okay so that's the first topic I'd like

492
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,889
to move along here and we can take

493
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:12,390
questions at the end if you like we've

494
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,650
been studying lately executable patterns

495
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,220
patterns of executables when they get

496
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,980
updated and so what we're interested in

497
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,890
was what changed between executables

498
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,330
well if you have the source code you can

499
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,030
look at the source code and figure out

500
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:31,270
what they changed but many vendors don't

501
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,129
allow you access to the source code so a

502
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,410
question is can we do something useful

503
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,480
with just the executables to figure out

504
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,310
something was changed if it's a small

505
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,170
update usually it doesn't change a whole

506
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,730
lot of the executable and we should be

507
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,460
able to match up the parts of the

508
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,090
executable that change and so we'd like

509
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,100
to do this part of this is to figure out

510
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,669
what the normal patterns of updates are

511
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,830
and see if we can figure that out and so

512
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,380
women somebody does an abnormal update

513
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,060
we can recognize that so anyway we're

514
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,400
going to compare bytes between files and

515
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,990
this work is quite simple minded in then

516
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,440
we're just going to compare every byte

517
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,510
of two files and see where they match up

518
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,310
and every week we'll try every possible

519
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,129
way of matching up what we'd like to

520
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,169
find is a sequence though of bytes that

521
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,570
matches to a sequence of bytes in the

522
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,520
other file and the more of those we can

523
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,620
find the more content in our we found

524
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,440
the mapping from one files code to

525
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,600
another so here's an example of one of

526
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,610
the displays we generate the blue means

527
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,370
things that match between two files this

528
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,770
this spectrum like bar is represents one

529
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,590
file and this bar represents another

530
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,020
file and the blue means exact matches

531
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:44,980
consecutive matches that matched exactly

532
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:49,030
between the two files there the other

533
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,520
colors green magenta and red represent

534
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,100
matches at every second byte every

535
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,870
fourth byte in every eighth byte and the

536
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,480
reason for that is of course there are

537
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:02,169
64-bit machines and 32-bit machines

538
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,910
around and so oftentimes if they it's

539
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,550
just the arguments that change the

540
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,950
operands that change to a machine

541
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,750
instruction the machine instruction

542
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,180
remains the same and you can get matches

543
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,470
on just the machine instruction and so

544
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,240
we were trying to see if

545
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,950
we could find some of those these

546
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,809
particular files dough didn't have a

547
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,789
whole lot of those kinds of matches they

548
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:24,908
had more mainly the blue which means

549
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:27,820
unbroken strings of all exact operands

550
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:30,970
and operators in the machine code

551
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,918
they're so pretty good the white areas

552
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,169
are areas that didn't match so there was

553
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,210
quite a bunch of data probably in this

554
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:39,009
area here that didn't match at all

555
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,259
between these two versions and could

556
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:44,049
represent for instance different

557
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,240
websites or things different parameters

558
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:50,049
that you're supposed to use and running

559
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,759
this software I a student came up with

560
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:54,429
an alternative representation where he

561
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,169
actually showed which which parts of one

562
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,759
file connected to the parts of the other

563
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,580
file that match the parts of the other

564
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,110
file so this is a little messed up and

565
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,580
hard to read but you can sort of see

566
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,899
that there were some things from right

567
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,340
at the beginning here that matched some

568
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,000
things towards the end of the other file

569
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,000
which is interesting

570
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:14,500
so we'll match up all these files so

571
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,658
what we did is we collected all the

572
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,279
files in our corpus that had the same

573
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:25,059
name same file name and we calculated

574
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:28,779
their hash codes and we got put picked

575
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:30,820
one instance of each hash code and those

576
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,730
were our versions that we used for

577
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,309
comparison so there are really three

578
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,929
kinds of different reasons why you might

579
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,928
have a different hash code with the same

580
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:42,909
name could be a software update since

581
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,090
we've got a corpus that extends over

582
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:47,710
quite a period of years we can see the

583
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,289
same file at different times on

584
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,750
different computers and we can see what

585
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:54,340
the normal software updates are they

586
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,220
also could be different versions for

587
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,840
different operating systems so if that's

588
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,299
the case we're probably going to see oh

589
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,539
the updates are the different versions

590
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:06,789
all having creation times at about the

591
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,860
same time and then the third thing

592
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,809
perhaps the most interesting one but the

593
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,908
rarest is that malware may have changed

594
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:14,440
the file or it may have been a Trojan

595
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,450
horse to begin with and so even though

596
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,539
it's got the name of something that is a

597
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,429
legitimate file it may have quite

598
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:24,279
different contents and in fact we found

599
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,110
a lot of cases where cochin horses in

600
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,429
this collection here it didn't seem like

601
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,080
malware authors we're trying to

602
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:33,139
pretty much to conceal what they were

603
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,210
doing when when they gave names to files

604
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,100
that were completely different and also

605
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,149
completely different size oftentimes

606
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,949
than the original file there anyway so

607
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,739
here are two examples I want to show you

608
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:52,759
the plots that we can generate the first

609
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:55,730
one is a plot for a hotfix exe and it's

610
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:58,700
a file that that Microsoft Iver uses for

611
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,619
doing updates quick updates and things

612
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,970
like that and you can see there's

613
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:03,860
clearly patterns here where they're a

614
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,690
whole bunch of versions that occurred

615
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,119
almost the same time so those are

616
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,519
clearly versions for different hardware

617
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:13,009
or operating systems another bunch here

618
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,929
similar to that another bunch of three

619
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:18,110
here another bunch of four here so those

620
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,990
are clearly the same just versions for

621
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,559
different environments of the same basic

622
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:28,789
thing now the way this diagram works is

623
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:31,309
that I drew lines between each version

624
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:34,759
which is a node and the most similar

625
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,619
previous version and so there's a line

626
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,470
always to the most similar previous

627
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:41,240
version and I can get its similarity as

628
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,639
I say by counting the number of

629
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,309
sequences in common so sequences of

630
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:51,379
whereof had to be of 10 or more items in

631
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:53,539
order to count so you you can clearly

632
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,850
see there's a there's a number of normal

633
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,590
sort of software updates like bug fixes

634
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,668
and things like that along these lines

635
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,529
but they're not terribly regular in the

636
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:04,940
connection so I would anytime you see

637
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,769
things like that where the very there's

638
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,499
quite a varying amount of time on the

639
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:13,490
horizontal axis that probably means that

640
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:14,899
they they were bug fixes of some sort so

641
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,059
what are these guys down here these are

642
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:19,309
probably mobile devices here because

643
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:22,519
these are don't have any sufficiently

644
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:24,950
similar item up here so it looks like

645
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,899
these were probably for particular

646
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,879
mobile devices or some sort of

647
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,768
specialized architecture there were a

648
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,209
few connections between them but not too

649
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:34,240
many because they weren't they seem to

650
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,580
be all pretty different from one another

651
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,399
so that's one diagram I want to show you

652
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,290
now this one involves more malware so

653
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:45,969
this is CDF viewed

654
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:48,470
DLL which is a Microsoft executable and

655
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,150
you see that there for a while there was

656
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,250
going on pretty normally here there were

657
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,290
stood there a couple of would appear to

658
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,720
be bug fixes because the slopes are

659
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,010
different here over the time but then

660
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,950
all of a sudden there seem to be a lot

661
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,660
of different versions here so these

662
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,730
different versions are probably all

663
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,100
malware because that's not a normal

664
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,570
pattern for software vendors to create

665
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,540
all sorts of different things and

666
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:14,050
equally spaced time periods it turns out

667
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,159
CDF vu is a particularly appealing

668
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,870
[Music]

669
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:21,200
program for for malware to target

670
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,750
because you can use it to to hide things

671
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,550
in the operating system from people and

672
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:31,340
so there were quite a lot of attacks on

673
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:35,210
CDF via that we saw okay most

674
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,220
executables do have the same entropy

675
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,160
pattern so one of the things we want to

676
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,110
do to improve this is to only match the

677
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,150
parts of executables that are likely to

678
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,280
be the most helpful in understanding

679
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,470
what's going on and that means the code

680
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,649
generally that sometimes the data can be

681
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,420
interesting too but code is the most

682
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,270
interesting clearly the header is

683
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,550
probably not very interesting so you can

684
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,620
look at a file by computing its entropy

685
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,419
and see these parts of the file pretty

686
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,629
obviously in the case of most

687
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,090
executables in this case it looks like

688
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,730
there were about 256 bytes at the

689
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,409
beginning that have a relatively low

690
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,300
entropy so that's got to be the header

691
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,800
and then there was some code and then

692
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,990
there were some data including some big

693
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,540
blank areas in the this data here

694
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:24,250
probably the data is formatted so things

695
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:28,850
start on even multiples of powers of two

696
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:31,190
to to find the stuff there the entropy

697
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,610
for the code you notice is pretty

698
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,760
consistent here we were using the the

699
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:41,899
byte average byte entropy on every 512

700
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,600
bytes in the the file so the average but

701
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,000
it goes up and down a little bit you can

702
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,409
have variations in 512 bytes but there

703
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,650
aren't too many it things seems to be

704
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,560
hanging around 5.5 as the the average

705
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,029
value so that's to be contrasted with

706
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,859
say and

707
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:00,889
coded or encrypted files which tend to

708
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:02,840
be 7.5 or so on the entropy so you can

709
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:06,498
clearly tell the difference between

710
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,009
those things and so I think what we'll

711
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:11,539
do in the future is focus on the using

712
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:14,269
the entropy to guide us as to which

713
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:16,249
parts are best to match here's another

714
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:20,299
graph of some of the entropy values we

715
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:21,950
had in our collection here so there's a

716
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:24,408
peak here that you can't see very well

717
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,779
in the diagram right in zero and as

718
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:30,549
you'd expect there's lots of lots of

719
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:33,440
zero bytes in files on computer systems

720
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:35,629
with executables often the zero bytes

721
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,570
are used because things are supposed to

722
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:40,968
start at powers of two and other stuff

723
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,249
like that so zero bytes you'll see an

724
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:46,159
awful lot of and the other Peaks are

725
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:49,399
there's a peak care for text between

726
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,469
three and four so these are text things

727
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,478
embedded in the middle of in other words

728
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:55,879
strings strings embedded within

729
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:58,869
executables and here's the peak I was

730
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:02,498
saying that between five and six for

731
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:04,999
code and then here's the peak for and

732
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:09,289
encoded and encrypted stuff within the

733
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:11,389
executable and in most most encodings

734
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,739
there are a lot of encoding x' but of

735
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:15,519
course the point of all of good

736
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:18,649
encodings is that they try to try to

737
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,139
capture the redundancy and eliminate the

738
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:23,869
redundancy as much as possible and so

739
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:25,129
you typically with with many encoding x'

740
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:27,439
you get something that looks very much

741
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:28,998
like encryption that's pretty high so

742
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,120
that's probably what this peak is over

743
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:38,600
here on the right okay so the

744
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,479
I want to talk about is interesting

745
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,159
versus uninteresting files so we have a

746
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,790
sponsor in the intelligence community

747
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,710
whose name I can give you but they

748
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,870
basically are interested in doing

749
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,000
digital forensics on things that they

750
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,439
collect from various parts of the world

751
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,270
like the Middle East they've been doing

752
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,160
a lot of stuff on trying to analyze

753
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,360
terror terrorist groups in the Middle

754
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,520
East and insurgencies and things like

755
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,990
that that are of military significance

756
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,710
they do a lot of work for the military

757
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,690
and so one of the problems they have is

758
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,970
they have to do investigations very

759
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,230
quickly oftentimes there's they're

760
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,910
worried about a terrorist attack and

761
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,490
they want to make sure that they get

762
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,429
warning about a terrorist attack so

763
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,559
they're given days to analyze something

764
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,780
important and a lot of these things I've

765
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,740
been talking about so far take long

766
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,660
amounts of time to perform you've got to

767
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,730
get if you're going to scan the entire

768
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,980
drive I don't know if you've used any of

769
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:40,280
these forensic tools but I use the

770
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:43,070
autopsy tool a lot and to load a typical

771
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:47,000
Drive that it takes like 12 hours or so

772
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:49,010
and do some analysis of it so just

773
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,840
getting the data up and loaded can be a

774
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,490
problem just transferring it to one of

775
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,320
these drives takes me three hours to

776
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,510
take something that takes 12 hours to

777
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,428
process usually takes me about 3 hours

778
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:02,300
to copy onto the drive where I'm going

779
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:04,610
to do the analysis so I'm eliminating

780
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:08,030
uninteresting data is a really critical

781
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,860
issue in digital forensics and so the

782
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,629
sponsor had me looking at this and

783
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,729
trying to figure out what to do now I

784
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,890
have mentioned the National software

785
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,660
reference library and that's a good

786
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,330
start it can eliminate some of the

787
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,700
things because they they basically

788
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,710
download all the major software in the

789
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,270
world and install it on their computers

790
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,940
and compute hash codes so if you see

791
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,590
those same hash codes you can know

792
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,840
they're probably unlikely to be

793
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,899
interesting even though in SRL and the

794
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,899
NIST that sponsors them don't provide a

795
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,179
guarantee that there is no malware in

796
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,650
their collection but it's pretty but my

797
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:47,360
experience has been it's pretty pretty

798
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:48,650
low probability so question is can we do

799
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,320
something with

800
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,450
the other files typically n srl

801
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,149
eliminates 20% of the files on your

802
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,140
drive but when I've looked at drives in

803
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,740
more detail

804
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,900
I think 95% of the files on a drive are

805
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,300
typically not interesting for most

806
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,710
forensic investigations now there are

807
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,480
really three kinds of forensic

808
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,550
investigations there are ones that

809
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,260
involve criminal activity so they're

810
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,020
criminal investigations the police and

811
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,629
Bartons doing things like that or civil

812
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,129
civil court cases anything legal then

813
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,900
there's a second category that have to

814
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,760
do with intelligence-gathering which is

815
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,500
what my sponsor is interested in and

816
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,910
then there's a third category of

817
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,660
applications which have to do with

818
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:32,600
malware and and maintaining security on

819
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,820
computer systems so for the first two

820
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,820
categories eliminating uninteresting

821
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,550
data is important it's also important

822
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,649
with malware 2 but the main issue is

823
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,659
that you're going to need to at least do

824
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,400
a scan of the entire drive at some point

825
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:50,270
before you can start to focus on where

826
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,610
the Mel ware might be anyway so we

827
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:56,350
developed our own technique for doing

828
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:59,810
this that eliminates a whole lot more

829
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:04,490
files from investigation than in SRL

830
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:07,480
does and it uses these 9 criteria now my

831
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:11,570
sponsor likes the idea of things being

832
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,449
binary or absolute and so they didn't

833
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,370
want me to compute a probability of the

834
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:19,428
given these clues but instead they

835
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,049
wanted some absolute thresholds and such

836
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,060
that over the threshold it would be

837
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,710
malware below the threshold and be ok or

838
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,239
above the threshold to be interesting

839
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,620
below the threshold would be

840
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:33,199
uninterested so what our approach we

841
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,449
developed was to say if it matches if

842
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,449
the file matches two of these nine

843
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,370
criteria then we're going to exclude it

844
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,109
as being uninteresting and I'll show you

845
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,449
the results of our testing on our

846
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,460
training set they could look pretty good

847
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:50,330
as the two out of nine worked pretty

848
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:53,360
well so criteria are frequent hash value

849
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,719
something that occurs many times on the

850
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,800
in the corpus is probably uninteresting

851
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,439
usually you're interested in things that

852
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,210
are unique to the user of a single

853
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,089
computer or

854
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,589
mobile device so things that occur a lot

855
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,330
of time probably not interesting they

856
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:10,040
could be frequent paths they could be

857
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,390
frequent file name directory pairs if

858
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,380
they're being moved around in different

859
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:17,150
paths and different operating systems

860
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,599
another criteria is unusually busy times

861
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,760
for a drive something occurs a all at

862
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,680
once there were a lot of downloads all

863
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,710
at once in one directory that's probably

864
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,359
an installation of software or

865
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,730
installation of a file that set of files

866
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,609
that are probably not too interesting

867
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,500
for you and then unusually busy weeks in

868
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,690
the carpus when Microsoft does a major

869
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,270
update you'll see across our entire

870
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,790
collection a lot of people are getting

871
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,680
that update within the same week and so

872
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,670
that's important to recognize that and

873
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,710
probably those are routine updates then

874
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,570
file sizes can matter also sometimes

875
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,000
they're there certain file sizes we saw

876
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:59,180
a lot of in the corpus because there are

877
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,849
some fixed format files so if you see

878
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,950
those they're probably uninteresting

879
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:05,359
then Contagion if we've already found

880
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:09,439
that most of the files in the directory

881
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,690
are uninteresting based on the above

882
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,460
methods then probably any remaining

883
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:16,520
files in that directory are also

884
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,180
uninteresting by contagion with the ones

885
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,359
that are there

886
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,098
then there's paths that are from known

887
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:23,690
uninteresting directory sometimes we

888
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,180
just have to make up a list of things

889
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,210
that are uninteresting and including

890
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,540
some files - a classic example that is

891
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,700
the jihad handbook there's a file that

892
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,230
it's that the sponsor has found many

893
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,970
times in the Middle East which is

894
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:42,830
basically instructions on how to build

895
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:45,770
bombs and create havoc and in countries

896
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,930
and blow up bridges and interesting

897
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,820
things like that so when they find that

898
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,339
that's quite

899
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,320
interesting so we need to have some

900
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:57,180
lists of some interesting directories as

901
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,310
well as uninteresting ones but on the

902
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,259
hand if it's a game file if it's game

903
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,000
directory we're probably not interested

904
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,650
in that and there are quite a lot of

905
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,970
game directories as you expect in this

906
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,530
collection where we've just gone around

907
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,709
the world and bought people's old

908
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,359
computers same thing with extension some

909
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,940
extensions we know are associated with

910
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:17,190
games so we don't care about those so

911
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,220
here's some examples here's some same

912
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,810
hash files you can see that the hashes

913
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,240
can be quite helpful because there are

914
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,339
all these different names for the same

915
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,810
contents sometimes there's different

916
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,630
names for the same contents because

917
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,820
there are different languages and but

918
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,430
they basically mean the same thing so we

919
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,839
want to recognize all the hash codes

920
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,490
will allow us to recognize the same

921
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,950
contents under a different name or

922
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,200
different paths and then here's some of

923
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:47,009
the same paths different files with the

924
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,560
same path their bottom level directory

925
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:51,390
Oh similar sort of thing busy times on

926
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,490
the drive we found a lot of things for

927
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,440
instance on one particular indian drive

928
00:37:53,490 --> 00:38:00,080
great and on one particular day in one

929
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,520
particular time and so that's often a

930
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,140
useful thing too as a clue that is

931
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,119
probably not interesting because that

932
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,089
was probably a software installation now

933
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,420
here's a graph of the of the entire

934
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:18,060
corpus over a set of weeks there in the

935
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,339
I forget what time a particularly set of

936
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,799
time there BOSU you can see there's

937
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:25,770
clearly a huge peak here at this one

938
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,369
particular week and so that's clearly a

939
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:32,759
Microsoft update so any files we've got

940
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:34,589
in that time period are probably related

941
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,540
to the update course we'll have to check

942
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:38,190
you know there'll have to be other clues

943
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,589
that's why we have the two out of nine

944
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,890
criteria so we can find those kinds of

945
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:46,529
things but anyway we can clearly see

946
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,270
there's quite a lot of variation in the

947
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,030
amount of activity in our corpus as a

948
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,320
function of a week of the year and we

949
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,250
should take that into account and

950
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,140
deciding it's uninteresting or not

951
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:01,230
frequent sizes there's a lot of files

952
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,879
with size 16 91 for some reason so it

953
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,600
seemed we're not sure exactly what they

954
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,990
were but they

955
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,330
seems to be a standard format type thing

956
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,669
and here's some contagion examples

957
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,430
here's some examples of some software

958
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,230
files that we found in the directories

959
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,569
they were in and so we can recognize

960
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,030
these directories and exclude anything

961
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,740
from those directories a lot of that was

962
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,230
done manually we had to go through and

963
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,270
figure this out and then we have some

964
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,240
file extensions that we know are injury

965
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:33,330
uninteresting

966
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,669
so we'll exclude all these files and so

967
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,560
here's what our results look like we've

968
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:42,180
got a whole bunch of files on our

969
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,980
computer systems that and we've got two

970
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,450
columns here the number of files that

971
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,460
we've got when we apply these methods

972
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,370
and then the number of distinct caches

973
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,310
that we've got so full corpus when we

974
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:56,069
did this test was 260 2.7 million files

975
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:59,370
we apply in srl we can knock that down

976
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,840
to 200 point one we look at the number

977
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,509
distinct hashes it doesn't have as

978
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,870
dramatic effect it only reduces by 6.6

979
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,980
percent for the reason that NS RL

980
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,020
obviously tries to look at the very

981
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,360
common files and that occur many many

982
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,570
times it doesn't have that many distinct

983
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:19,230
hash codes so anyway then we applied our

984
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:21,480
methods on top of NS RL and we got it

985
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,970
down to 20 1.4 percent of the original

986
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,860
number of file so that's a two and a

987
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,410
half times improvement on the number of

988
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,020
files and this is less work for forensic

989
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:33,120
investigators it's less work for your

990
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,759
software that's scanning the drive if

991
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:39,270
you don't have to look at at as many

992
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,190
files if you have to look only at the 35

993
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,560
percent of over 40 percent I guess of

994
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,140
the files that they're on the drive so

995
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,320
that's really impressive we then had to

996
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:52,049
add back some files that are interesting

997
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,080
I'll show you we had six criteria for

998
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:57,750
interesting files that and any caches

999
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,640
that match those we put back in and the

1000
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,290
jihad' handbook would be one example

1001
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,910
that we found the hash code of the

1002
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:08,190
jihad' handbook we we put those back in

1003
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,930
so we got pretty dramatic improvements

1004
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,260
and the adding back the interesting

1005
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,149
files didn't didn't decrease it didn't

1006
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,020
add a whole lot of extra stuff didn't

1007
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,850
didn't hurt our

1008
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,190
results too much so it seems like these

1009
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,080
are these this is a reasonable way to go

1010
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,880
and and it's really going to make an

1011
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,100
impact on our sponsor because the

1012
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,900
sponsor has to do so much data

1013
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,430
processing in such short periods of time

1014
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,070
so here's some examples of the recall

1015
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:39,680
and precision on this particular data

1016
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:45,210
here so precision in this case means of

1017
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,160
all the uninteresting files that it it

1018
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,440
labeled how many of the things had

1019
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,890
called uninteresting or actually

1020
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,460
interesting recall means of all the

1021
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,160
files that it labeled as interesting how

1022
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,660
many of those were really uninteresting

1023
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,569
now if you think about it precision is

1024
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,970
far more important than recall for us

1025
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,060
here as it is for most security

1026
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:11,160
applications because our sponsor doesn't

1027
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,410
want to miss the next 911 doesn't want

1028
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,870
to miss the next terrorist app so if

1029
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,910
they fail to find we fail to find

1030
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,529
something for them that was really

1031
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,629
important in relevant that would be

1032
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,730
really bad so you can see the precision

1033
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,640
values are quite high in the point 99

1034
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,260
range for most of these the the only two

1035
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,279
that are bad are this one here the

1036
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,710
frequent sizes and directory contagion

1037
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,380
the contagion one they're still not all

1038
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,620
that bad this is 0.98 right this is 0.98

1039
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,650
so you only have a 2% error rate on that

1040
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:47,220
so but anyway that's why we have the two

1041
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,990
out of nine criteria or we try to have

1042
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,899
more than one clue before we decide

1043
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:57,919
something is uninteresting let me go

1044
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:01,530
back here ah yeah so anyway the the

1045
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,210
recall isn't all that great though so

1046
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,830
for instance the recall varies quite a

1047
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,270
bit on these types of things and what

1048
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,450
this means is we're getting a lot of

1049
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,310
false alarms and we're getting maybe

1050
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,279
half false alarms on these types of

1051
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:16,200
things but if you're familiar at all

1052
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,090
with intrusion detection systems they

1053
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,089
get a lot of false alarms and intrusion

1054
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,650
detection systems and so that's sort of

1055
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,240
an acceptable part of a lot of

1056
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,270
information security that you're going

1057
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,879
to have a significant rate of false

1058
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,800
alarms at least this is only 50% Allah

1059
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:37,740
of intrusion detection data that I've

1060
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:39,480
seen has like a finds like hundred times

1061
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:44,129
more false alarms than legitimate

1062
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,200
attacks on some of their systems so I

1063
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,120
think this is acceptable performance for

1064
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,430
the system and we're trying to implement

1065
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,230
this by the way right now so that you

1066
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,370
know I built a prototype for the sponsor

1067
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,990
and they're now they've now got a

1068
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,580
contractor is trying to build them a

1069
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,390
production system so we can actually

1070
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:02,670
test this out and see how it works

1071
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:05,009
here's the interesting file clues now

1072
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:08,220
interesting file is the stuff we put

1073
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,860
back in once we've we've eliminated the

1074
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,319
by the nine clues I just showed you and

1075
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,450
so the only one that worked any good was

1076
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,880
the explicit list of interesting

1077
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,009
extensions or directories so the jihad'

1078
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,340
handbook would be an example that we

1079
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,050
also add things like the sponsor told us

1080
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:30,510
for instance they are very interested in

1081
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:33,510
any software for a permanent erasure of

1082
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,480
files so in other words something that

1083
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,910
writes over with zeros and ones random

1084
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,310
patterns of the data so that you can't

1085
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,200
see what was originally there I'm sure

1086
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,330
you all know that if you delete a file

1087
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,100
it doesn't make it go away and that's

1088
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,230
always been a great thing for digital

1089
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,480
forensics as we can see a lot of deleted

1090
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,860
files and see what people were doing

1091
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,690
with the deleted files and we got a lot

1092
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,450
of deleted files in our corpus that we

1093
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,250
can read so anyway we're interested in

1094
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,770
the ratio we're interested in anything

1095
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,660
that involves like penetration testing

1096
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:07,710
we're interested in anything that you

1097
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,660
use to encrypt or are encode things so

1098
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,550
generally encryption software that's not

1099
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,799
standard encryption software is very

1100
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,570
interesting there's a particular package

1101
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,350
that's used a lot in the Middle East of

1102
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:21,720
encryption software and so people are

1103
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:25,020
often using that one and so we use that

1104
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,609
anyway other methods that inconsistency

1105
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,480
between the extension and the magic

1106
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:32,490
number analysis you often see this in

1107
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,800
forensic tools but we didn't it didn't

1108
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:37,229
show to be too too helpful there were

1109
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,460
just too many false alarms and then

1110
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,990
there were other things like hashes

1111
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,550
occurring only once for a given tap

1112
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,259
paths occurring only once per given hash

1113
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,360
and those turned out to be good

1114
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,690
nonetheless I want to keep all six of

1115
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,370
these criteria because even though we

1116
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,230
didn't find him in our corpus if we're

1117
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,049
dealing with data that's where people

1118
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,120
are being deliberately deceptive you

1119
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,920
will find these things more often people

1120
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,990
really going to efforts to be deceptive

1121
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,240
I've written a book that was published

1122
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:06,279
in 2016 called introduction to cyber

1123
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,020
deception so I do a lot of work also on

1124
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,520
cyber deception if you're interested you

1125
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:13,780
can see some of my analysis with that

1126
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,320
okay that's all I had to say any

1127
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,320
questions

1128
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:31,460
hi Neil greet talk um I wonder if you

1129
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:35,330
have done kress across validation in the

1130
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:39,320
first task where you you try to find

1131
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:42,770
like what are the places where this

1132
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:46,640
malware will be installed because if you

1133
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:48,800
have the data set of all the malware you

1134
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,470
probably can do simple static analysis

1135
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,810
for example you can just use grab to get

1136
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:55,910
all the directories and then you can

1137
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,220
have a list of directories and I wonder

1138
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,430
if you have done some you know cross

1139
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,959
checking between the the list of

1140
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,240
directories you can find from the

1141
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,950
malware and the the interesting

1142
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,009
directories you can find from the

1143
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:12,259
machine learning method you know I'm not

1144
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,480
sure exactly what you're asking here

1145
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:18,710
you're you're talking about the first

1146
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,330
project right yes because I wonder if

1147
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,150
after your first project and you

1148
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:25,910
probably can point out like what are the

1149
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:29,080
most interesting like directories a

1150
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:32,180
malware wants to install right you know

1151
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:38,150
so I assume you have a list of interest

1152
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:40,460
in directories you have for malware well

1153
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,890
all we can do is rate the rate them is

1154
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:46,040
to the various categories they are we

1155
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:47,990
have a hierarchy of directories so we

1156
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,000
classify directories so we use that

1157
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:54,200
classification to decide if something is

1158
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,720
interesting or not yes because then you

1159
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,060
have a list of directories which are

1160
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,279
interested because those are the places

1161
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:05,029
where malware are likely to getting

1162
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,070
solved right well we have categories we

1163
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,870
have categories of directories but it

1164
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:11,180
was the third project with which is the

1165
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,650
one that had a list of directories the

1166
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,890
first project did not have a list of

1167
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:18,070
directories

1168
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:20,230
oh okay I see because I was asking if

1169
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,990
you have a list of directories then you

1170
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,240
probably could do cross-validation with

1171
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,370
the list of directories you can find

1172
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,370
using static analysis from the malware

1173
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,020
data set yeah right yeah that would be

1174
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,480
the hope I basically just did the first

1175
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,860
step in trying to find malware and

1176
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,250
there's a lot of more things you can do

1177
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,250
after that

1178
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,460
gotcha thank you

1179
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,509
okay looks like we have a question here

1180
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:52,160
from DJ I'm going to VJ I'm going to

1181
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:53,869
unmute your mic I'm hi Neil uh it was a

1182
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,049
great talk so I just have a small

1183
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:59,029
question um are these identification

1184
00:48:57,049 --> 00:49:01,579
tools which you used and compared like

1185
00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:03,769
open share bit nine and via show did you

1186
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:07,309
judge them to be the best in the market

1187
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:09,499
at what they do well they're what we

1188
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:11,630
could afford mainly you know we're

1189
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:14,660
researchers so we don't have access to

1190
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:17,599
some of the really fancy stuff that some

1191
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:20,269
organizations have I am honored so we

1192
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,950
they were just a sample virus share is

1193
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:24,439
pretty well accepted so a lot of people

1194
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:27,558
are using virus share Symantec is the

1195
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,099
one that's mandated for our school so we

1196
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:33,019
we had to do something with that one and

1197
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:35,180
but as I saw you know there's lots of

1198
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:36,769
weaknesses in Symantec you know I mean

1199
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,078
there were lots of interesting files

1200
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:42,558
that Symantec didn't flag that bit 9 was

1201
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:44,329
sure were malicious and malicious in the

1202
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,400
top level you know bit 9 has several

1203
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:48,229
different levels of maliciousness and so

1204
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,359
there were some that fit 9 was really

1205
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:54,019
sure about where malware that Symantec

1206
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:59,690
didn't find it all ok ok ok thank you so

1207
00:49:54,019 --> 00:50:02,799
much hey Mike can you and mute Jack

1208
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,799
simmers wine please

1209
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:11,308
go ahead jack hi I just had a question

1210
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:14,130
you were talking about how you'd find a

1211
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:16,410
lot of game files and I know that

1212
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,470
there's a big trend to terrorist

1213
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:22,999
community or communicating over game

1214
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:26,759
consoles and using that kind of as a

1215
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:31,019
obscured medium to prevent forensic

1216
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:33,059
tools is there a process that you guys

1217
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:37,288
see in the field when working with that

1218
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:41,400
to extract that information yeah so we

1219
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:43,619
really need to rerun our our testing to

1220
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,690
see if that's happening with some new

1221
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,970
drives to see if we find some instance

1222
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:51,079
out and that may change our opinion of

1223
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,078
game directories

1224
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:58,310
still a lot of gaming records have files

1225
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,439
that are not going to be interesting and

1226
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:02,759
you know there's going to be executable

1227
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
x' and things like that there will be

1228
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,050
configuration files it'll only be a few

1229
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,060
files within the game directories that

1230
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:13,820
could possibly be interesting that we

1231
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,820
need to to maybe re-examine

1232
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,620
to have more questions

1233
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:43,078
you

1234
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,650
