1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090
my grandmother watch good afternoon and

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,740
welcome to this week's edition of the

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,440
serious security seminar from Purdue

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,839
University our speaker today is dr. John

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,270
Fatima he's a manager of data analysis

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,369
and exploitation department at sandia

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,740
national laboratories and he supervises

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,990
a department specializing in signal and

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,028
image processing also proud to say that

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,580
John got his PhD in electrical

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,980
engineering here at Purdue University

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:38,399
welcome John thank you so I'm going to

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,199
talk about the evaluation of urban

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,090
vehicle tracking algorithms this may not

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,739
be exactly a tie to secure cybersecurity

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,300
like your thinking but I think that

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,820
there is some parallels that I'd like

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,788
you to think about where as we're

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,550
looking at and interested in trying to

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,649
find multiple vehicles over as shown in

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,078
the left there's a road map and this

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,019
happens to be Socorro New Mexico on the

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,420
right is an image taken from sandia peak

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,729
looking down at Albuquerque and hundreds

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,939
of cars that are moving at night and

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,850
trying to detect and track those cars at

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,529
a resolution where you don't have what

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,720
what usually is called enough pixels on

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,000
target to distinguish the cars but you

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,939
get glimpses of the cars you get maybe a

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,220
car shows up you know in a pixel or two

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,869
because we've got probably one to two

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,210
meter resolution in this particular

34
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,680
image and so the difficulty gets to be

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,860
you get instances of somebody moving in

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,170
this environment you get observations

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,400
and you've got to go and predict what

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,530
they're doing now I guess the

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,630
cybersecurity parallel would be you're

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,970
looking at a network intrusion sort of

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,079
applications and how would you apply

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,820
some machine learning algorithms or you

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,399
know signal image processing algorithms

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,860
to determine where that intruder is

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,259
moving through your network so kind of

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,380
think of this as as in that parallel

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,299
sense to you know try to visualize how

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,649
maybe some of the same sort of ideas or

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,790
algorithms could be applied to a

50
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:16,170
security network application okay

51
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,209
so in general Sandhya does do work in

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,149
the area of nuclear non-proliferation

53
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,760
and we do have satellite systems that we

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,650
work on and in general my department

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,590
does detection tracking classification

56
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,180
so a lot of this work is related to this

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,379
idea of how do you scale up detection

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,359
when you've got a large number of

59
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,899
detections and tracking objects that

60
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:42,389
you've got to look at ok so I'm going to

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,730
switch before well ok let's go to the

62
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:48,470
next slide so the difficult part with

63
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,629
this tracking application is really

64
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,239
there's two kind of on two extremes on

65
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,340
one extreme you've got where we do just

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,709
blob detection you look at just a blob

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,599
and how it's moving and if it's a single

68
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,250
pixel it's usually easy like a pacman

69
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,530
sort of thing to follow a single pixel

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,500
moving in an environment the difficulty

71
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,060
gets to be when you get noise and you're

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,680
looking at objects that are very low

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,099
signal and noise or racial mean they're

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,900
just barely above the the noise the dark

75
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,698
current noise and the sensors and things

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,220
like that on the other extreme you've

77
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,709
got physical security applications where

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,510
you may have Miami have cameras here

79
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,250
looking at all of you and I may be able

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,569
to track every one of you moving around

81
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,519
in this environment and one of the

82
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,828
reasons I'm able to do that is because I

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,959
get many pixels on target I can

84
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,540
distinguish you're not just a blob to me

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,879
and I can see the whole shape I can do

86
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,319
the association from one blink of an eye

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,030
to the next blink of an eye and I can

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,470
see not only where you were in the

89
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,150
previous frame i can see you in the next

90
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,159
frame and i can distinguish i'm at the

91
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,190
same time doing the facial recognition

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,019
that says where you are so you have the

93
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,120
two extremes one is I've got lots of

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,799
pixel on target 1 i've got only one

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,629
pixel on target and what we're

96
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,400
interested here in this urban tracking

97
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,108
is somewhere in between you might get a

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,750
few more pixels on target but we still

99
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,799
don't have enough to have lots of pixels

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,680
on target where you can do

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,139
discrimination easily then you've got

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,419
the other problem of occlusion overlaps

103
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,040
and you know vehicles that come in and

104
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,259
out of focus because again they're

105
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,440
they're low signal annoys if we're

106
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,659
looking up on top of sandia peak over 3

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,659
miles looking down at a bunch of cars

108
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:25,599
and the cars move and turn you sometimes

109
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,159
get a glimpse of their head

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,960
lights you sometimes don't get a glimpse

111
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,490
of their headlights and so you you've

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,469
got to take into account the fact that

113
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,610
you might see it one instant and then

114
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,840
you get several frames where you don't

115
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,490
see it and then you've got to see it the

116
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,919
next instance and when you've got two

117
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,710
cars that are crossing how do you deal

118
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,690
with that or multiple cars going in in

119
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,060
parallel or maybe one going past the

120
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,710
other how do you associate one that one

121
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,820
car passed the other how do you

122
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,560
associate and then the other problem is

123
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,780
we typically when we're tracking objects

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,850
we use some sort of model or dynamics of

125
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,010
the object usually a common filters is

126
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,780
the approach most people take common

127
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,610
filters are great if you got a nice

128
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,890
continuous motion if I'm looking at a

129
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,500
missile trajectory a nice continuous

130
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,900
motion is common filters are perfect for

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,940
that cars though traffic starts and

132
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,489
stops and so that's a very difficult

133
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,990
problem so how do you do how do you deal

134
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,460
with the fact that not everything moves

135
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,590
at a constant velocity there's

136
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,359
acceleration starts and stops there's a

137
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,929
right-hand turns how do you deal with

138
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:31,050
all of that I'm going to switch to I

139
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,050
wanted to show you one other slide here

140
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:47,140
and I head up just a minute ago so this

141
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,500
this diagram here shows the typical sort

142
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,320
of detection and tracking diagram of how

143
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,010
this is done so you can see that that

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,890
block block that says raw sensor data

145
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:03,180
that is the raw sensor data of say some

146
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:05,710
CCD like camera looking down at say

147
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,630
Albuquerque and what we typically do is

148
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,880
we take the current frame and we

149
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,400
subtract off a background estimate of

150
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,310
what's behind or what's the normal scene

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
so think of if I had a bicycle going

152
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,940
through an environment and I might pick

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,110
first take a picture of the scene before

154
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,700
the bicycle moves through the

155
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,230
environment and then I take a picture as

156
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,360
the bicycle moves through and I take the

157
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,910
current frame minus that previous frame

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,800
then I get just the bicycle hopefully

159
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,930
and not the rest of that environment it

160
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,860
be subtracted off that background

161
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,270
estimate though there's a lot of

162
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,440
different techniques for doing that

163
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,450
we're not really going to discuss that

164
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,210
here there's all sorts of like an

165
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,979
infinite impulse response filter or some

166
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,299
what's called a fast approximate power

167
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,950
iteration over the more you're doing

168
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,340
singular value decomposition on the

169
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,900
image but the fact is we get a change in

170
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,820
where were these first two blocks

171
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,140
between the raw sensor data and the

172
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,900
background estimation are doing a

173
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,880
background change detection process that

174
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,690
then is then you're going to go to this

175
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,860
next box that's going to do a threshold

176
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,780
attentions out that are above a certain

177
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,730
threshold they could be the actual

178
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,039
object you're tracking or they could be

179
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,890
noise they could be things like because

180
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,890
of the camera is sitting on top of this

181
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,750
you know Peaks a mile up and there might

182
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,490
be wind and breeze moving it around you

183
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,950
might get a little jitter in your camera

184
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,900
motion you might get noise associated

185
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,210
with just blinking of the city lights

186
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,280
and you got to take into account all of

187
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,780
that the main part i'm going to talk

188
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,479
about in this presentation is the lower

189
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,450
right which is the how do you do the

190
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,610
observation you know observation to

191
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,070
track association how do you do the

192
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,900
gating gating is if i've seen it in one

193
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,420
frame and i moved to the next frame I

194
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,000
expect it to move a little bit but be

195
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,800
approximately here and I put a gate or a

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,660
circle around it and I say well if

197
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,810
anything

198
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,460
observes in the next circle then I think

199
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,050
that that's the same object that I saw

200
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,080
in the previous frame so that's a gate

201
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,090
then I do a prediction and filtering

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,890
that's usually a common filter that says

203
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,409
where it's moving next and then I do

204
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,140
track maintenance which does either a

205
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,380
whole new object or a car moved into the

206
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,150
scene or that card just turned off its

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,080
lights and no it's no longer in the

208
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,460
scene so you got this initiation

209
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,990
confirmation that it's still there or

210
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,630
deletion so I'm going to be talking

211
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:31,890
mainly about that lower right box set of

212
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:36,000
boxes now going back to this

213
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,979
presentation so so what I'm going to

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,240
talk about is a couple of things I'm

215
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,010
first going to talk about the three

216
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,390
datasets that we collected data from and

217
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,400
then I'm going to spend most of my time

218
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,740
on these for tracking algorithms that we

219
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,770
evaluated talk a little bit about the

220
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,080
evaluation metrics and the results and

221
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,640
again I think if you look at these

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,530
algorithms they could be used for

223
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,420
network security so there's ransack

224
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,120
algorithm it's a very popular algorithm

225
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,689
goes back to the 80s and it's a way of

226
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,700
removing statistical outliers and then

227
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,810
using a least squares fit of those

228
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,570
things that are outside of the

229
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,770
statistical outliers to say you know

230
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,960
that's the model that you're tracking

231
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,569
the proximity tracking algorithm is if

232
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,990
our own home brew algorithm Monte Carlo

233
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:22,020
our Markov chain Monte Carlo data

234
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,790
Association Markov chain Monte Carlo

235
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,199
techniques are used throughout computer

236
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,550
science so you could definitely use this

237
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,610
technique for a network sort of

238
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,490
application track load inference factor

239
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,960
graphs are a bayesian graph approach

240
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,420
basically a network approach and so

241
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,200
again this probably could be applied to

242
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,880
a cyber security problem so the data

243
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,330
sets that we had though the one in the

244
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,460
lower left is again these city lights

245
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,260
looking at Albuquerque from up at the

246
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:55,830
Sandia Peak the one in the middle is

247
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,540
this we use a sumo simulation simulator

248
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,880
that's out freeware out on the net and

249
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,730
we simulated 780 vehicles moving around

250
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
the video of the Albuquerque we only by

251
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,960
hand picked out 11 vehicles that we

252
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,520
truth there were hundreds of other

253
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,340
vehicles that were in that scene but

254
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,500
only 11 that we truth we use the

255
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,030
simulator 2 it's always hard to get

256
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,770
ground truth and what is really moving

257
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,600
through the scenes so the simulator was

258
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,210
a way of testing the tracking algorithms

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,580
without getting it mixed up with all

260
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,280
sorts of other noise another data set

261
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,760
that we looked on the far right is air

262
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,650
force research labs at wright-patterson

263
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,660
had a UAV flying over three different

264
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,610
areas of interests or regions of

265
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,640
interest that's shown over here and they

266
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,250
had ground truth data on 60 to 100 cars

267
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,199
and so we use that data as well to try

268
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,020
to ground truth these three four

269
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,930
different algorithms so I'm going to

270
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,350
start off by talking about the ransack

271
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,670
technique so all of these techniques

272
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,470
require some sort of motion models so

273
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,390
this is the dynamics of the system and

274
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,510
the easiest thing to do is assume a

275
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,650
linear dynamic system so you got looking

276
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:08,050
in the next Y plane you've got a

277
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,329
constant velocity mile that says how is

278
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,150
this move at x1 is your initial point

279
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,550
times the velocity times the change in

280
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,040
time how far is it moved ok so we just

281
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,810
got this constant velocity model and if

282
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,390
you're familiar with common filters you

283
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,760
use that plus you add some sort of white

284
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,470
Gaussian noise to it and then you use

285
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,050
the common filter to weigh your

286
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,300
observations based on how good you think

287
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,069
the observations are versus how good you

288
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,859
think this model is and so you're

289
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,320
optimally Wayne the observations versus

290
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,800
how fast the model is moving the ransack

291
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,190
method uses this model and so it's going

292
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:50,079
to look at the residual error associated

293
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,700
with using this model and randomly fit

294
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,710
this model to a bunch of points I'm

295
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,240
going to show it in a picture in the

296
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,160
next frame so you'll kind of get an idea

297
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,140
but it basically is going to take two

298
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,600
points you get these two observations

299
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,939
and says ok well let's look at those two

300
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
points and if that's a track if i only

301
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,330
have those two points well it's maybe

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,370
not a track if i get a bunch of points

303
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,660
in between which are the in liars then i

304
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,940
might think that's a track because i've

305
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,120
seen this same object moving along a

306
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,670
straight line on this

307
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,100
in velocity model okay so I'm going to

308
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,479
look for in liars in the model and if

309
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,760
I've got a sufficient number i'm going

310
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,170
to say that's a track okay and then i

311
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,560
can repeat this for a number of

312
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:32,329
iterations so this this movie kind of

313
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,069
shows the idea so first it's showing

314
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,630
okay let's here's the number of tracks

315
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,460
so here's a bunch of tracks some of

316
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,890
these are noise some of these are real

317
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,020
tracks making a motion so you can see on

318
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,350
the left hand side you can see that

319
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,480
there's kind of a straight line that's a

320
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,830
constant velocity model some of these on

321
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,660
the right though the objects are moving

322
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,910
in a curved line so it probably wouldn't

323
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,370
find those as being single tracks it

324
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,219
would find those as being maybe segments

325
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,870
of a track ransacked by itself though is

326
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,490
only figuring out one of those and I

327
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,660
picked the one you can see that it

328
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,940
picked the one that had highlighted

329
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,529
there and now it's going through and

330
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,779
finding it again so it's doing a

331
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,700
sequential ransack over the more it

332
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,200
finds one straight line set emotions

333
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,760
then it goes looks at combinations of

334
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,540
others to try to find another

335
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,730
straight-line motion and so I believe

336
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:24,529
this thing goes on and on trying to do

337
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:28,279
these combinations there's another one

338
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:31,040
that it and so here's the here's the few

339
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,080
that it found so it found this one that

340
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,640
you can see that's over on the left the

341
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,470
one that's a straight one over on the

342
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,290
right at a diagonal and then these two

343
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,490
that are kind of curved but those I

344
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,520
think it thinks they're kind of

345
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:46,220
individual tracks not groups of tracks

346
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,880
so the next thing we did was to look at

347
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,680
a variation on that so we use this so

348
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,080
with a regular ransack it would find

349
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,420
individual straight line tracks and what

350
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,700
we wanted to do was merge that or have

351
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,500
this match sequential ransack that would

352
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,230
go and combine what we would call the

353
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,330
track let which is the sequence of

354
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,830
points shown in red here with maybe

355
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,990
another sequence of points that's going

356
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:14,320
to be the curved points that shows where

357
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,320
you're following the object so

358
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,730
so that's that's the the other thing

359
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,400
that we've done is with this this match

360
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,960
sequential ransack it'll find not only

361
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,490
these straight lines but it will find

362
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,410
the curves as well okay so now the the

363
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,630
advantage of this is it's kind of a

364
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,810
single motion model but the

365
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:41,410
disadvantages is that not many people

366
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,900
drive it at constant velocity the multi

367
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,770
ransack allows for the curve allows for

368
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,360
some combination of the track 'let's you

369
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,250
can imagine though you can see how long

370
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,110
it took just to go through those it's

371
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,450
kind of inefficient it's random you're

372
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,580
just randomly picking these the nice

373
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,410
thing about the ransack is it does for

374
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,660
example it took a bunch of points but it

375
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,150
took a bunch of other points and so it

376
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,380
really looks for the cluster of points

377
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,480
that are going to have that constant

378
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,860
velocity model throws out all the other

379
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,050
love outliers so it's very

380
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,730
computationally efficient we've used

381
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,550
this same algorithm for insane

382
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,140
registration if you've got one image and

383
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,449
you want to align it with another image

384
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,090
you take all of these fiducial points in

385
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,190
both images and you try to line them up

386
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,350
even if you've got occlusions the

387
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,510
ransack will find groups of those

388
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,090
fiducial points to do the matching

389
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,890
between those tights and leave the

390
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,410
others behind so the ransack is really a

391
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:39,130
very simple algorithm but but actually

392
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:43,000
very powerful the downside is is that

393
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,470
it's computationally intensive the next

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,590
thing we did this was kind of our own

395
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,420
little algorithm so you know our concern

396
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,340
about the complex emotion not just a

397
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,099
linear motion said well maybe we should

398
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,170
just look at a proximity tracker that

399
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,120
says we're going to form two pairs of

400
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,709
detections that are close by and then

401
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,940
we're going to look for overlaps of

402
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,740
those and then we're going to form these

403
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,110
track let's to try to smooth between it

404
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,160
so rather than doing the random

405
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,840
combination of pairing and then looking

406
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,329
for the in liars we're just going to

407
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,640
merge these together as shown here so

408
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,490
even if you had two vehicles moving in

409
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,130
opposite directions as shown on the left

410
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,110
it would combine one with two and two or

411
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,420
three so when it combines one with two

412
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,880
it says I'm moving at this velocity then

413
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,560
it looks at at the points around it so

414
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,140
it might look at point three and point

415
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
three shown there and the reason it

416
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,620
might choose

417
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,139
three in the red or the point number

418
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,000
three in the red rather than the green

419
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,709
is because it's moving at a constant

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,230
velocity it's not going to take a left

421
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:43,300
hand turn as shown there in the red and

422
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,009
the same thing with the green ones so

423
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,800
it'll try to maintain that constant

424
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:49,480
velocity just by using its proximity to

425
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,699
the next one same thing if they're

426
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,709
moving in parallel again it would

427
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,930
probably maintain the track in the red

428
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,670
and in the green because it's not going

429
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,099
to try to deviate from that straight

430
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,079
line path you can see though that there

431
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,430
are problems there and and when I show

432
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,319
you the results you're going to see that

433
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,089
this algorithm doesn't do very well if

434
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,369
you've got parallel traffic moving

435
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:12,208
together because it gets confused very

436
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:16,289
easily with a slight deviation in the

437
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:19,209
tour check tree emotion of the objects

438
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:22,089
but we have applied this it's low

439
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,500
computational does best for the isolated

440
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,510
vehicles doesn't do well with the

441
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,320
parallel traffic this is the socorro

442
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,580
example where it's tracked a bunch of

443
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,590
different vehicles all colored in

444
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,090
different colors here and how those

445
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,939
vehicles are moving through the

446
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,289
environment the next one these are these

447
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,000
are a little more difficult so this

448
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:44,890
gives to the Markov chain Monte Carlo

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,900
Association method and so this first set

450
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,750
of this first equation is is you're

451
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,169
probably familiar with Bayes rule and so

452
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,880
you've got a a posterior probability

453
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:59,049
which is on the left and that's

454
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:04,120
proportional to the a priori probability

455
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:05,889
which is this P sub Omega and then

456
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,620
you've got this conditional probability

457
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,120
and so you've got you're really saying

458
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,158
that the probability of a track

459
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,379
association given an observation is

460
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,049
proportional to the probability of the

461
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,289
observation given the track association

462
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,299
times the probability of that track

463
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,549
association in the first place so

464
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:30,250
anyways that that last term on the right

465
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:33,280
is really is determined I'm going to

466
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:37,150
have to move ahead that that one on the

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,418
right is kind of determined by this this

468
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,220
function this F which is a function of

469
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,430
the probability of detection probability

470
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,870
of a death of

471
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:49,250
object meaning that if no longer is

472
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:51,080
there the probability kind of a Poisson

473
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,300
distribution of the birth and an object

474
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,600
might occur and the Poisson distribution

475
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,909
of a false alarm so that probability on

476
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,919
the far right is the function of those

477
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,230
terms the one that's in the middle

478
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,540
though this conditional probability of

479
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,910
the observation given the track

480
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,030
association is again a common filter so

481
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:15,440
a common common constant velocity common

482
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,660
filter provides that result and then the

483
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,640
the five objects over here on the right

484
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,810
are the different things that could

485
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,940
happen so you know Monte Carlo or Markov

486
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:30,980
decision Markov chains you're usually

487
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,690
saying okay how do I go from one state

488
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,790
to another state and there's a

489
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,160
probability that I'm going to go from

490
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,220
this state to the next state to the next

491
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,740
state well there's ten states that are

492
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,530
defined over here on the right those ten

493
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,350
states are the birth so if I go on that

494
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,420
top one it's if I started with the set

495
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,090
of images on or oh so that set of

496
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,220
detections that are on the left then the

497
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,980
birth which is the red ones that are a

498
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,230
new set of detections how would i if

499
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,300
would those all be associated as one

500
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,760
track so that's the birth the death is

501
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,700
just the opposite the next one down is a

502
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,180
split so what's the probability that if

503
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,160
i have the detections on the left what's

504
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,900
the probability that those could be

505
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,820
really two separate set of detections

506
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,030
and so there's a probability associated

507
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,610
with that so the Markov chain part of

508
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,730
this is these transition matrices that

509
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,070
allow you to do kind of your next

510
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,960
estimate of what you think the track

511
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,490
would be so you combine basically the

512
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,140
Markov chain method with a common filter

513
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,220
within this a priori probability that

514
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,960
things are you know dying or being

515
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,410
observed or dying off so it's this

516
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,620
complex merge of all of these things so

517
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,770
the end result is that this techniques

518
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,830
works fairly well it's flexible in that

519
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,170
you continue doing this so this

520
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,080
technique is actually fairly well you

521
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,640
something like this is used in particle

522
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,530
filters if you're familiar with particle

523
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,120
filters this is what the folks that are

524
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,580
doing autonomous driving of cars are

525
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,739
doing there rather than a common filter

526
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,050
which estimates the state they take a

527
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,510
bunch of particles and they let pub

528
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,360
those particles basically propagate so

529
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,710
if i come to an intersection then some

530
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,870
of those particles are going to go off

531
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,310
to the right on the intersection some of

532
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,850
them are going to go straight and you

533
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,399
compute this you know this map which is

534
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,990
the maximum a posterior probability and

535
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,270
you choose the one that eventually

536
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,950
maximizes that probability so the same

537
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,620
sort of technique applies towards

538
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,900
autonomous driving vehicles so this is

539
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,580
kind of that same Monte Carlo sort of

540
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,410
technique but applied towards multi

541
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,810
vehicle tracking there are some a lot of

542
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:51,170
coefficients like the selected birth

543
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:54,830
death and detection rates so that the

544
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,390
system is a pure statistician doesn't

545
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,460
necessarily like this technique because

546
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,650
there's a lot of fudge factor variables

547
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,900
in it and so you do have to play with

548
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:08,420
those to make this work so that's one of

549
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:10,250
the down sides of this technique the

550
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,970
last technique is this track that

551
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,120
interference technique from factor

552
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,450
graphs and so this is very similar to a

553
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,969
a Bayesian network so the idea is this

554
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,010
first frame at time t0 is the first one

555
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,650
there and suppose that I've got this

556
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,830
detection that it's in blue marked here

557
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,290
and like I said before you want to do an

558
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:36,590
association so at the next frame time t0

559
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,970
plus 1 that same object might have moved

560
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,290
to any one of these three positions okay

561
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,570
so think of this as your cyber security

562
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,639
problem you've got some sort of

563
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,700
detection in your network at one point

564
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,500
you go to time t0 plus 1 and you've got

565
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,760
maybe some detections in another place

566
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,860
and you want to know where somebody is

567
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,110
traveling through your network same sort

568
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,810
of idea could be applied there you

569
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,260
basically have to maximize your a prior

570
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,510
a posterior probability and you can have

571
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,540
a Bayesian network that goes in and

572
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:11,440
expands upon this so the next frame that

573
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,120
same object you can see how it fans out

574
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,340
probably goes to these other points so

575
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,129
the idea here then is let's associate a

576
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,830
probability in your Bayesian network and

577
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:26,660
then try to figure out your maximum a

578
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:28,850
prior or maximum a posterior path

579
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,060
because eventually this can grow this

580
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:34,100
can grow and factorial and explode or

581
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,250
you can prune the tree based on your

582
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:41,449
maximum trying to maximize that

583
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,520
probability ok so this technique also

584
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,680
you can you can use to combine track

585
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,620
'let's so it can it's actually very good

586
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,080
at at finding you know fairly straight

587
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,419
lines again it uses a common filter it

588
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,850
really combines when it makes that

589
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,180
conditional probability that goes from T

590
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:02,030
0 to 0 plus 1 it's combining not only

591
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:06,110
that common filter estimate it also

592
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:07,700
combines what we would call the

593
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,500
recognition next thing I want to

594
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,940
remember when I said that the more

595
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,670
pixels you've got the more you can

596
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,650
recognize an object so if say the shape

597
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,840
of the object at T 0 and the shape of

598
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,840
the object at T 0 plus 1 was the same

599
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,970
you would more associate that than if

600
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,040
the shape had changed right so you think

601
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,530
the shape is the same and so you think

602
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,649
that object is moving in that direction

603
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,860
so so the comments are that the

604
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,650
appearance in motion characteristics

605
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,780
that appearance part wasn't in the

606
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,790
previous ones and so if you use the

607
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,100
appearance and if you get more pixels on

608
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,010
target that can help you a lot in terms

609
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,419
of figuring out where the real track was

610
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,490
and the motion characteristics is again

611
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,520
the common filter in this technique they

612
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,900
kind of get merged together they

613
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,220
multiply the conditional probabilities

614
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:02,750
together it can handle the merging of

615
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:06,110
detections it relies on this maximum a

616
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,540
posterior estimate problem it uses some

617
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,070
other techniques and I've got up if

618
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,540
anybody's interested I've got a paper

619
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,540
that describes all of the work that's

620
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,370
done here and that this last technique

621
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,490
has to first take a bayesian graph

622
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:22,010
convert it to a factor tree which then

623
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,399
gets solved there's some MPE solvers

624
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,289
that you can use

625
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,089
so there's there's software out there

626
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:31,289
that can you you can use to solve this

627
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:34,830
without writing that much yourself so

628
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:35,879
the metrics that we used where I'm

629
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,449
really only going to talk about the

630
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:42,779
first two but the first one is really

631
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,749
one minus those things that that are

632
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:49,139
false like false positives false

633
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:51,179
negatives and identity switches so

634
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,978
ideally in the first one you want the

635
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,719
you want this to be as close to one so

636
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:57,989
you want all those numerator terms on

637
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:59,609
the second one to go to zero and that

638
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,049
will tell you you know how well you're

639
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,239
doing in terms of your tracking so if

640
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,399
you've got lots of false positives these

641
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:07,649
are tracked observations that aren't

642
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,059
really objects so they're just noise and

643
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,949
the environment maybe it's a light that

644
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,239
goes off you know in the scene that

645
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,129
you're looking at and you think it's a

646
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,649
car and it's really not it's just a

647
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:20,939
light that's flickering and false

648
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:23,968
negatives are ones that you missed not

649
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,409
associated associated with the track and

650
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:27,629
then you've got identity switches like

651
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:30,330
if they're crossing and then the next

652
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:32,998
one is another metric is mostly tracked

653
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,158
and so this is the number of targets

654
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:36,299
that are tracked for for more than

655
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,419
eighty percent of the detections

656
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,969
regardless of identity switches so this

657
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,979
chart shows and we've highlighted here

658
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:46,109
in the first two columns those two

659
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,669
metrics and you can see kind of how the

660
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:49,619
different ones perform over the

661
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:53,159
different data sets as I mentioned the

662
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:55,049
socorro is a simulated data set so you

663
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,999
can see the one that provides the best

664
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:59,789
capability as this proximity tracker

665
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:02,159
worked fairly well because there weren't

666
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,539
a lot of cars that were driving side by

667
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:09,119
side the next one the crest remember

668
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,669
there were only 11 objects that were

669
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,379
truth you know says down here in the

670
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,169
lower right only 11 vehicles were

671
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:18,359
actually truth and so there were a lot

672
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:22,859
of other though false alarms that caused

673
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,779
the most this mot a metric to go down so

674
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,658
you can see it didn't do as well but the

675
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,009
other one that was mostly tracted well

676
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,440
and then you can see for the air force

677
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:33,450
research labs that the proximity tracker

678
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,039
did well the factor graph actually did

679
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,870
very well though in the in the bottom

680
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,990
two cases so you can see the factor

681
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,570
graph does pretty well the only one that

682
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,270
didn't do very well on was the crest

683
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:49,080
were there were some issues associated

684
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:54,809
with too much noise and not enough

685
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,550
targets to be tracked and this is an

686
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,770
example of what the movie looks like

687
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,710
from the crest so they're worth

688
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:04,680
following a single target now we're

689
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:08,940
following three targets now one of those

690
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,530
targets is splitting off and so this is

691
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,480
the sort of data that we're trying to

692
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,700
you can see that it lost this one target

693
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,230
at the intersection but it's following

694
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,380
the other three is as they made their

695
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,410
turns ok so again think of that as a

696
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,370
computer network and you've got

697
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,380
intruders that are going through your

698
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,459
intruder network and you might apply

699
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:34,740
these techniques towards towards cyber

700
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:36,929
security as well so in general no was a

701
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,390
clear p rior winner according to the

702
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:41,670
metrics I hope that what you got out of

703
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,650
this presentation was really the use of

704
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,120
ransack again if you haven't heard of

705
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,130
ransack before you probably will

706
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,469
sometime in your career it's used very

707
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,460
often for in scenes and other techniques

708
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:55,500
the Monte Carlo marked the Markov chain

709
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,870
Monte Carlo techniques you surely heard

710
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,130
those or you will hear those those same

711
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:03,149
sort of techniques could apply to

712
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:04,980
towards many other problems there's of

713
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,570
course the more information you have the

714
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,730
better you could always do right so if

715
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,649
color so the Cameron that we head down

716
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,590
looking from the crest was not using

717
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,809
color and so the more you have in terms

718
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,280
of if I had a person who was moving

719
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,928
across and then we're wearing a bright

720
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,490
red hat and they were moving through an

721
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,170
airport environment I could probably see

722
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,059
them fairly well if there were in the

723
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,410
same clothes as everybody else same

724
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,480
colors it's going to be hard to track

725
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,460
them same thing with cars and anything

726
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,620
you're tracking the more distinguishable

727
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,140
of the feature the more you can pull out

728
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,809
that object and then you know the better

729
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,790
your models straight-line constant

730
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:41,840
velocity models are a limiting factor if

731
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:44,010
you have more complex models the

732
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,899
disadvantages the computation goes up

733
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:49,490
the advantages it might do a better job

734
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,490
of tracking maneuvers

735
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,520
okay anybody have any questions

736
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:10,850
yes I wonder well for what it'll be just

737
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:14,419
like tracking the cards maybe for

738
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:17,959
trafficking for so what did they have

739
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:20,450
checked the goal of checking the there

740
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,090
there are actually already systems that

741
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,920
do some tracking of traffic you know for

742
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,240
example the red light monitors you know

743
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,630
when you're getting onto busy

744
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,180
intersections we did this mainly for

745
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,700
looking at potentially out in the future

746
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,610
sensors are getting more and more

747
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,320
resolution you see UAVs and things like

748
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,080
that that are flying around now and

749
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:47,780
people are interested in tracking more

750
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,129
objects whether it's you know areas you

751
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,100
know where we're worried about

752
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,900
terrorists or things like that but we

753
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,169
don't have a specific application we're

754
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,270
pushing the technology right now but for

755
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,070
a lot of our remote sensing we're

756
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,600
interested in not necessarily cars but

757
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,850
other things that we might be tracking

758
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,300
and we want to make sure that we've got

759
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,040
the best available algorithms the

760
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,600
beautiful thing that's happened over the

761
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:17,480
last 20 years is computing gets doubling

762
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,189
every 18 months and so some of the

763
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,810
algorithms that we're using today we

764
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,820
never would have used ten years ago and

765
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:26,659
that's what this is really looking at is

766
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,340
as computing it's bigger you know you've

767
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,720
got more and more capabilities and we've

768
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:34,939
got some systems that have 52 racks of

769
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,760
computing equipment doing image signal

770
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,490
processing sort of algorithms GPUs have

771
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,930
just you know you know quadruple the

772
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,730
number of cores of processing that

773
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:50,110
you've got so you're able to do things

774
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:50,110
you can never could do before yes

775
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,510
this with the GPS location of the cars

776
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,860
and one location and then think about

777
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:01,180
how their map in the cloud or something

778
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,709
yeah I don't know what particular your

779
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,640
application you're thinking of there we

780
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,490
have looked at some things what we call

781
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,410
a constrained velocity matched filter so

782
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,830
if you kind of know where the road is

783
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,330
you know straight and and I think GPS

784
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,100
kind of they have techniques for doing

785
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,350
this right now you can formulate it as

786
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,540
an optimization problem where you're

787
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,689
trying to minimize the error of tracking

788
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,980
along the you know if you think the cars

789
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,770
aren't going off-road and they're going

790
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,850
to stay on the road you can minimize the

791
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:36,550
error of the vehicle on the road and you

792
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,219
know use that to increase your signal

793
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:42,430
the noise okay so it ends up that if

794
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,500
that object is moving one way to

795
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,320
increase your signal the noise is co add

796
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,060
or add up the frames but you've gotta

797
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,240
know kind of the velocity they're moving

798
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,399
at and so you add up those velocities by

799
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,690
adding them together so it's a kind of a

800
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,370
chicken and egg which which do you know

801
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,350
first if you knew the velocity that they

802
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,149
were moving then you could add them up

803
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,169
so that your signal annoys sticks out

804
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,760
further on these so you kind of there's

805
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,710
different techniques for doing that you

806
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,270
can actually kind of do a random search

807
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,710
around where you think there might be

808
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:15,490
something moving at a constant velocity

809
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:17,800
and go and add those up but so anyways

810
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,510
yeah I think there are there are papers

811
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,909
out there where people have looked at

812
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,700
you know combining GPS with the visual

813
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:29,320
tracking and in fact you know some of

814
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:31,870
the robotics areas they use visual

815
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,580
techniques combined with GPS so in

816
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,850
robotics they particularly have a

817
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,590
problem with you know you get gps and

818
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,840
then you go into an urban canyon and the

819
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,760
robotic vehicle doesn't get gps and

820
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,770
starts to drop out and you need to kind

821
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,540
