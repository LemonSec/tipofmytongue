1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:17,570
hello everyone hopefully everyone had a

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,190
good lunch maybe a walk the weather

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,900
continues to get warmer and it's

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,660
supposed to be sunny by the end of the

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:30,448
day so we'll see how that goes this

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,610
afternoon we have a schedule that's a

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,290
little different I'm not sure if it's a

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,730
the same as the printed schedule or not

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,120
we've had to do a little bit of

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,279
rearrangement because of schedules

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,070
normally the next event we would have as

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,039
the last event of the day is a grand way

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,989
to close things out so we're going to

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,829
have a grand way to start the afternoon

15
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:56,480
and please don't go away because we have

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,120
other talks scheduled for the afternoon

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,788
we've talked about security we've talked

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,349
about some issues of emerging threats

19
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,710
we've talked about nation-state

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,119
reactions to those threats we've looked

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,339
at a number of research projects that

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,130
are going on another big component of

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,920
what we do here it's serious and what we

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,000
view is critical to working in the

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,530
information realm is the area of privacy

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,579
one of the reasons for good security is

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,840
to have good privacy and the to really

28
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,169
go together they're often referred to

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,070
together but they're not the same

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,619
policies are different than some of the

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,820
characteristics we measure or different

32
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,280
so we wanted to have someone here who

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,490
could represent some of the interesting

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,049
issues related to privacy one of the

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,250
best people to do that is somebody who's

36
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,280
been working in the field for a while

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,960
and is very well known starting off as a

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
chief private well not starting off but

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,979
notable as chief privacy officer at Sun

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,298
Microsystems which is where I first

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,070
encountered her and then moving on

42
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,289
through a number of different things

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,689
ending up at the mcafee Intel McAfee

44
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:10,130
being acquired by Intel as a chief

45
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,049
privacy officer and vice president

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,450
michelle has been working in the area

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,640
for quite some time is very notable for

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,140
a number of the things she's done and in

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,679
the interest of her privacy I'm not

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,858
going to say

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,510
more about those I will instead let her

52
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,629
fill you in on what she would like to

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,060
say but more importantly is for her to

54
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,980
present her or talk this afternoon so

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,689
please join me in welcoming Michelle

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,719
gender identity thank you so much and

57
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,638
and thank you too to staff into Josh

58
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,340
it's been I think a three or four year

59
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,340
odyssey to get to Indiana so I am so

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,349
pleased to finally be here and I'm going

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,909
to shamelessly embarrass my nephew

62
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,619
traver Clifford who's a freshman here at

63
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,980
Purdue studying computer science so he

64
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,980
will join our our ranks soon soon soon

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,530
we can't wait not soon enough so I want

66
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,268
to talk a little bit why do we care

67
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,579
about privacy it and really more

68
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,109
importantly what should we do about it

69
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,109
and then I'm going to end with what I've

70
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:13,319
been doing lately this year with a small

71
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:16,260
kind of PSA for diversity just for a

72
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,700
moment because I think it's very topical

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,280
a lot of a lot of what we're going to

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,339
talk about today comes from a different

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,409
perspective of the threat landscape and

76
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,060
the people Lansky escape and the data

77
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:33,298
centricity landscape so I want to start

78
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,489
with really going to talk about a book

79
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,650
that you can get for free I never

80
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,569
promised to be a great businesswoman you

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,859
can buy the paper but you can download

82
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:47,310
for free from google play on your kindle

83
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:50,099
on your nook or at a press com a book i

84
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,379
co-authored with two very special people

85
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,048
in my life one is my business partner of

86
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,239
the last 15 years over various array of

87
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,280
companies who came out of the digital

88
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,919
publishing world his name is Jonathan

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,949
Fox when I first encountered Jonathan

90
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,409
who is now my chief of staff at Intel

91
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:11,970
security he was the editor in chief of

92
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:13,918
sun calm and responsible for different

93
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,289
constituencies receiving all sorts of

94
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,849
content both on the heavy heavy

95
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,668
technical side some of our Java

96
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,349
communities and listservs and then all

97
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,849
of the other kind of outreach and public

98
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:28,469
works kinds of world so he very much is

99
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,990
operation on the value side of the chain

100
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,700
and then the other person is my father

101
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,760
so Tom Finneran

102
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,120
grandpa has been in the computer science

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,430
realm since before we called it that he

104
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
studied at The Ohio State University go

105
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,420
buckeyes sorry for do and when to the

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,280
Navy soon thereafter now the interesting

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,930
thing so there's a mix of generations

108
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,979
with students and some of us who are a

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,720
little slightly more mature back in the

110
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,750
punch card days who remembers the punch

111
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,460
cards do you know what happens when

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,710
you're five and you knock over a bunch

113
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,510
of punch cards yeah yeah you know what

114
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:14,070
in the 70s corporal punishment was a

115
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,380
thing so I grew up on a raised data

116
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,050
floor back in my broken childhood with

117
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,719
my dad the other element of my

118
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,920
upbringing was my both of my parents are

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,630
patent attorneys and so from a very

120
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,330
small one and I actually went and

121
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,950
followed I was actually a psychology a

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,690
Bachelor of Science with that

123
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,360
psychopharmacology was kind of my bent

124
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,750
and self-efficacy was my senior thesis

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,750
at Ohio State as well and then I went on

126
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,580
to law school and I'll tell you two

127
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,880
stories the first is you know why

128
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,640
technology why human factors why human

129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,550
antec together back in the early 80s

130
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,530
when i started at Ohio State there was a

131
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,450
research flyer for a research assistant

132
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,960
in robotics and I thought well that

133
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,550
sounds fun who doesn't love robot so I

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,680
signed up and it was through the special

135
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,230
education department and what we were

136
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,060
doing is we took a Rico industrialized

137
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,340
machine so have you ever seen one of

138
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,590
those like car arm screws in car

139
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,810
repetitively well they have these nice

140
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,409
joints and things so we took our apple

141
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,860
2e plus probably programming and basic

142
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:25,110
or Pascal and we adapted the the paddle

143
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,300
input to five different paddles which

144
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,340
were kind of identified joint tell it

145
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,220
what to do and then go so it was quite a

146
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,679
cumbersome thing to move the thing

147
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,720
around so when I first showed up at the

148
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,550
school my job was to track the movements

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
figure out how the kids learned science

150
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,990
and teach them science and judge their

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,289
reaction interfacing with robotic

152
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,680
technology and the

153
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,330
that was bespoke for the purpose so day

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,740
one I pulled up at the school is an

155
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,599
elementary school with a special ed

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,339
program and I said hey I'm from The Ohio

157
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,219
State University I'm all of 18 years old

158
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,710
I'm quite cool tell me where the

159
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,808
research is for the special education

160
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,479
and this woman kind of looked him in she

161
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:05,889
goes oh the vegetables yeah the

162
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,979
vegetables are in the back of the school

163
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:12,610
they're depressing and I thought okay

164
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:17,680
thing number one we call students

165
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,389
vegetables red flag on the play so I go

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,180
in and I teach them and the thing that

167
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,639
happens then is it now is particularly

168
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,529
when you have bespoke code there are

169
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,020
bugs inevitably and in our code there

170
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:31,808
was as well and so there are 17 discrete

171
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,990
strokes that when you hit those in that

172
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:37,899
precise order it would cause the machine

173
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,479
to reset and so what the kids would do

174
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:43,149
inevitably and every one of them learn

175
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
how to do it very quickly they would

176
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:47,080
grab some sort of a beaker of something

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,659
liquid and then if you've ever worked

178
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,669
with a robotic arm of that ilk they

179
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:55,149
don't just like stop they go like this

180
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:59,080
and then they reset back to home so what

181
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:00,849
happens when you're in a lab with

182
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,830
millions of dollars of equipment and

183
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,680
lots at stake and lots of grown-ups they

184
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,568
start everyone starts freaking out

185
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,599
except a child formerly known as

186
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:14,009
vegetable and their teacher an

187
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,300
eighteen-year-old you know dummy like me

188
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,909
who looked in each other's eyes and we

189
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,649
laughed and we had a moment and that was

190
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,899
the light bulb that has directed the

191
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,389
rest of the course of my life it's not

192
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:28,719
the technology that's cool at all as it

193
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:31,779
turns out it's how it allows us to be

194
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:34,479
more human it's how it not just eases a

195
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:37,899
burden but actually shares a moment it's

196
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,209
how it be turned a vegetable into

197
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,188
someone who could communicate with his

198
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,688
or her parents and tell them what they

199
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,949
wanted for lunch instead of letting it

200
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,050
just dribble down the side of their

201
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,089
faces and someone who started to believe

202
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,430
that they could and so as I got further

203
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,689
into my studies with these kids and more

204
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,670
we also found that their self-efficacy

205
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:59,560
levels with their mind body spirit right

206
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,810
could actually raise their t cell

207
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,150
production lower their cortisol

208
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,770
production so their health was better

209
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,290
their welfare was better their psyche

210
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,390
was better and our technology got better

211
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,469
so that's kind of the the first step of

212
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:17,350
it the second is when I went back to law

213
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,180
school I found out very quickly from one

214
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,890
of these wonderful phd's I actually went

215
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,050
in and interviewed to get my PhD in

216
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,260
psychology thinking I'm pretty hot stuff

217
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,670
as an undergrad why not get a PhD and I

218
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,140
sat down I told him how it's going to

219
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,189
change the world of technology and how

220
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,990
it's really great it's going to really

221
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,790
you know help us to communicate and do

222
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,910
all these great things and and he said

223
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,219
young lady come over here let me show

224
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,110
you my calendar here's the meeting with

225
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,760
the Dean where I fight for money here's

226
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,380
the meeting where I do organize a

227
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,970
meeting here's a meeting when I take in

228
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,550
students and seeing staff naughty and

229
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,610
going the day-to-day job of a researcher

230
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,160
and an academic is not the same job as I

231
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,170
was describing how do I go out and just

232
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,510
go crazy telling the world that these

233
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,130
users are not vegetables but these users

234
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,830
can actually tell us how to design

235
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,560
systems better than we can that these

236
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,390
inventors who seem so crazy aren't so

237
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,989
crazy after all they can create new

238
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,610
novel and non-obvious things so he said

239
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,140
go often be an advocate for a couple

240
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,780
years and if you still want to come back

241
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,250
kiddo you're in and it's been about 30

242
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,920
years so I think he's still waiting

243
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,130
somewhere but he was right I went to law

244
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,290
school and it was my second time there

245
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,060
because my mom my dad went through on

246
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,280
the GI Bill and I eat while he was being

247
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,770
an engineer for Standard Oil and then my

248
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,180
mom went through when I went to

249
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,470
kindergarten so I went to kindergarten

250
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,910
and then she'd pick me up and we'd go to

251
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,280
law school together so it took me two

252
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,100
rounds to get through school now the

253
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,209
first and then I'll stop telling stories

254
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,350
until I could tell potty training

255
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,510
stories about Traver and really

256
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,730
embarrassing if there's any young coeds

257
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,420
in the back he's really a good guy so

258
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,100
it's just his his aunt is a little so I

259
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,110
was sitting there in class in law school

260
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,760
and not knowing that I wanted to be a

261
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,590
patent litigator at the time but still

262
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,680
with this love of Technology and it's

263
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,480
love people and my professor said you

264
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,479
know there's a case and Socratic method

265
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,190
stand up and be humiliated come come

266
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,930
nigh we'll pay you more later but we'll

267
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,040
come and be humiliated

268
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,380
aided in law school it's kind of how it

269
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,089
goes and he said you know there's a

270
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,490
traffic light and the only people that

271
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,770
could could access it or the Public

272
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,210
Works people and both sides of the light

273
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,000
were green at the same time causing

274
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,170
accident what is that called and this is

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,480
like our first week in school and we're

276
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,020
all SAT there terrified and I still have

277
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,940
but I went res ipsa loquitur and he

278
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,410
looked at me like oh my gosh because

279
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,300
that's actually the right answer it's a

280
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,189
Latin phrase saying the thing it speaks

281
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:43,199
for itself and the reason I do that is I

282
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,610
have there's three girls and one boy my

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,670
family we're all you know Irish

284
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,970
quintuplets years less than a year apart

285
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,959
most of us and whenever we'd go out and

286
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,149
play in the yard my mom would be

287
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,619
studying for her law school exams and I

288
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,990
always remember we had this one little

289
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,360
commode right near the playground and

290
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,970
we'd come inside and she'd come out and

291
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,380
she'd say Thomas Robert Finneran jr. put

292
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,149
that toilet seat down and he'd always

293
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,770
stand there go well how'd you know me

294
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:13,020
and she'd stand on our porch and say

295
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:14,760
raise it so I but are so it doesn't have

296
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,310
a lot to do with privacy engineering but

297
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:23,520
such a good story so the combination of

298
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,439
these things of what happens when you

299
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,209
are the ultimate system holder what

300
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,470
happens if you have a perspective that

301
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,109
people are actually people not

302
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,660
vegetables what happens when law and

303
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,360
policy and value and technology come

304
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,990
together well what we hope happens is a

305
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,060
privacy engineering manifesto so I want

306
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,400
to tell you the last of hopefully my

307
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:48,270
longer winded stories but a story of

308
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,089
exploration of once upon a time when

309
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,209
there was a time when it was

310
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,730
economically viable to get to a new land

311
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:59,160
and discover new lands and to bring in

312
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,310
more Commerce and spices were more

313
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,520
valuable than gold and in that time the

314
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,910
thing holding us back was technology and

315
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,390
will because everyone knew that the

316
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,310
world is flat everyone the church said

317
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,380
it the rich people said it everyone in

318
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,910
control said the world is flat there are

319
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,680
dragons at the end of the world and if

320
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,350
we travel over there everything will go

321
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,699
south and we'll everything will end

322
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,709
except that there were observers

323
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:27,748
who actually knew how to sail and they

324
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:30,059
looked out at a sky that looked like a

325
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:32,009
bowl and when they walked toward the

326
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,689
horizon it seemed to just have a brief

327
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,819
kiss and then you wandered closer and it

328
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,769
kept going so they took everything that

329
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:39,959
they knew and they take a diverse group

330
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,759
of people and they got some money and

331
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,569
they use the current technology and

332
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,970
guess what happened we discovered that

333
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:49,889
there's endless opportunities so the

334
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,209
beginning the end of that myth of the

335
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,949
dragon began a new one so everyone has

336
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,449
told me for the entirety of my career

337
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:59,998
since I switched from patent litigation

338
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:02,549
into data protection and privacy and

339
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:04,649
security the privacy is dead how many of

340
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,858
you believe it come on you can omit it

341
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:10,259
privacy is dead so much technology

342
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:11,759
everyone can see it everyone says

343
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,379
privacy you know Scott McNealy my old

344
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,379
boss said privacy is dead and they

345
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,609
topped off with a hearty get over it

346
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:20,609
which is great except I worked for him

347
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:21,989
and I was doing privacy not so much it's

348
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,809
still probably the most quoted quote

349
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:27,449
Larry Ellison the boss who I got when he

350
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:30,149
bought my company also there's no

351
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,069
privacy get over it I've heard this a

352
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:35,459
million times in a different in a bunch

353
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:37,979
of different shades except I'm an

354
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,508
observer of people and projects and

355
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,639
things and there's not a single one of

356
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,829
y'all despite the fact that we all have

357
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,649
Amazon that is dressed identically today

358
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,628
we crave individuality we seek

359
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,600
individuality but at the same time

360
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:54,359
orthogonal II we're kind of boring we

361
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,069
eat we sleep we procreate we die so

362
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:59,189
there are patterns that are similar but

363
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:01,498
there's individuality that says what is

364
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:04,079
this privacy complex thing and can we

365
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:06,869
ever hope to actually have standards and

366
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,108
systems that are somewhat predictable

367
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,600
that can be used to innovate can we get

368
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:15,179
on our little ship and sail to a

369
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,100
different horizon and think about

370
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,869
privacy differently but there certainly

371
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,669
are dragons there are stormy seas ahead

372
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,529
there are all these revelations from

373
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,689
traders I mean I guess that's a

374
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,879
perspective I shouldn't say out loud I

375
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:29,849
mean gentleman who may or may not want

376
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,319
to be reality stars who are enjoying

377
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,759
their borscht with Putin right now and

378
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,969
complaining about surveillance in Russia

379
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,350
I'm sure just to have a little

380
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,540
perspective

381
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,370
my opinions are all my own by the way

382
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,870
none of mine should be impugned to intel

383
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,790
corporation or any of its boards of

384
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,400
directors or even customers they are my

385
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,709
own but but whether or not you like Ed

386
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,750
Snowden and what he did I think it's

387
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,210
more of a failure of our press than it

388
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,790
is that individual person we've had

389
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,680
people wanting to have a dialogue of

390
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,290
where is the virtual cop on the beat and

391
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,359
what would we have him do what is the

392
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,579
corridor that is public what is the

393
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,950
corridor that is private these are the

394
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,500
questions that are very thorny very

395
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,630
difficult very multicultural and they're

396
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,850
much more interesting to me than a pole

397
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,640
dancing girl in Hawaii in love with a

398
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,530
guy who steals laptops that's an easy

399
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,000
conversation to have and we can have

400
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,130
opinions on both sides of that whether

401
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,550
he's a hero or whether he's a traitor

402
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,430
but the harder conversation is what do

403
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,280
we want our society to look like what

404
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,160
are the inherent risks in not taking

405
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,160
action on threats that we can detect

406
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,870
what are the trade-offs if we do so

407
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,310
those are some of the student the stormy

408
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,770
seas and some of these are repetitions

409
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,689
of the past I think we're calling it big

410
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,939
data now you know the availability of

411
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,010
Hadoop and parallel processing to help

412
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,020
us make decisions I won't say better

413
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,189
ones but hopefully correlated ones at

414
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,829
least next year we'll call it ultra data

415
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,140
or data by zhing or something but we

416
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,720
used to just call that statistics right

417
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,250
back in the day ye olde day if you had a

418
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,770
sample size large enough for it to be

419
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,950
something we called it statistics

420
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,260
whether or not we like the hype whether

421
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,690
or not we believe that clouds can be

422
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,579
managed well on or off Prem these are

423
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,550
the stormy seas that impact our ability

424
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,339
to have I think a practical conversation

425
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,609
about privacy and this is the result we

426
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,250
leave the users on the shore how often

427
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:31,979
do we design systems and just refer to

428
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,020
people as users I will assert to you

429
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:38,430
that it is the modern-day version of

430
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:42,389
vegetable I'm not a vegetable I'm person

431
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:45,480
who has some decisions to make and I've

432
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,430
been disenfranchised to be dumb so it's

433
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,590
not just about make it easy it's not

434
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,550
just take choice away it's not like oh

435
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,060
we can't pasa

436
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,020
we educate these users it's how do we

437
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,120
actually think differently about

438
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,190
designing systems and the integrity of

439
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,550
system so that we can actually have some

440
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,070
participatory specifications and

441
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,740
requirements and so this is my

442
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,780
suggestion to you is that we

443
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,700
functionalize the definition the core

444
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,830
definition of what is privacy for the

445
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,450
purpose of industrialized information

446
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,570
and by industrialized please think

447
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,060
broadly NGO you know educational

448
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,740
government etc but other than that

449
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,600
colloquial conversation about you know

450
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,670
what kind of skirts your child should

451
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,199
wear and how long should they be when

452
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,210
you're building systems for privacy I

453
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,640
will assert to you and this is a much

454
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,110
longer actually teaching a semester-long

455
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,270
class based on this so I'll give you

456
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,850
light my back of envelope definition

457
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,730
which is we believe that privacy can be

458
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,260
considered to be the authorized

459
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,540
processing of personally identifiable

460
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,090
information according to Fair

461
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,250
Information principles and each one of

462
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,070
these unpacks a little bit and I don't

463
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,230
have long enough to really unpack it but

464
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,960
think about the authorization the entire

465
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,390
explosion of identity management tools

466
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,880
and technologies the texture that you

467
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,920
can have with a role-based ecosystem the

468
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,990
decision when you federated information

469
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,140
maybe from cloud to cloud may be

470
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,490
physically may be virtually and

471
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,700
permission how do we deal with the

472
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,410
terribleness of passwords how do we deal

473
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,210
with if we decide to move on to a

474
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,850
biometric all of those kinds of

475
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,650
decisions fall under I think the who is

476
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,949
allowed to do what with where and whom

477
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:28,470
under authorization processing I think

478
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,930
we focus very closely on either

479
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,820
collection or result and we kind of

480
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,850
forget about everything in between an

481
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,760
end of life so we get very upset when

482
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:41,070
we're forced to fill out another form we

483
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,250
get very upset when somebody already has

484
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,500
a data set relating to us but we kind of

485
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,900
don't build our systems thinking what if

486
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,120
you actually followed a system from

487
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,210
cradle to grave and how it might

488
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,550
interact with different systems as you

489
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,250
put these kind of Lego blocks these

490
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,080
tangible computing objects of systems

491
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,450
that are capable of processing personal

492
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,320
data and then personally identifiable

493
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,779
information

494
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,210
definition legally and socially is

495
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,340
expanding I think when you said IP

496
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,919
address was a personal piece of personal

497
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,480
information even three years ago the

498
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,700
technical community just kind of rolled

499
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,500
their eyes ii and said you're crazy most

500
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,840
of these IP addresses really are only

501
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,409
the address to an apartment building and

502
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,879
not to a person's room but more and more

503
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,490
we're seeing legislation from around the

504
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,620
world saying de facto every IP address

505
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,409
equals personal information we're going

506
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,508
to see a lot more of this because of the

507
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:38,220
Internet of Things data mesh networks

508
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:41,129
that's not being built with privacy

509
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,490
engineering because surveillance has not

510
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:47,668
had that conversation in art in law in

511
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,980
the public with customer input that we

512
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,480
need to have but that definition of

513
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,289
personally identifiable information is

514
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,490
expanding far beyond the kind of classic

515
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:59,730
definition which is a piece of

516
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,009
information that which on its own or in

517
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,440
combination with others identifies a

518
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,960
human person that's been the definition

519
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,389
for at least 20 years it's a good one

520
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,470
but it's getting mushy ER with the

521
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:14,850
ability of what we're calling big data

522
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,500
and then fair information principles you

523
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,629
can put whatever accent on this you want

524
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,220
you can call Oh a CD principles you can

525
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:23,820
look at the new tie law that was just

526
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,889
put out there in draft today most of the

527
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,320
fair processing principles are things

528
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:30,658
we've been talking about since the 1960s

529
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,178
either in relationship to government

530
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,940
data health data financial data or

531
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:38,370
internationally in a very broadcast so

532
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,440
if we look at these and we say this is

533
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,379
actually if you think about it can be

534
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,840
converted into requirements and

535
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:47,969
specifications and those requirements

536
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,539
and specifications can be communicated

537
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,370
to developers to managers to get a

538
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,158
governance professionals to lawyers to

539
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:59,189
judges to citizens we suddenly create

540
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,840
instead of a yes/no determination on

541
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,570
something as compliments you know as

542
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,399
complicated as fundamental as the whole

543
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,408
data set that describes you it

544
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,969
throughout your lifetime suddenly we've

545
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,730
broken it down into something that we

546
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:17,460
can innovate on hallelujah that's what

547
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,730
we do when you do that my suggestion to

548
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,500
you

549
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,200
oh is that you've now put that person in

550
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,880
the center of the mix when you go

551
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,100
through this process with younger people

552
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,110
especially people who have grown up in

553
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,540
the digital age well you find very

554
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,510
quickly is kids do care about their

555
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,399
privacy that's how many people do not

556
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,810
believe that is true oh they put

557
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,410
everything on facebook what do they know

558
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,300
it's today I tell you well if you ask I

559
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,130
my typical thing that I start off with

560
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,120
me in high school junior high is okay

561
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:50,160
who pooped today and they look at you

562
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,060
like All Right see we have one hand up

563
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:58,410
okay all y'all gonna die cuz there's a

564
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,700
it's a system garbage in garbage out so

565
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,150
you walk into a high school and they are

566
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,320
more to fight that you even know and

567
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,760
then it's like oh my god who's the

568
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,139
creepy mom talking about that and then I

569
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,870
like point to that guy and I'll be like

570
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,290
hey you jock I know you get a crush on

571
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,699
her and they'll be like oh my gosh so I

572
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,340
was like that reaction that you're

573
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,320
feeling young ladies and gentlemen is

574
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:23,610
how I feel when I see you with a red

575
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,230
Dixie cup traver Clifford which he never

576
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,719
does there's only juice in there when he

577
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:30,960
partnered with my nephew that's how I

578
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,600
feel when my mortgage score is disclosed

579
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,050
publicly or my my real estate and my

580
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,669
home is actually published online

581
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,879
publicly without any sort of protection

582
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,830
so do they care about what your credit

583
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,660
card data is no do they care about

584
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,730
saying really stupid stuff do they have

585
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,170
the judgment that you have after half a

586
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,840
century of walking on the planet

587
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,970
probably not does that mean that they

588
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,100
are not setting requirements and jumping

589
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,230
liquidly from platform to platform and

590
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,679
choosing to curate different personas

591
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:04,500
that they choose I will pause it to you

592
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,700
that if every citizen guarded their data

593
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,970
as closely and creatively as a 13 year

594
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,770
old girl guards to the name of her crush

595
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:18,330
we would need to be here so think about

596
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,830
who are the people we're not asking

597
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,480
about when we asked about system

598
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,399
requirements and specifications and

599
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,860
let's start getting their input really

600
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,260
early in this process to understand what

601
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,850
systems are supposed to be doing not

602
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,049
just what our systems supposed to be

603
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,769
getting away with

604
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,960
that's a compliance discussion so a

605
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,929
privacy engineer we really defining is a

606
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,059
very broad brush of community I am NOT a

607
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,830
technologist by birth I kind of well I

608
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:48,239
sort of am by birth I guess but not by

609
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,799
training but my input is just as valid

610
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:51,299
with the other specification

611
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,009
requirements holders I'm the I'm the

612
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,629
governor of the system I'm the one who's

613
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,759
talking to the guys in Washington and

614
00:24:54,629 --> 00:25:00,289
Beijing and and around the world in

615
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,850
Strasbourg so multidisciplinary

616
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:05,039
creativity expression to innovate and

617
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,320
communicate is what is needed to really

618
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,480
get on the bandwagon of coming up with a

619
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,239
system that is data in person centric

620
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,739
and drawing from all sorts of people so

621
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,989
this is back to my kind of columbus

622
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:17,639
illusion of you couldn't have you

623
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:20,639
couldn't have sailed into unknown waters

624
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:22,139
without a sextant without someone to

625
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,850
make sure you have the right provisions

626
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:25,559
on your ship to someone who is aware of

627
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,899
situational intelligence what does it

628
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,480
look like when the boat is going wrong

629
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:33,779
so thinking about your finance your use

630
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,749
your experience art design surely we can

631
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:38,940
stop doing click drop down click surely

632
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:43,580
like doesn't anyone have a girlfriend in

633
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,960
art school come on now we can do better

634
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,519
and I'm asking everybody to kind of lay

635
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,109
their best things on the table so dual

636
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,940
book accounting for example from the

637
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:53,759
finance side of the world pretty good

638
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,830
stuff we didn't use it maybe less than a

639
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,440
hundred years ago and now our entire

640
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:02,489
world economy depends a profit and loss

641
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,080
on assets and liabilities we need to

642
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:06,690
bring those things to the table again

643
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,428
and say these are the tools that we can

644
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,940
use from each of these disciplines to

645
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:15,269
say what is it that we need to educate

646
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,220
our boards on when you know that most

647
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:21,330
people on boards today and public

648
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,039
companies are CEOs salesman that's what

649
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,639
a CEO is and does if they're doing their

650
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,950
job and finance people how are they ever

651
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:31,019
going to grapple with data how are they

652
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,100
ever going to grapple with what is good

653
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:37,200
and quality in risk for data and I don't

654
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,949
necessarily mean insurance risk I mean

655
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,830
why isn't Sony kicking Microsoft's butt

656
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,700
out the window because they've spent a

657
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,270
lot of time

658
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,430
cleaning up after sony number one breach

659
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:52,320
when their systems were actually making

660
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,180
really good headway and since that time

661
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,659
they've spent hundreds of millions of

662
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,880
dollars cleaning up a hacked breach so

663
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,710
the opportunity cost isn't the one that

664
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,710
gets talked about the amount of lawyers

665
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,330
the amount of financial damage etc

666
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,420
that's the stuff that gets talked about

667
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,699
after these breaches but the opportunity

668
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,430
to sail to a different Shore to actually

669
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,150
go forward is what is lost every time

670
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:19,350
you hear one of these massive breaches

671
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,180
so I'm running a little short on time so

672
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,689
I'll go very quickly little short on

673
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,600
time one that sometimes the most complex

674
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,820
problems can be solved by really elegant

675
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,320
technology and I'll just kind of put up

676
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,260
for you if you haven't read Dava so

677
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,060
bells longitude read longitude one of

678
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,460
the hardest problems to international

679
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:41,570
commerce wasn't just the policy in the

680
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,010
law they had people pirates Packers

681
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:48,899
jumping on two ships and taking off

682
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:50,190
cargo or taking ships or the ship itself

683
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,530
didn't know where to go so it would run

684
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,110
out of provisions before I got to shore

685
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,670
the problem of longitude was the problem

686
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,780
of international opportunity and

687
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:02,640
commerce and it was solved by someone

688
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:06,810
who decided that a pendulum pendulum

689
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,090
clock at sea kind of sucked doesn't

690
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:12,659
really work and the Stars can't be

691
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,159
predictively scheduled for viewing so

692
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,950
something as simple as a pocket watch

693
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,780
actually enabled an entire world economy

694
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,880
I think that's where we're at with

695
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,680
privacy and security will make it a

696
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,640
little more elegant a little more simple

697
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,410
but it's going to get a little more

698
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,030
complicated first because we've got to

699
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,450
lay the groundwork before we just start

700
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,700
building and gluing things together so

701
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,770
these are our sextons tools these are

702
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,980
our dual book accountings is classic

703
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,750
engineering tools so this is where in

704
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,550
the in the privacy engineers manifesto

705
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,830
and please do take a look at I'd love to

706
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,290
have any sort of criticism it was

707
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,110
written you know by a psych major and a

708
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,800
retired systems engineer and a publisher

709
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:54,540
so please tell me I'm wrong I beg you

710
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,480
make something simpler this is probably

711
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,470
the pendulum clock but it's the it's the

712
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,000
only thing I've had

713
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,549
to build my systems and build my

714
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,679
products for you but basically starting

715
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:07,350
with these flowcharts and using system

716
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,140
development tools and techniques going

717
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:12,149
through metadata models I cannot tell

718
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,669
you how many groups i have walked into

719
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,020
over the years and said where's your

720
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,360
data they want to know how to build a

721
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,250
privacy system or a governance system or

722
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,990
information strategy system and i say

723
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,720
where's your data and they show me a

724
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,179
systems diagram I said don't show me a

725
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,610
tin can tell me what's in the in it and

726
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:31,860
they say oh this is it and so I you know

727
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,899
I have gone as far as going into my

728
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,459
pantry and taking the labels off the

729
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,110
cans because they look like the diagrams

730
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,480
that they send you and I'm like we're

731
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,270
going to cook today and I get out a bowl

732
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,090
and I just start with my can opener

733
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:48,210
little peas little chilly little pie

734
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:52,350
sauce and you stir it all up that's what

735
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:55,710
you just gave me crap don't get me grab

736
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,689
I need to know what's in there because

737
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,700
that's where the law comes from the law

738
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,590
comes from what is the right being

739
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,200
impinged what is the opportunity that

740
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,168
we're going after if you want big data

741
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,130
it shouldn't be big data in and gospel

742
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:13,950
out it should be garbage in garbage out

743
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,620
know where your data is and if you start

744
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:19,169
to look at systems from a data and

745
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,030
person perspective then suddenly you

746
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:22,799
create this library and I've done this

747
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,740
for Intel security for all of our

748
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,639
products it's amazing to me because

749
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,070
people are paid to work on features when

750
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,740
you look at that feature in the wild and

751
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,020
I'm talking to it when things go wrong

752
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,549
I'm not the guy who's like 18 months

753
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,200
later we tape out and we send it out the

754
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,389
door and then I'm on to the next thing

755
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,210
I'm the guy who has to live with the

756
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,370
soup whatever is in that bowl so what I

757
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,960
do is I have a system of record for data

758
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,389
and then when people want to attach

759
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,309
things to my system I do an API call

760
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:56,070
because the engineer says oh I only need

761
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,750
address oh and it's anonymous I love

762
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,070
that that's my favorite so you don't

763
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,130
know what the data is but you can tell

764
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,928
me that it's anonymous for shower okay

765
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,260
I'm a cynical girl I don't believe y'all

766
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:09,240
so what I do is I do an API call and say

767
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,789
what is the made it metadata model how

768
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,419
do we prove that this is the information

769
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:14,429
going from

770
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,080
30 on and it actually turns out doesn't

771
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,999
have to slow down your system thinking

772
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,119
whether you're waterfall or you're agile

773
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:24,989
what I posit to you is that when you put

774
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:27,779
the the series of privacy controls down

775
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:29,609
one side those requirements you know

776
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,499
proportionality is it doing what it says

777
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:33,210
it is in the right amounts how do you

778
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:35,519
query the data where do you keep the

779
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,159
data how long does the data live these

780
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,710
are zero and one questions that comprise

781
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,659
fair practices and principles when you

782
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,470
put them down on a system activity

783
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:49,070
diagram on a business activity diagram

784
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:51,659
suddenly you know what a bug looks like

785
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,580
hallelujah we've never tracked for

786
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,039
privacy bugs we've never done privacy

787
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,600
pen testing because we haven't measured

788
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,879
from the metadata and what it's supposed

789
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,519
to be doing once you build it this way

790
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:04,949
it's a lot easier to then go back and do

791
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,080
automated calls automated auditing and

792
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,850
system controls on top of that because

793
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,009
guess what technology particularly in

794
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,738
the privacy space is not a silver bullet

795
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:16,139
at all you're still really balancing

796
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:18,960
between things like context what to my

797
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:20,488
user expect to happen when it happened

798
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,929
before it happened now I'll give you an

799
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,570
example of this when I first came to

800
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:27,509
mcafee I was really surprised at how

801
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:30,570
often my system was calling up the

802
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:31,679
system to check for antivirus I really

803
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,509
thought it was like when you patched

804
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
which shows you my technical ignorance I

805
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:36,960
think a lot of consumers felt the same

806
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,249
thing that the system was just kind of

807
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,580
sitting there is a logo and didn't

808
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:43,830
activate until I activated it not true

809
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,019
so to say that it took me 16 pages of

810
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:49,678
tight legalese language and you can find

811
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:51,239
that at McAfee dot-com / priority but if

812
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,759
you don't feel like reading 16 pages of

813
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:55,499
single spaced legal text you can also

814
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,499
look at my graphic novel that i did with

815
00:32:55,499 --> 00:33:00,960
chubby little ninjas because they act

816
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:02,220
out the show and they were fun and they

817
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,009
were cute and my boss thought it was

818
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,539
crazy but then i started benchmarking

819
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,659
them and testing them and showing them

820
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,908
to people whose language wasn't first

821
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,169
first used English and they looked at

822
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,609
the ninjas and they saw what the ninjas

823
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:17,609
were doing as they acted out what our

824
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:19,559
products do not to a terribly granular

825
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,960
level but at least enough of a basis so

826
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:24,480
people could understand what we're about

827
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,429
suddenly I had context and context

828
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,360
lowers my risk from a

829
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:32,190
a angle and it and it raises my profile

830
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,830
as a company that has brand that

831
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,139
actually has person centricity so

832
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:39,869
thinking things through from this level

833
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:42,269
allows me as your corporate actor to

834
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:43,860
interact with you faster I close deals

835
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:45,629
quicker people want to know how we're

836
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,389
processing the data and I actually know

837
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:50,340
we're building tools that we know the

838
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:53,119
deficits as well as we know the features

839
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,830
and the beauty of all of this stuff is

840
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,360
everybody who takes computer science

841
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,939
should know how to do this this is not

842
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,860
proprietary stuff this is dual book

843
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:07,409
accounting and we need to do it for data

844
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,719
and we need to do it desperately now so

845
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:11,250
at the end of the day I want you to

846
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,290
think about your data I'll tell you one

847
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,739
more story yeah I got time for one more

848
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:19,139
story this is what am I I call it the

849
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:22,500
rat baby and I'm sorry for my blue

850
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:24,270
language but once upon time there was

851
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,250
somebody in the Midwest who bought a

852
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,359
little china doll and thought oh this is

853
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,790
so beautiful I won't put in my

854
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,379
collection lil chine it all goes in the

855
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,730
collection and another one and then

856
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:37,049
another and suddenly we have a show

857
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,780
called hoarders suddenly that baby is

858
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:42,629
like getting dug out on reality TV and

859
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,490
it's covered in rat that's what

860
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,879
most of our data centers look like a rat

861
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:50,250
 baby I know you loved it when you

862
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,469
collected it do you know what you're

863
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,929
doing with it is it bringing you value

864
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,848
in any way no why we're not having that

865
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,559
conversation the boardroom because we

866
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:01,049
think that processing is cheap and

867
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,740
storage is free and I'm telling you that

868
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:06,839
ratchet babies expensive that mold grows

869
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,078
across your data center and your big

870
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:13,380
data turns into big garbage so curating

871
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,760
data understanding datas value and what

872
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,890
should be put forth and what should be

873
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,109
in storage for later is really what all

874
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:21,450
fine art museums do it's what all

875
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,990
performance artists do its what these

876
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:28,140
other creative people call communication

877
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:31,649
it also lowers your risk exponentially

878
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,740
it makes your IT people's jobs easier it

879
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:37,920
makes your marketing more relevant when

880
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,810
you curate an asset this is what my dad

881
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,170
calls a flat forehead moment

882
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,730
oh yeah when I invest my portfolio and I

883
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,950
think about it it makes me more money

884
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,740
when I invest in the information economy

885
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:52,350
it makes more money this is where we

886
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,500
need to get there are no dragons the

887
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:59,610
world is not flat we can use engineering

888
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,380
techniques that we already know so aside

889
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,470
from the fabulous fashion and I'm really

890
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,020
sad that it's gone this is one of my

891
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:10,049
great heroes and hopefully one of yours

892
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,509
the wonderful rear-admiral grace Murray

893
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,700
hopper and I love this statement dan

894
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,780
gear has it on page 42 of his book I

895
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,100
always thought that was very profound

896
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,530
it's like the answer to life the

897
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,470
universe and everything turns out it's

898
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,760
grace hoppers quote who knit but someday

899
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,370
on the corporate balance sheet there

900
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,670
will be an entry which reads information

901
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,799
for most cases the information is more

902
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,070
valuable than the hardware and i'll add

903
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:40,380
software which process is it she said

904
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:43,080
this in 1965 we're not here yet but we

905
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,670
now we have the technology it's like the

906
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,770
Six Million Dollar Man I could tell when

907
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,020
who's in my my generation as I'm like

908
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,190
you know the bionic woman in the ear you

909
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,130
know what I'm talking about Jaime

910
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:55,200
Sommers was a hot ticket back then but

911
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,240
this is back in the 1960s we're talking

912
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,100
about information as an asset and yet

913
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,779
the other narrative is that storage is

914
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,640
cheap and processing is free and look at

915
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,110
Gordon Moore's economic law was right

916
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,609
but we're not going here yet so I think

917
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,860
this is where we're going I think this

918
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,930
is exciting i think this gets investors

919
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,210
excited and investing i think this gets

920
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,370
people excited in building things that

921
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,170
matter it's not the same as just

922
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,060
building interoperability it's building

923
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,190
interoperability so that you can look in

924
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,100
a small child's eyes and recognize that

925
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:29,060
he's not a vegetable that's cool that's

926
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,900
economically cool that's culturally cool

927
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,060
so this is it you know there's a

928
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,380
10-point manifesto in the Mephisto but

929
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,779
this is my point number one date about

930
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,670
people is valuable people buy things

931
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,220
people think things people feel things

932
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,620
people do things these are all the

933
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,149
language of all of the kind of entities

934
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,650
that we have whether you're an NGO

935
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,150
whether you're a government entity

936
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:52,130
whether you're a corporate entity or

937
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,570
student just starting out your career

938
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,100
at the end of the this all these are my

939
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,610
girls this one just turned nine

940
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,259
yesterday at the end of the journey

941
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:03,710
begins another at the end of the day for

942
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:08,150
me what we've built today is not good

943
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,380
enough for them shame on us shame on us

944
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,210
if we don't have a discussion about

945
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,620
surveillance shame on us if we don't

946
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,720
know how to value information in the

947
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:17,960
information age Sheamus if we don't

948
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,189
recognize GDP is dependent upon people

949
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,350
that know how to innovate in the data

950
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:26,450
economy we can do better a little

951
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,509
looking in the past doesn't hurt to look

952
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:32,180
forward a little humility doesn't hurt

953
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:35,710
to grow and that's really the point of

954
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:38,629
how I really think about building in

955
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,400
things like privacy engineering and

956
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,750
having an open source for the world to

957
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,480
say oh that's bad here's something

958
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:48,500
better so bring it on i'd love something

959
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,320
better oh i don't have my oh no I don't

960
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,420
have my little manifesto oh well well we

961
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,380
won't do that but basically here's the

962
00:38:53,420 --> 00:39:00,140
thing sachcha was wrong if you aren't

963
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,410
part of the whole like women nation

964
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,129
Sasha from Microsoft was asked at Grace

965
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:09,049
Hopper so bless his heart he was there a

966
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,090
woman stood up and said you know it's

967
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,560
really hard for me to ask how to get a

968
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,960
promotion or a raise you know do you

969
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,330
have any tips and he kind of was a

970
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,530
little on the snarky side I think to be

971
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,660
fair he seems like a really nice person

972
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,340
and he's just said oh just do your work

973
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:26,859
really well and will notice that hard

974
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:29,570
work well I've been working really hard

975
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,490
and I've done pretty well for myself but

976
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,150
let me tell you what men and women are

977
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,770
different another flathead moment right

978
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,160
the way we communicate with each other

979
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:43,070
isn't a competition it's a creative

980
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,500
value we actually produce more human

981
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,870
beings when one gets together with the

982
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,970
other one guess what we can also

983
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,830
innovate in the same way when we learn

984
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,680
to respect people from different

985
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:57,020
ethnicities and cultures and genders and

986
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,509
it's not that they're in the room at

987
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,610
some sort of a tally system it's because

988
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,490
we have a different perspective that

989
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,560
will change your mind or challenge you

990
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,720
so that you now know that your

991
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,400
zishan was right and we in the

992
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,069
particularly information security

993
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,400
community are suffering because we're

994
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,650
only using the language of combat and

995
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,320
we're not using the language of why I

996
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,150
think about protecting so you go on a

997
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,520
road trip okay one more story I keep

998
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,800
saying we go on a road trip when my kids

999
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,360
were really small and you know it's five

1000
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,060
hours out of the house I got two small

1001
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,170
kids and you know one inevitably has

1002
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,740
some sort of liquid coming out of

1003
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,940
something so my husband pulls over he

1004
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,890
pulls out the bag when you know I'm

1005
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,660
talking about you have kids and it

1006
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,370
doesn't smell good regardless it's like

1007
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,310
why can't they spurt flowers I don't

1008
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:48,319
know so you this you pull over and he

1009
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,690
pulls out a baggie of raisins and an

1010
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,350
extra outfit and diapers and wipes in it

1011
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,630
and it's like magic magic now mind you

1012
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm so busy planning the diaper bag back

1013
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,770
at the house that we would never have

1014
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,360
left the house if my hunter gatherer

1015
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,300
hadn't said we are going to the park

1016
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,580
because I'm sick of being inside men and

1017
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,900
women different perspectives different

1018
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:14,720
genders different ideas so I really

1019
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,390
exhort every audience to really think

1020
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,500
about have you sat down and really

1021
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,049
listen to someone with another

1022
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,490
perspective when someone has a different

1023
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,830
communication style or they're a little

1024
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,299
more introverted have you really made

1025
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,220
sure that they have a safe place to

1026
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,960
share their ideas in meetings and are

1027
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,060
you really promoting the kind of

1028
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,250
behaviors that would solicit that kind

1029
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,860
of behavior I'm seeing too many young

1030
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,440
women saying cybersecurity is simply not

1031
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,660
for me so that's another reason I've

1032
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,570
been out on this wild road show I'm a

1033
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:48,170
girl I love it here I love that you guys

1034
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,760
are crazy crazy how many like snarky

1035
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,250
black t-shirts with the long ponytail on

1036
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,170
the bowl on top I don't get it but it's

1037
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,020
fascinating to me the Birkenstocks I

1038
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:00,560
don't get it bad fashion I love it I

1039
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,960
love being here I want more women to

1040
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,960
understand that we are welcome here that

1041
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,080
our ideas are needed here that we can

1042
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,370
look at a person and see a person and

1043
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,840
sometimes we can look at numbers and

1044
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,450
just seen numbers there are great

1045
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,950
cryptos out there I love love love but

1046
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,330
they also solve their problems a little

1047
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,790
bit differently so that's that's the end

1048
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,799
of my soapbox but I I kind of made up

1049
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,020
packed with myself that I i I've been

1050
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,580
quiet for too long laughing at all the

1051
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,090
wrong jokes and pretending to be one of

1052
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,830
the guys it's not funny just not funny

1053
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,830
someone licked me this year at a

1054
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,860
conference licked me I wanted to see if

1055
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:41,569
you were as delicious as you looked how

1056
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,820
is that okay how is that okay I have a

1057
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,670
hundred of those stories and I laughed

1058
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:51,140
them off and I have for decades it's not

1059
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:54,050
good enough for my daughters so that's

1060
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,549
my soapbox and that's my my challenges

1061
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,050
let's think about privacy a little bit

1062
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,270
differently let's think about it as an

1063
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,860
additive property to security and not

1064
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,410
something you have to kind of get over

1065
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:06,860
with going forward so I think we have

1066
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:09,290
like two minutes for questions right ten

1067
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,380
minutes a luxury time okay I'm scared

1068
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:14,029
questions or I'm just going to tell

1069
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,890
stories about Trey vers upbringing potty

1070
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:23,290
training please rescue Trevor by going

1071
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:23,290
to the microphone there on the aisle and

1072
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,910
he's actually a contributor in the book

1073
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,440
he architected a runner's app because we

1074
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,410
wanted to prove that this methodology

1075
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,210
will not stop you from garage level

1076
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,069
innovation you can do this with a

1077
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,780
grandpa and an afternoon and probably

1078
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:44,780
pizza and assuming there were still out

1079
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:51,860
is involved at some point we know you

1080
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:58,790
can't program without carbs oh good one

1081
00:43:51,860 --> 00:44:01,340
brave soul so so I wanted to welcome you

1082
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,440
here as a fellow former Sun employee

1083
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,890
it's good to see another fellow we

1084
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,450
survived through the Diaspora exactly I

1085
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,270
wonder if you could talk a little bit

1086
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,549
about I'm security architect I have

1087
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:16,250
security engineers that work for me we

1088
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:19,150
focus on security of systems and

1089
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:22,250
information is there an equivalent

1090
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,230
engineering approach is it part of our

1091
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,420
security engineering focus is it a

1092
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,550
separate organization what do you see is

1093
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,320
the best way to address privacy

1094
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,030
engineering aspects in a

1095
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,320
enterprise yeah so that's a really good

1096
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,480
question actually there's I think that's

1097
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,400
chapter 12 because there's a number of

1098
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,830
different ways of solving this and it's

1099
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,330
a great question because what we end up

1100
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:43,850
doing a lot of times is kind of

1101
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,730
anointing the security architects it's

1102
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:48,529
like oh and privacy it's like oh great

1103
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm doing juggling and tightrope walking

1104
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:56,480
excellent they are related of course and

1105
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:00,560
i also would say and audit so in that

1106
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,980
same vein of the the person with the

1107
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,830
most access and knowledge should have

1108
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,560
something in their HR pay packet related

1109
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:12,080
to this so whether that is your socks

1110
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,330
control guys teaching your security

1111
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,910
architects how to look at data controls

1112
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:20,029
as well as security controls so not just

1113
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:22,670
keeping bad guys out and keeping the

1114
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:25,130
right levels of access in but what is

1115
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,920
the fluid going through the pipe is this

1116
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,780
drinking water or sewage it's a really

1117
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,290
important distinction in most

1118
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,420
architectures so depending on your

1119
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,770
organization and Sons are perfect one of

1120
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,810
this because we kind of did a mess

1121
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,120
mashup so on the privacy council were a

1122
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,490
lot of the guys from the security

1123
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,990
ambassadors program and still like crazy

1124
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,060
Alec Moffitt and stuff and those guys

1125
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:49,189
were all and in Kevin Mandia everyone's

1126
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,509
done quite well they don't give their

1127
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,510
books away for free they actually make

1128
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:56,780
money but what we did is that kind of

1129
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,040
give them the training of the specs so

1130
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,810
that's one way to do it i think the

1131
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,490
other way to do it coming in cold where

1132
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,990
even your security architects or so

1133
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,120
underwater and so overburden because

1134
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,279
there's so much to look at i'll start

1135
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,410
with the auditing team and you got to

1136
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,360
have someone in legal but i'm really

1137
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:16,069
concerned quite honestly how many

1138
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,590
privacy officers are in the gc's office

1139
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:22,040
but not empowered as c-level executives

1140
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,870
and it's not easy to not just fill out

1141
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,090
contracts all day because you can you

1142
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,819
can have a very nice 925 life and say

1143
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:31,700
look how busy i was look how many

1144
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,770
liability clauses i put in and it looks

1145
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,109
like you're doing a really good job so

1146
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:39,950
the CP 0 has kind of been wandering and

1147
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:44,030
during the the 2008 downturn what we saw

1148
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,799
a lot of was the ampersand so if you had

1149
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:48,080
separate sis oh they were stuck under

1150
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,420
the CIO they certainly weren't elevated

1151
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,180
up to that level of a CFO which is

1152
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,040
really where they kind of both belong

1153
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:58,700
but the CEO is already so overwhelmed

1154
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,050
with not going to jail under fraud that

1155
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,549
I think that that's there's a couple

1156
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,370
different ways you can have a dedicated

1157
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,470
organization or you can have a flat

1158
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:09,620
little bit here and there with one

1159
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:11,600
leader but it depends on whether you're

1160
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,270
regulated industry whether you've got an

1161
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,580
ax we're bored what the personality of

1162
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,130
your CP 0 because when i started out

1163
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,900
there were only five of us and now

1164
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,850
there's only 20,000 people that are

1165
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,730
members of our trade union which is I

1166
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:27,680
EPP worldwide that's going to change the

1167
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:30,740
European law will come into effect

1168
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,649
probably early next year it will cover

1169
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,770
unlike the directive which came in 1995

1170
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,750
every member state had to implement this

1171
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,640
will be a regulation so it will

1172
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,290
instantly come into effect and they're

1173
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,180
looking at it the Europeans are looking

1174
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,509
at this as a consumer protection law and

1175
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:50,060
the current draft law says if you have a

1176
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:53,210
severe enough preach it will be five

1177
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:55,700
percent of your worldwide turnover for

1178
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,560
that breach suddenly spines are going to

1179
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,020
get very straight so getting this

1180
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,640
organization in place now is exactly the

1181
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,780
thing and whether that's training so I

1182
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,640
realize I'm a lawyer and I'm not

1183
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,020
answering your question but there's a

1184
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,400
number of different ways to do it you

1185
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,560
can either train up the guys you've got

1186
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,890
now if they have the interest in the and

1187
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,690
the ability or you can get another army

1188
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,150
of kind of privacy counsel people

1189
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,510
loosely coalesced and I think the best

1190
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,530
scenario is to have a really strong

1191
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,230
balanced approach to privacy and

1192
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:27,320
security as equal partners of content

1193
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:32,210
and gear really it's a great question

1194
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:34,310
the hard one I had a question dealing

1195
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,760
with some of the bills that have been

1196
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,410
going around in DC with cybersecurity

1197
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,420
threat information sharing with industry

1198
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,089
could you talk a little bit about i

1199
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,010
guess if McAfee is involved working with

1200
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,170
the White House or from a privacy

1201
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:51,380
perspective I think there's been at

1202
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,910
least 14 amendments to it dealing with

1203
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,800
privacy a lot of people are worried

1204
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,420
about how does government share

1205
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,040
information with industry and vice versa

1206
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,830
and obviously this is

1207
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,970
a big issue dealing with privacy yes I

1208
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,670
just wanted to get your thoughts about

1209
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,080
your engagement with DC well I'm kind of

1210
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,960
under some of the same confidentiality

1211
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,160
shackles we heard before but I think

1212
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,490
there's a lot of vice and not a lot of

1213
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,740
versa is one way of putting it which is

1214
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:19,040
I think there's there's sharing and

1215
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,569
they're sharing and we haven't figured

1216
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,000
out what do process really looks like

1217
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:26,150
and we haven't really figured that out

1218
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,740
for a global community so when we share

1219
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:33,260
information it's actually not hard to

1220
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,040
figure out a good architecture for

1221
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,780
threat intelligence analytics which is

1222
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,820
where I started this whole thing because

1223
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,860
I know what these guys are going to do

1224
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,750
they're going to compare me with

1225
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,460
semantics and trend and not probably not

1226
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,820
kaspersky because God knows what's going

1227
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:52,550
on over there but what they want is the

1228
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:56,240
result and so what I don't get is

1229
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:58,610
whatever IP address or glad or whatever

1230
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,620
they want a square e that happens over

1231
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:02,120
there in secret and I say they meaning a

1232
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,589
whole bunch of different phase right

1233
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,660
this is a global question that we're

1234
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,790
asked this is not a u.s. question and

1235
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,250
anybody who is naive enough to think

1236
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,020
that we are not sharing globally threat

1237
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,520
intelligence data is just cry cry

1238
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:18,890
because we are so I think what can

1239
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,740
happen is you can actually have a safe

1240
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,270
place where a private query can happen

1241
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,370
on the part of someone who is in law

1242
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:28,220
enforcement and what they receive is an

1243
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:30,650
analytic and the analytic if there's

1244
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,129
enough due process from enough sources

1245
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,900
we can give background data and usually

1246
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,450
quite honestly they already have that

1247
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:41,210
data or more data than they already need

1248
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,419
if instead this turns out to be a unique

1249
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:46,040
piece of intelligence that only we have

1250
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,080
then we have other process so that we

1251
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,140
can share more information in a very

1252
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:53,630
intelligent and practiced way I think

1253
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,870
what we need but there's so many things

1254
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:59,570
that we need we need a dialogue a public

1255
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,730
dialogue but we also need warranting

1256
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,740
that works I've heard so many really

1257
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,140
really good agents over the years say

1258
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,850
the pfizer process is slow I'm trying to

1259
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,290
prevent someone from getting on a plane

1260
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,420
and getting to somewhere where there's

1261
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,920
no extradition or I'm trying to

1262
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,510
prosecute someone who's pulling out of

1263
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,109
money out of a jurisdiction that I can't

1264
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,910
touch so understanding how are we doing

1265
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:22,400
process how are we automating the

1266
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,960
warranting process what information are

1267
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,359
we willing to show the public on a

1268
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,640
transparency basis these are all

1269
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:31,009
questions I think that again can be sort

1270
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,040
of reverse engineered into something

1271
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:36,559
that can be somewhat transparent I will

1272
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,480
say appropriately opaque and so I think

1273
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,220
that's where we're going with data

1274
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,480
sharing and the problem is it doesn't

1275
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:47,029
sound byte very well so it's easy to say

1276
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,010
spying it's a lot harder to say well

1277
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,450
intelligent comparison of analytics

1278
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,549
based on a lot of detail later like

1279
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:55,578
you've lost Jane Pauley she's died on

1280
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:57,349
you you know and God knows what's going

1281
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,030
on on the others news stations right I

1282
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:01,299
didn't know she's still alive actually

1283
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:06,200
it's terrible i'm really dating my she

1284
00:52:01,299 --> 00:52:09,230
go jane pauley really dated myself like

1285
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,569
Jessica Simpson no no she stole thing so

1286
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,400
yeah so we are involved is the is the

1287
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:14,839
short answer to your question and I

1288
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,020
can't tell you a ton of what we're doing

1289
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:20,420
but I am very much involved to the point

1290
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,030
where I've been accused of either being

1291
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,609
a terrorist because i won't give all the

1292
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:29,270
data or being some sort of an

1293
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:31,009
obstructionist because I will I mean

1294
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,710
it's it depends on the day which one I

1295
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:36,650
am but at the end of the day what I said

1296
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:39,650
to both sides is you know a company like

1297
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,869
ours in particular I had a grandma Irma

1298
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,359
blue hair we loved grandma blue hair and

1299
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:45,950
she said you know don't give away your

1300
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:50,750
milk for free if you want to want him to

1301
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:52,220
buy the cow well I've socal I Selecao so

1302
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,290
if you want to buy my cow you want to

1303
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,750
know my analytic and you want data we

1304
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,880
actually can set up a p.o under all the

1305
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,710
right rules under every jurisdiction I

1306
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,880
shouldn't say every because there are

1307
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,410
naughty ones that I can't really talk

1308
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,440
about then they spend billions and

1309
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:09,500
billions on chips and I can't really say

1310
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,720
anything terribly public about that but

1311
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,849
there's a dialogue even there so even

1312
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,808
where there is a culture of 3,000 years

1313
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:20,960
of collectivism it's easy to judge some

1314
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:22,280
of these economies and say they spy on

1315
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,900
everything they look at all the web

1316
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,130
traffic but they also when they have one

1317
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,539
percent unemployment have a

1318
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:29,690
for a million people on their streets

1319
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:31,880
hungry so I try not to i take all the

1320
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,980
kind of judgment off the table and say

1321
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,230
what can we do from a math perspective

1322
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,200
to share risk to keep our collective

1323
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:41,240
world safer and then we at least make

1324
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,189
that progress and then it turns out that

1325
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,779
those harder corner cases are really

1326
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,819
harder corner cases and that's where we

1327
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:49,869
get the really big brains in the rooms

1328
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:54,549
and oftentimes under very strict

1329
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:58,369
clearances so very fudgy word answer

1330
00:53:54,549 --> 00:54:02,180
that's great and and what we'll do we

1331
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:04,099
have videos of our talks and we will we

1332
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:07,430
will include on our web page with a

1333
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:10,309
symposium web page a link to the book so

1334
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:12,710
if you didn't jot it down will provide a

1335
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:17,140
way for you to find it so let's say

1336
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,140
thank you to our speaker and Michelle
