1
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,620
okay alright so I good afternoon welcome

2
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,179
to the serious weekly security seminar

3
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,950
my name is joey and shoe i'm a professor

4
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,800
in the computer science department and

5
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,890
and serious i'm the coordinator of the

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,990
seminar series for this semester and

7
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,860
today is my pleasure to introduce gin

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,740
gin hong he is a PhD student in the

9
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,570
computer science department at purdue

10
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,100
the his advisor is professor zhang yu

11
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:29,169
jung jin jin is interested at

12
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
programming language program analysis

13
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,100
technique and their applications to

14
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,669
detecting malicious behavior and

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,009
vulnerabilities in mobile apps and his

16
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,119
research combines static program

17
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:48,400
analysis text in the GUI analysis so

18
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,800
without further ado thanks for the

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,470
introduction good afternoon everyone my

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,259
name is changing wrong and today I want

21
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,929
to share with you our work I'm detecting

22
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:02,020
instant who user inputs for mobile apps

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,260
this is a joint work with the tutoring

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,199
hughson saying coffee in slabs and the

25
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,149
congee from Georgia Tech and this work

26
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,600
was started when I was an intern in

27
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:19,540
slabs and the was published in user need

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:21,430
security 2015 in this talk I may

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,870
frequently talk about something like

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:29,320
text labels input fields and implements

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,350
you are why deeds or not files so before

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:38,548
we go into the details I want to quickly

33
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:41,950
introduce some terminologies the user

34
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,709
inputs fields and the text labels and

35
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,200
the implements a lot of the users see

36
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,019
when they use the mobile phone it will

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,500
use the mobile apps and in this example

38
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:56,590
we can find out this text label the

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,959
input field and the hint of the improv

40
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,459
field enter the text label and the input

41
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,680
fields are called the UI widgets and

42
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,430
that the layout files are provided by

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,430
the devel

44
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,370
earth to statically defined the UI's and

45
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,650
these files can contain the definitions

46
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,090
of the UI widest as well as certain

47
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,219
attributes as in this example the

48
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,099
identifier of the budget is defined here

49
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,709
and the developers can reference this

50
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,888
why did we are this identifier in the

51
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,639
code and the some interesting attributes

52
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:37,780
here can indicate the expected types of

53
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:41,200
the inputs okay then I want to start our

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:44,019
main talk recently smartphones and

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,488
mobile apps have been an essential part

56
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:50,859
of our lives at the meantime you that

57
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,310
the privacy has become a major concern

58
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:56,919
and the in mobile apps is very common

59
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:01,090
for the apps to disclose the sense to

60
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:04,629
use data to local storages two logs or

61
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,810
to some external public channels like

62
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:11,768
internet but unfortunately such

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,829
disclosures may be hijacked or malicious

64
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:18,120
newfield biodiverse Rees leading to some

65
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:21,310
serious and leakage alluded privacy and

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,610
a lot of research efforts have been

67
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,669
spent on this area but their focus is

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:33,130
not on the sensitive data that are

69
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:35,370
defined by certain api's for example the

70
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,199
APS that can return the phones

71
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,470
identifiers or the you turn the phone's

72
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,909
County location and most of this data a

73
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,000
permission protected together with some

74
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:52,690
approaches that have also published in

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,110
using security 2015 our work is among

76
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,949
the first to detail the user inputs as

77
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:02,560
sensitive sources in mobile apps and

78
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,990
it's very common in for mobile apps to

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,380
have user inputs and the longer them our

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,740
permission protected therefore we need

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,840
to understand the context of the inputs

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,169
to determine whether these inputs are

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,138
sensitive or instant hill one example

84
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:24,188
that the input our credit card

85
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:28,599
is sensitive but the comment for an app

86
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:30,789
is instant to you and for this sensitive

87
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:33,490
you the input the data flow is something

88
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,699
like this the data is achieved in the

89
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,520
code and the later this close to some

90
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,189
public channels like internet but for

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
the internet to user input the data flow

92
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,710
is the same as that how sensitive user

93
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,840
inputs then if we want to do some

94
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:55,779
disclosure analysis we cannot simply we

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,179
cannot simply send out the central

96
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,879
sources by only allies in the code

97
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,310
because both the sensitive and instant

98
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:09,939
view data are obtained through the same

99
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:12,490
AP is in fact if we want to do some such

100
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,919
code analysis we confront several

101
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,949
challenges how to systematically

102
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,068
discover the input fields for me apps

103
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:23,770
you I in how to identify which input

104
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,680
fields are sensitive and how to

105
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,870
associate the sense to input fields to

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,770
the corresponding variables in the apps

107
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,169
that is stole their values and we can

108
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,378
see that the signal one is the key

109
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,628
problem in our work to solve these

110
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:44,409
problems actually we come up with the

111
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:47,379
intuition that a user can simply

112
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:50,620
identify the senator user inputs and

113
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:54,909
insulin to user input win here using

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:58,060
when he uses this mobile apps then if we

115
00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:00,819
can be meek how a user looks at the US

116
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:07,719
then we can also discover this since we

117
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:09,879
input fields fortunately we have some

118
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:13,089
techniques to render the statically

119
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,639
defined layouts to the US and the

120
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:19,180
company the mobile platforms provide

121
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,000
some a kind of strategy defined they are

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,789
formats for the developers to define the

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,460
US and the rapidly developing the

124
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,878
toolkits can render this layout to the

125
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:34,229
US the rent of the UI is close to what

126
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,940
the users see on the smartphone screens

127
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:40,270
with the rent of the UI we can then

128
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,850
associate the text labels to the input

129
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:47,979
fields based on some physical locations

130
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:50,980
or based on some techniques here you may

131
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,680
want to ask why we do not use the xml

132
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,200
file or xmas structure directly to

133
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,780
associate the text labels to the input

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:04,120
fields here some here some reason that

135
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,549
many developers define the relative

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,630
positions of the white kids which

137
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,520
allowed what users pursue in this case

138
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,230
xmas structure does not guarantee you

139
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,450
that 7ey deeds are physically close and

140
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,330
the virtual position to load intuitively

141
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:26,170
through the correlation on the UI for

142
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:30,010
example there are two labels p and c and

143
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:33,640
one input field a in the position that

144
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,990
defined as p is above a and the C is

145
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:41,348
levity of a then we cannot to residency

146
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:47,320
that with the P or C is correlated to

147
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:51,400
the input field a and we also see some

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,390
real cases in Android apps that they

149
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:58,959
define the US by column instead of by

150
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,510
row for example for this table like you

151
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,170
I usually defined by rule like that

152
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,260
means in the xml file input one is close

153
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:11,170
to label one and input e2 is close to

154
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,020
label too but some developers defined

155
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,630
like this they put the two labels

156
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,980
together and the two input fields

157
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,260
together and in such cases if we divert

158
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,800
you the xmas truck shows the xmas trees

159
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,670
we cannot tell which phil Wickham

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:35,859
prefilled are correlated to which text

161
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:38,949
labels then based on the intuition we

162
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,350
propose super which is a princess and a

163
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:46,690
scalable approach to detect instance to

164
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,740
use inputs in mobile apps this is the

165
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,190
whole wheel of soup

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:55,300
her super takes as input a mobile app

167
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,160
and outputs the bindings of the center

168
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,969
using puts handed the variable in the

169
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,100
code to enable some further analysis and

170
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,430
the stupid itself consists of three

171
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,830
parts the first line is to start only

172
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,550
passing the layouts and when doing that

173
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,560
leads to the UI's the Institute which

174
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,609
has to determine the sensitiveness of

175
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,560
the input fields at the end it tries to

176
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:25,290
banish the discovered a senator user

177
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,359
inputs to the variables in the code at

178
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,490
the very beginning we need to low which

179
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,040
layered files contain input fields

180
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,320
because we don't want to spend effort on

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,199
those layered files that do not contain

182
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:44,470
any input fields and with this initial

183
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,620
discoveries super can render the lead

184
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,840
file to the US and the US are closed to

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,780
what is the users see on the smartphone

186
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,980
screens they can use some tools like

187
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:59,470
they are ADT Android for example if we

188
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,990
win the layout file a we can get this

189
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:09,310
but if we win the layout be we can get

190
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:12,220
this with the render the UI super can

191
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,420
are extracted is important information

192
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,750
for subsequent use for the box area

193
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,380
super can get the text the hint and the

194
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,960
outlet of the you are wages the text in

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,790
the hints are what is the users see on

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,610
the smartphone screen but the crew

197
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:36,670
outlets are used to associated the text

198
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:39,250
labels to the input fields with all the

199
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,189
with all the information regarding we

200
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,930
can now determine whether an English

201
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,040
field can contain sensitive information

202
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:52,089
or not this user Swiss steps to news

203
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:56,199
analysis at first we want to see if an

204
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,750
attribute of the whitest definition can

205
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,250
indicate the data is sensitive this

206
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:05,950
example shows a senator into the field

207
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,980
but if the sensitiveness can not be

208
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,490
determined by this simple step we need

209
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,180
to show that if the hint of the Imperial

210
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:20,680
can contain some sensitive keywords

211
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:23,349
enough for example in some apps the hint

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,589
can tell the user to enter password and

213
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,070
in our previous examples the hint it

214
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,460
held the user how to enter the data into

215
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,760
the hint contains sensitive keywords the

216
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,880
input field is viewed as soon until but

217
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,490
if not we need to unless the

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,450
corresponding text label to see if the

219
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:49,390
text label contains metal key words in

220
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,780
our previous examples the text label

221
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,770
comment but lot does not match any

222
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,260
sensible keywords then it indicates an

223
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,410
instance that you impute but the labels

224
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:06,910
card number and expiration date can

225
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,060
indicate sensory input field the first

226
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,280
two steps are simple but here comes a

227
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,859
challenge that how to precisely

228
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,680
associate the correlated takes the label

229
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:23,050
to a given input field for the third

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,810
step I intuition that the labels at a

231
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,959
different position relative to the input

232
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:32,439
field have different probabilities to be

233
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,630
correlated here are some examples the

234
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,140
labels can be at left how at the right

235
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,310
of the in the field it can also be above

236
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:45,760
or below the impetus field then we can

237
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,579
design the position based waste to the

238
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,770
labels at different positions and the

239
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,180
smaller the weight the closer the

240
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:57,850
correlation in fact we divided the UI

241
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:03,280
plane into land parts based on the

242
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:06,480
borders of the input field and the

243
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:10,540
labels I'd lived of the infield and

244
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,970
about the infield how are most possible

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,829
to be correlated but in the labels at

246
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,020
the bottom caller

247
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:22,060
the right apartment Cola are mostly

248
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:24,970
impossible to be correlated then too

249
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:29,170
sure how the taste label is associated

250
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:32,700
with the infield we design a geometry

251
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,010
based correlation score computation

252
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,650
forgiven in this field and takes the

253
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,920
label with the loan co or delays we

254
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,709
first compute the correlation score for

255
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,469
each pixel this computation takes into

256
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,500
account both the distance and the

257
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,260
position based the weight and with this

258
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,630
a correlation score for each p so we can

259
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:01,990
compute an average score for the text

260
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:04,560
label but usually and input field may

261
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,670
have more than one alternative labels

262
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,829
super selects in the one with the

263
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:15,729
smallest correlations goal-line example

264
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:18,070
you that in this example both fields cut

265
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,640
lumber and is variation dead house three

266
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:26,250
alternatives and the correlation scores

267
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:30,460
are computed here based on our policy

268
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,920
the label cut lumber is associated with

269
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,440
the lumber field and the label

270
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:43,349
expiration date is associated with the

271
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:46,120
dead field now we have the taste for the

272
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,970
we have the label taste for each in the

273
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,740
field we want to determine whether this

274
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,650
input field can contain sensitive data

275
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,800
we propose a simple keyword matching

276
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:00,100
approach with a predefined sent to kill

277
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,099
the data set in the examples the label

278
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,740
cut lumber and experiment eight matches

279
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,200
these sensitive keywords then those two

280
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:13,900
in fields are still but the label

281
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,240
comment does not much innocent who cured

282
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:21,189
then the corresponding field is

283
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,240
instantly now I want to show how we

284
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:28,540
build the keyword data set we crawled

285
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,410
more than 50,000 apps to get

286
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,500
all the text in these apps and you can

287
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,910
study this text into words and all

288
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,490
freezes we are some NLP techniques and

289
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:46,480
we choose the we selected the top

290
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,610
frequent words or phrases and the manual

291
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,750
inspected these woods and 3ds took it

292
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,270
and initial sent to Cuba data set next

293
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,350
we added a certain image of this latex

294
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:01,720
enter keywords to the data set now we

295
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:06,099
finished to build this until Q the data

296
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:09,480
set you may want to ask is it it's

297
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:12,250
negative or why it is effect effective

298
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,960
you by using this simple keyword

299
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,970
matching approach it is fake too because

300
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,550
written lee the smartphones the

301
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,400
smartphone screens are usually small and

302
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:27,129
the frigid or the sentences are usually

303
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,160
short and we find out the most

304
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:33,280
irrelevant takes a label and we only

305
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:39,160
allows the text in that label instead of

306
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:42,340
a line mainly labels after determining

307
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,410
which input fields are still until we

308
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,419
want to bandit that the discover the

309
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,670
Senate will proceed to the variables in

310
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,470
the code to enable some of further code

311
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:57,070
analysis and they identifiers our

312
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,530
reference in the code which helps super

313
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,409
to find out their corresponding

314
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:07,149
variables in the code but one problem is

315
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,700
that different layout files in a knife

316
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,700
they have improved with the same

317
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,990
identifier for example in this example

318
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:19,420
the input one for the cut lumber is

319
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:23,850
sunil but the in the one for this search

320
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,980
keyword is insulin too so if we directly

321
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:30,510
associated they identified to the code

322
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,580
directly then we cannot distinguish the

323
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,330
references are sensitive user inputs to

324
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,810
the insulative once we solve this

325
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,340
problem by leveraging some kind of

326
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,470
backward slicing

327
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,990
in this example we knew that input the

328
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,690
one can be either sensitive or instant

329
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:54,250
you and we can find out all the

330
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:56,279
references are implying the code then in

331
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,900
order to find out which reference is

332
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:02,679
corresponding to the is correlated to

333
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,200
the sensitive in blue one we find out

334
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,020
what the backward slices for all the

335
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,549
references for the first reference the

336
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,150
pack of water / is something like this

337
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,908
and by further checking this slice we

338
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,010
can confirm that the impetus one here is

339
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,500
associated with the watch is defined in

340
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,049
the art building information instead of

341
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,529
the watch is defined in the layout

342
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,658
search then super candy markedly

343
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:33,010
corresponding variable text into the one

344
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:35,970
else until for the second reference the

345
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:39,279
seamless last can be found like this and

346
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:42,820
then the watch it is actually associated

347
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,460
with layout search therefore the

348
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:51,490
corresponding a variable in the code is

349
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:53,760
innocent until now I want to have a

350
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,799
short summary of our design our super

351
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,710
super typhoon epatha the layout files

352
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,250
and the renders the load files to some

353
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,830
you is then super associates the text

354
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,899
label to the input fields and the

355
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,510
determined that determines the

356
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:13,029
centralist of the english fields at the

357
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,590
end superb and to the discover the

358
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,809
senator input field through the

359
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,770
variables in the code to enable some

360
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:23,529
further code analysis and based on the

361
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,960
design we build super on top of some

362
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:29,799
existing tools and only for n to the

363
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,710
apps and that we limited the type how in

364
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:35,440
the fields to a small settling you the

365
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,500
inputs in android apps instead of ln all

366
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,110
possible you to input in the apps and

367
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,630
the we also implemented us into using

368
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,168
push disclosure detection system to

369
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,830
demonstrate the usefulness of super and

370
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:53,429
evaluated the super end of the system on

371
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,428
16 stolen apps

372
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,789
the US Senate to analysis part including

373
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,690
rendering their layouts for all the

374
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:08,690
layouts in an app is quite efficient

375
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:12,289
more than ninety six percent held apps

376
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:14,779
requires less than 10 seconds for this

377
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:17,600
part and that the average analysis time

378
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:23,269
for one app is only five point seven

379
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:28,219
second and we abandon examined 40 apps

380
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:31,399
of the ABS with the input field and find

381
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,200
out nearly 500 impress fields we defined

382
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:36,229
to party with false positives and false

383
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,320
negative as follows if a sunny to user

384
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,889
input is identified sensitive it's a two

385
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:47,120
party if an instant to use input is

386
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:49,158
identified sanity is a false positive if

387
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,939
the center user inputs is identified

388
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,789
instant hill is forced negative and we

389
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,840
use recall and precision to describe the

390
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:02,480
accuracy both both of them are 97 23%

391
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,830
that means we have low false positive

392
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:11,659
rate and a false negative rate and for

393
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:14,379
the 40 apps we examined actually 140 lat

394
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:17,570
input fields are identified sensitive

395
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:19,969
once third of these identified input

396
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,918
fields are identified by analyzing the

397
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:27,470
interesting attributes and a 27-point

398
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,019
27.5 percent of them identified by

399
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,820
matching the implements to the central

400
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:36,350
keyword data set and we can see that

401
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,509
38.8 line percent of the input fields

402
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,320
are identified by analyzing the

403
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:44,690
corresponding text labels this indicates

404
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,220
the importance of associating the

405
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,750
creative labels to the input fields and

406
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,830
we have some false positives and false

407
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:57,110
negatives one calls for the fourth party

408
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,259
was enforced negatively that super does

409
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:04,719
not have sufficient context to identify

410
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:08,150
the senator keywords for example

411
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,830
security answer is a predefined senator

412
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:15,290
cured but in some apps the US only have

413
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:17,600
answer instead of security answer but

414
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,600
answer is equal to security answer

415
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,389
within that context but answer is too

416
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,870
general so super does not consider

417
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:30,170
answer as a son who cured then this make

418
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:34,129
deal to some false negatives and in some

419
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:37,130
other cases hate our human being is

420
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:41,300
sensitive but hate how an image file or

421
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,630
an or a PDF file is instant view but we

422
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,909
treat hate as a single keyword then this

423
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,870
make was to this may cause some force

424
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:54,190
party with in some cases in addition to

425
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,899
the keyword part super sometimes

426
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,780
increasingly associated the text labels

427
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,050
to the input field that may lead to some

428
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:06,050
false positives this is an example in

429
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:09,169
this example we have one label this is a

430
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,790
long sentence and a two input fields the

431
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:15,080
email address and the delivery

432
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,510
instructions in fact this long sentence

433
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,960
is a supplemental description of the

434
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,670
email field but when super tries to

435
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,600
determine the sensitiveness of the

436
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:29,150
deliver instruction field it cannot say

437
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,600
that this field is sensitive by only

438
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,660
allowing the hint of this field viduals

439
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,649
how to find out a label of this field

440
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:42,680
and ink unfortunately it is associated

441
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:48,500
is long sentence to the delivery

442
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:51,520
instruction and this Longinus happens to

443
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,140
have the Senate who cured email then

444
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,590
Supermax list in the region so she has a

445
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:04,040
sensitive user inputs this is a true

446
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:06,139
party if this is a fourth party for the

447
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,250
you send to user inputs disclosure

448
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:13,970
analysis part the whole throughput is

449
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:17,150
about 11 apps per minute on the class of

450
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,960
80 servers with the three apps allows on

451
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,980
each server in parallel and we manually

452
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,100
examines

453
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,450
104 apps funny that the first part to

454
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,219
rate is about eight point seven percent

455
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,100
in addition to the area's identify

456
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,140
instant to user input the limitations of

457
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,490
the underlying tenth analysis swim work

458
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,500
is a major cause of the four spot heels

459
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,960
we do not completely false negatives out

460
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,510
of this part because we do not how I'll

461
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,600
require all the apps and it's not easy

462
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:54,049
to track the data flows Menuhin in the

463
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:58,928
apps so we only have the fourth power to

464
00:25:54,049 --> 00:26:02,299
read here and here are some real cases

465
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:05,929
in the first one the weight the hate and

466
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,299
the age identified as sensitive and in

467
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,210
the signal one the credit card lumber

468
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:13,460
they cut lombourg's the secret lover and

469
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,150
the whole doesn't name I identify the

470
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,340
sent you and these data are discovered

471
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:23,270
to be disclosed to some public channels

472
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:27,520
these two cases and the two images are

473
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:32,870
rendered badly by super instead of a

474
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,600
snippet by at around half and we also

475
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,418
use a carefully examine is the 44 apps

476
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,000
among the 100 flaps that is gender

477
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:45,500
sensitive user inputs via network we

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,960
found that only 10 apps adopt https

479
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:51,020
connections that means mostly

480
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,169
transmission is in the ives implant

481
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:57,049
taste we are HTTP we cannot say that

482
00:26:54,169 --> 00:27:01,549
disc disclosures are malicious but such

483
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:07,970
behaviors may need to some privacy

484
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:11,540
leakage of the user sensitive data next

485
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:15,799
I want to talk about some related work

486
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:19,250
this UI pica is also published in usenix

487
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:21,799
security 2015 and it also aims at

488
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,309
detecting listen to user inputs in

489
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:29,120
mobile apps I want to compare super and

490
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:32,230
the UI pika from several aspects for

491
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,750
building the essential keyword data set

492
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,020
super uses the top of frequent central q

493
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,810
and add some synonyms of the selected

494
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,120
keywords uip could discover the keywords

495
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:48,950
we are machine learning technique based

496
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:51,199
on an initial keyword data set and the

497
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,870
counter version of super only focus on

498
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,750
the small said how they input it has a

499
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:59,330
smooth settle the user inputs but the UI

500
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:04,340
pika focuses on more types of user

501
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:09,710
inputs and the win determine if the user

502
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:12,770
inputs as a senator or not super focuses

503
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,710
on the interesting attributes and the

504
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,710
matches try to match the input hints to

505
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:23,510
the central cute latina said unit into

506
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,970
these 20 areas to these two fields you I

507
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:30,500
pick also uses the layers descriptions

508
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:33,310
to see if the equally corresponding

509
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,140
input field Arsenal to four examples

510
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:40,090
some names all the references may

511
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:43,580
contain some scented keywords like the

512
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,740
limo the ID might be added password then

513
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,710
this indicated that the improv field is

514
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,170
a password field or this is added in

515
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,970
bill it indicates that the field is

516
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:58,250
email field and we can improve super by

517
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:03,110
taking into such information into

518
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:05,360
account in the future if both approaches

519
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:10,300
cannot determine the sensitive list of

520
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:13,540
the infield violently into the

521
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:17,810
attributes the hints or the descriptions

522
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:21,409
we have we need to associate a label to

523
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:24,169
the infield supercharged to find out the

524
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:27,260
most correlated label in the rent of the

525
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,960
UI but you are pico uses the same

526
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,750
burning labels in the XML files instead

527
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,800
of the fiscal closed all the most

528
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:39,560
correlated then this approach may feel

529
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,919
in some cases that defined the widest

530
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:46,810
using relative positions or in some

531
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,810
cases that I told earlier

532
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:54,379
next hour at the end I to conclude our

533
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:56,900
work we started the possibility of

534
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,900
detecting sent to user inputs which is

535
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,690
important but most indignation send to

536
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:06,380
sources in mobile apps and the best are

537
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,929
up intuition we propose super which is

538
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,570
among the first low approaches to detail

539
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:15,620
sent to using pools and it has a high

540
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:18,559
recall and precision rate super mimics

541
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,039
from the users perspective by statically

542
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,889
rendering the layout file to us and the

543
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:27,830
in language is geometry based computer

544
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:31,100
approach to precise associated the text

545
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:34,908
labels to increase fields at the end it

546
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:37,100
utilizes the test textual analysis to

547
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:42,909
determine the sensitiveness of the test

548
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,408
in the labels in addition to or

549
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:47,179
evaluated super we also perform a

550
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:49,789
sensitive usually impose these Chloe

551
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,610
analysis and the first part to rate is

552
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:56,408
about eight point seven percent this is

553
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:59,209
to demonstrate the usefulness of super

554
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:01,840
and that's all thank you and any

555
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,840
questions

556
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:14,120
thank you for the talk um could you

557
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,879
please expand on how you got the weights

558
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,729
for the distances that the text label

559
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,730
would be from the blank ok

560
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,700
you mean this fact how we get in a ways

561
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:41,149
actually at first we tried a lot of

562
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,470
approaches and at the end we just

563
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:47,040
manually assign some weights based on

564
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:50,490
observations and we try to advantage

565
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:53,129
these assignments to a lot of apps to

566
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,560
see if these weights works and the

567
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:02,190
actually they works fine so we use these

568
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:13,800
ways okay thank you and now the

569
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:18,200
questions what is the next step of what

570
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,200
is the next level 20 by 95

571
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,139
when we identify the center user inputs

572
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:29,570
in the ABS what is the next step the

573
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:31,850
next step is we try to pander the

574
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,989
sensory input field to the variables in

575
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:38,478
the code we we know that these employers

576
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:41,869
are sent you but we'll be able to know

577
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:44,539
or the locations of the references in

578
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:47,029
the code to include some to enable some

579
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:55,309
destroyed analysis or some vulnerability

580
00:32:47,029 --> 00:33:05,869
analysis so the leg step is finding the

581
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:08,149
variable through the code here which

582
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:11,928
input is it referring to what do you

583
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:15,889
offer once you then you can just just

584
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:17,840
written any application I don't quite

585
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:20,209
understand your question can you get it

586
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,299
so you did you use your mother found out

587
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,299
there please I know the person in there

588
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,720
so my question is once you've identified

589
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,209
the input fields which are sensitive

590
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,220
then you bind it to the text fields

591
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,929
which which according to one of the

592
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,210
three approaches that you discussed once

593
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:52,769
you do that then the whole up finding

594
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,450
you can directly deploy it as it is on a

595
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:57,509
nap or do you need to use some other

596
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,200
findings on it to make it something that

597
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:03,869
you can deploy directly on a nap well

598
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,730
you see that after we identify this

599
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:07,709
sense of user inputs and the Bandit is

600
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:14,099
in fulfilled to the variable in the code

601
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:16,649
then this is the end of super but we can

602
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,829
average such information to do some code

603
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:22,049
analysis because we do that which

604
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,669
variables are sensitive then we can

605
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:32,040
track the data flows all the essential

606
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:34,500
variables okay is it clear yeah does

607
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,980
this application provide any security to

608
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,139
the app mobile apps or he suggests the

609
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,369
analysis of what is sensitive and what

610
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:46,770
is insensitive it is just a lysis of

611
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:49,290
what incentive of incidence and we also

612
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,569
perform a further analysis to see

613
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,668
whether this sensitive data are this

614
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,799
close to some public channels it is a

615
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:59,339
static approach is just a static program

616
00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:02,640
analysis if we extended this approach to

617
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:05,578
a dynamic program Eliza we maybe we can

618
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,270
and try to alerting the user that to

619
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,530
tell the users some sin 2 theta

620
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,319
disclosed to some public channels and

621
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:19,109
the users can did need to go or just

622
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:23,549
stop it music on you thank you any other

623
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:25,020
questions what a what format do you need

624
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:27,990
to take the applications in in order for

625
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,619
them to be analyzed by super what format

626
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,828
of the applications we can use in super

627
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,210
rad so so how do you need the

628
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,530
applications can you just pull them down

629
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,589
from the store do you need the source

630
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:44,369
code or the UK in the case Android

631
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:46,630
company we derivative 11v APK file of

632
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:53,740
the android apps

633
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:56,340
to load APK files okay so is this answer

634
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,339
to your question

635
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:10,109
didn't do anything yes okay does this

636
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:14,020
work at the time side or the server side

637
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,370
or clan Assad side yeah are you going to

638
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,900
extend it to the server side with it

639
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,620
seems like it would be a better idea to

640
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,210
analyze applications from that side a

641
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,490
big apposite or what do you mean by

642
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,380
client side or suicide because I mean

643
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,660
this is a standard long torso you can

644
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,720
apply it to every where you can apply it

645
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,060
everywhere yeah sure for example if I

646
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,069
want to analyze a website that i'm using

647
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,549
for how secure and how much of my data

648
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:47,140
its sharing or how secure my data is on

649
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:50,080
that website this can work I can we can

650
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,770
use me to the suicide of that you can

651
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,779
upload one APK file to as the input of

652
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,870
this tool and then it will tell you the

653
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:04,210
results of the disclosures or the

654
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:10,870
Sentinelese and you can apply to the app

655
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:13,930
multi stores to allows a lot of a lot of

656
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,960
apps and until which apps have some

657
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:19,540
palate is closed and then we can notify

658
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,000
the developers of these problems well as

659
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:26,740
a developer you can use this to two

660
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,480
hours you're your own apps and see if

661
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,850
they are some disclosure or politics

662
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:36,310
disclosure paths then you can improve

663
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:39,190
your own apps is it can you thank you so

664
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,710
any other questions how do you stored

665
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:44,380
information you find on the app's there

666
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,660
are sending information to improve a

667
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:52,640
channel we have the airwaves of

668
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:56,759
information on the app's and in 1080p

669
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,690
you mean do it find some information

670
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:03,270
next is some years on that I'm find

671
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,599
actually sending sensitive information

672
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:13,710
to provision to public channels like

673
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:18,750
HTTP yeah I mean you said you have 60

674
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:21,930
have maps how many you say that many of

675
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,660
them can send information through polish

676
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:28,618
chance right yet we have the information

677
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:35,930
on those apps that makes a good level to

678
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:40,020
the information to these Lee we do not

679
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:42,779
find if this these closures are ruining

680
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:47,460
the cage we just say that if there are

681
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:49,619
some essential information artist send

682
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,410
it to some public channels but we do not

683
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,440
see if these are bad at all good plus

684
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,930
for some apps they use ID or password

685
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,920
arsonists through HTTP to the servers

686
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:05,910
for verification all such cases are

687
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,970
viewed as a disclosure we just say that

688
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:14,879
if these are bad or good or usually are

689
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:17,549
intended well the answer your question

690
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,970
yeah obviously you have always been

691
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:32,619
provisionally have the resources we have

692
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:35,250
to publish the information low so in

693
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:35,250
other questions

694
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,110
so if you don't have any other questions

695
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:48,990
then we can enter this similar earlier

696
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:51,320
in this thank you for attending this

697
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,319
