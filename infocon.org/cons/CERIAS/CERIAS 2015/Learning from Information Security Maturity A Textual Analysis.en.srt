00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,160
you

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:27,079
look good hello and welcome to this

3
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,418
week's serious security seminar from

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,360
Purdue University our presenter today is

5
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:34,640
dr. Jackie resole Murr a serious

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,559
affiliate affiliate Pro fessor in the

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,360
management information systems program

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,909
of krannert graduate school of

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,489
management here at Purdue University

10
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:47,360
Jackie thanks Joel well good afternoon

11
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:50,599
everyone I play you can all see in here

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm Jackie summer and I'm an associate

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,379
professor over in the krannert school in

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,180
the Information Systems Group and my

15
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,759
research arian information security has

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,089
been primarily on risk management and

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:09,290
security policy so this talk I'm about

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:11,689
to give is pretty fresh it's some

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,170
extremely early work that we are doing

20
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:19,880
with the building security in maturity

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,130
model version 5 professor spafford first

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,408
alerted me to this a while ago while

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,479
chatting about something and it is

24
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,640
turned into a really rich research

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,619
opportunity particularly for us in the

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,350
business school because it really is

27
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,990
focused on the management of security

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,699
and technologies a huge part of that but

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,589
as you all know it's usually the people

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,719
that screw something up somewhere down

31
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,819
the line or allow something to be

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,818
screwed up somewhere down the line so

33
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:53,929
this is research so it's really early we

34
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,539
first presented this work December well

35
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,219
about a month ago December nineteenth at

36
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,959
the workshop for information

37
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,369
technologies and systems in Auckland New

38
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,100
Zealand and got a little bit of feedback

39
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,770
so this is the second time and this is

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,380
work that I'm actually doing with a team

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,720
of four undergraduate students over in

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,940
the School of Management we don't have a

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,000
course that's dedicated to information

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,680
security so I just got some that were

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,860
interested in interested in the research

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,110
process and they are Kyle Harris you he

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,250
Douglas head who just graduated in

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,100
december and wishy or emma song so they

49
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,040
get a lot of the credit for this what we

50
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,420
were

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,269
what some of my previous research has

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,929
done is we've looked at the things that

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,170
firms say when it comes information

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,200
security so we have looked at the

55
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,329
textural disclosures that firms make and

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,839
there's a whole literature behind what

57
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,780
firms say what they do there's a cost to

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,810
making a statement that may give away a

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,940
position that you have in the firm so

60
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,740
firms only do this if the benefit is

61
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,560
going to be greater to the cost and when

62
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,690
we talk about these costs we're talking

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,730
about the legal statements that firm

64
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,430
make in the United States to the

65
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,070
securities exchange commission so these

66
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,100
are the things that firms have to say we

67
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:22,160
face risk we face market risks we face

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:26,019
credit risk and we face operational risk

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,130
and this is so that the shirt

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,800
shareholders and other stakeholders can

71
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,190
make informed decisions now as a firm

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,980
you want everything to be rosy and

73
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,230
awesome so people will not only buy your

74
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,980
products and services but also invest in

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,230
your company in terms of equity and

76
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,480
bonds and things like this so you want

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,179
to present a really positive picture

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,579
however you also don't want to be sued

79
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:59,440
for not sharing all the information that

80
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,870
is reasonable to share so firms are

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,350
hesitant to say more than they have to

82
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,690
about the risks but we find that firms

83
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:12,890
actually kind of forward-looking firms

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:15,170
tend to disclose quite a few risks they

85
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,209
don't say that I think some hacker in

86
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,668
Albania is going to break in at ten

87
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,290
o'clock on a Thursday night but they say

88
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:27,200
things like our systems are at risk for

89
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,870
malicious activity and we actually did a

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,200
previous study with some former graduate

91
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:38,150
students where we did find that actually

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,250
firms that disclose information relative

93
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,909
to information security risks actually

94
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,520
tend to do better when there's an

95
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,349
adverse

96
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,810
event against their company in terms of

97
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:51,780
being hammered on their stock prices so

98
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,879
you know it's so basically you say hey

99
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,969
you know companies are made up of human

100
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,340
beings things are going to happen we're

101
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,620
prepared for it when they do happen so

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,239
we have good incidents response and

103
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,729
we're going to try to do everything to

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,860
protect but when bad things happen we're

105
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,740
going to rebound really quickly and the

106
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,289
stock market rewards that we also looked

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,610
at the options market and we got a

108
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:20,759
similar story where what we know to be

109
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,470
informed investors know these things

110
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,130
happen the company's going to manage as

111
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,479
well as I can you know it's fine we're

112
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,880
kind of your day traders you're naive

113
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,270
investors have trouble differentiating

114
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,819
these signals in the market but overall

115
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,270
things kind of wash out for these firms

116
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,789
which is good in that market so we were

117
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,609
looking at things firm say through text

118
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,219
analysis or text mining so in this

119
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,300
project the besom project we're thinking

120
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:54,539
well you know to participate in these

121
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,250
activities is quite a statement about

122
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,800
how you approach security these are

123
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,880
firms that you know are really willing

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:08,639
to do what they can to improve their

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,099
security posture so so we look at the

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,319
Texas well as some other numerical and

127
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,389
ordinal data so we're looking at

128
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,849
particularly at the building security in

129
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,219
maturity model version 5 there are

130
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,289
several previous versions and this is

131
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:24,870
all publicly available information and

132
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,479
it what's interesting to us it's really

133
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,250
an industry driven model these are firms

134
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,919
that come together and say hey you know

135
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,810
you know what are the best practices for

136
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,818
us how can we say that you know we're

137
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:41,130
really mature in the way we think and

138
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,740
it's real focus is on secure software

139
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,680
development but when we look at it as

140
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,900
managers we say this actually applies to

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,240
your entire security posture even though

142
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,880
that was not the original intent of the

143
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,600
of the model so we say really from a

144
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,100
research

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,380
perspective I could say that this is

146
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,660
really generalizable to other tasks and

147
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,270
we know nothing exists in a vacuum right

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,620
if you have secure software development

149
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,810
if you don't have strong network

150
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,360
security you know you're still at

151
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:18,120
substantial risk right so it's not been

152
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,250
studied academically at least from the

153
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,500
business school perspective previously

154
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,540
so this is pretty cool but it does share

155
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,510
a lot of similarities with other pretty

156
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,740
well study maturity models one that many

157
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,310
of us in the business school are

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,440
familiar with is the software capability

159
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,310
maturity model out of Carnegie Mellon

160
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,070
where they have the five levels of

161
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,130
process maturity from the you're flying

162
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,820
by the seat of your pants at level 1 to

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,770
level 5 where you are extremely well

164
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,560
focused on the process and you have

165
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,320
procedures in place to manage your

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,880
really truly focusing on quality

167
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,770
assurance which makes sense not only for

168
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,750
security but or software but also

169
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,990
security we see at the business school

170
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,380
in other ways too there's a new product

171
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,960
development model there's project

172
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,730
management maturity models there's you

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,599
know these are pretty well established

174
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:22,800
in the business school literature but

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,390
the idea is you may have and this

176
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,220
doesn't have to apply to every single

177
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,680
process you often will have some

178
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,110
processes that are at one level and

179
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,799
others that are at maybe a more advanced

180
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:38,159
or less mature level so this has five

181
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,919
levels the BCM model is going to have

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,380
three levels so it's a simpler model

183
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,680
which has a lot of advantages the

184
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,390
research that has come you know as

185
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,400
business people we tend to ask how much

186
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,860
is this going to cost and what is the

187
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,800
value I'm going to get back and going

188
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,540
you know from the lower levels to the

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,979
higher levels generally say if you're

190
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,260
going from a very low level to the next

191
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,210
level there's a huge payoff given the

192
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,000
investment required it becomes really

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,100
questionable going from say level 4 to

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,860
level 5 and so we want to ask the same

195
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,360
questions of the besom model

196
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,350
actually we won't accomplish that in

197
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,779
this research but is it worth being at a

198
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,120
level three in the BCM model versus a

199
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,010
level two given the cost it's going to

200
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,410
take to be there and that may not be an

201
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,670
answerable question even at the current

202
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:30,529
point in time so about the model we

203
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,500
mentioned that there's going to be these

204
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,450
four levels there are firms that

205
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,540
participate in the development of the

206
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,360
model and this is where we're actually

207
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,640
looking for a lot more information but

208
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,320
there is the option for anonymous

209
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,360
participation so we don't know the names

210
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,420
of all those firms which from a research

211
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,730
perspective makes things a fun and

212
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,430
challenging but there are 47 identified

213
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,440
firms including some very big players

214
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,209
and they're not all tech firms but all

215
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,250
these firms obviously are very reliant

216
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,920
upon technology for their successful

217
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:08,170
operations so we see insurance we see

218
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:12,410
financial services we see technology

219
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:19,459
systems and other processors these are

220
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:22,399
just some of the firms and so the cool

221
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:23,689
thing about these knowing at least 47 of

222
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,310
the firm's is we can collect a lot of

223
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,199
data about the firm's themselves and

224
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,399
just kind of look a bit into their

225
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,829
management so there are three levels of

226
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,690
maturity as I've mentioned across four

227
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:38,269
domains and these four domains are

228
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,550
governance intelligence secured

229
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,000
development software development

230
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,519
lifecycle touch points are kind of steps

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,269
along your development lifecycle and

232
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,250
then deployment so there's these four

233
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,880
domains and they each have three levels

234
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:59,870
of maturity and there's a bit more so

235
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,540
about each one governance is just the we

236
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,490
think of them as rules for engagement in

237
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,760
the firm but practices that help us

238
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,160
manage a security initiative including

239
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,050
staffing which is something that we're

240
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,660
also interested in the management school

241
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,569
how do you staff and not just stopping

242
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,850
your technology functions or IT

243
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,819
management network management functions

244
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,559
but what happens

245
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:31,179
at the high levels of the firm what

246
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:35,449
happens if your c-suite your CEO coo CFO

247
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:38,499
do you have the CIO do you have a CISO

248
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:41,988
do you have a chief privacy officer

249
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:43,850
firms that do you tend to do better but

250
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:47,509
that's something that we found

251
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,729
interesting intelligence are really your

252
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:52,399
knowledge management practices about

253
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:54,799
information security how do you maintain

254
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,869
the organizational memory because people

255
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,819
cycle through your organization that's

256
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:00,619
actually very healthy to have people

257
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,969
being promoted into new roles people are

258
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,549
going to come in and people are going to

259
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,739
be people are going to retire and how

260
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:10,249
accessible are people using those

261
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:13,579
repositories as needed and then SSD L

262
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:17,509
touchpoints these are your practices

263
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:20,269
your project management practices more

264
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:23,119
or less within these secure software

265
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,369
development environments and last but

266
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:28,789
not least deployment that is really you

267
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:31,909
know implementing and managing secure

268
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,909
software so those four domains each has

269
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:38,749
three practices so we're getting kind of

270
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:40,639
a cube like structure going here each

271
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:44,239
practice area has six to twelve

272
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,639
activities that are kind of clustered

273
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:49,399
into different maturity levels and we're

274
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,609
making an assumption and there's not a

275
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,609
really great way to test this yet but

276
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:58,549
something that my colleagues thought was

277
00:12:55,609 --> 00:13:00,499
interesting is you know if you are at a

278
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:02,209
level three does that mean you're at a

279
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,039
level one or two we're making the

280
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,839
assumption yes because we haven't seen

281
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,789
any counter examples but they may be out

282
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,659
there and we just haven't found them yet

283
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:14,539
so this is a screenshot from just the

284
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:17,989
website that kind of clarifies how this

285
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:21,559
is structured in terms of there are the

286
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:23,689
four domains going across the top row

287
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,089
there and then there are the three

288
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:28,909
practice areas which within each of the

289
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:32,059
four domains so governance has strategy

290
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:34,549
and metrics it has compliance and

291
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,810
policies or security policies and also

292
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,640
training

293
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,430
than in intelligence these are things

294
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,930
from attack models to security features

295
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,290
and designs are standards and

296
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,120
requirements SS vo touch points

297
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,150
architecture analysis code review

298
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,839
security testing and then deployment

299
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:56,510
your penetration testing your software

300
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,960
environment and configuration management

301
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,270
and your vulnerability management

302
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,860
activities so if you were to go to the

303
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,319
website you can drill down and see each

304
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,620
of the activities which end within each

305
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,720
of the four domains and three practice

306
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,760
areas so just to blow up one box here is

307
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,279
the compliance and policy to always

308
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,880
think is an interesting thing to look at

309
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,960
within firms so you can see there's a

310
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,150
objectives activities for each

311
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,550
objectives and then a maturity level

312
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,860
whether these are in one two or three

313
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,290
and each one is nicely labeled which

314
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,020
makes us happy when we're doing data

315
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,689
analysis to see that each objective and

316
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,540
activity is nicely neatly rolled for us

317
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,220
so thanks be some people that's so

318
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,270
awesome for us but this gives you an

319
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,430
idea of some of the activities that

320
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,960
might be in each of these boxes so what

321
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,550
we're trying to do we're trying to do

322
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,190
everything but our broad goal is we want

323
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,709
to at least for now we want to see what

324
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,200
differentiates firms that we know are

325
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:08,360
really actively engaged in the bsm model

326
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,250
and those that are not so this trying to

327
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,600
answer this question is problematic for

328
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,290
a number of reasons we'll get into those

329
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,280
but we really want to know are their

330
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,890
managerial differences because we can

331
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,300
all by the same sets of technologies we

332
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,370
can try to hire people with the same

333
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,650
qualifications but it's actually hard to

334
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,890
do in practice but we can try to do that

335
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,870
but we know that firm a is probably

336
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,610
going to have or they're going to do

337
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,060
better they're going to suffer from pure

338
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:42,950
breaches fewer things that have to be

339
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:45,680
publicly disseminated versus firm B and

340
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,360
that usually we attribute to well

341
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,329
there's something going on in the man

342
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,399
men of the firm that's different so

343
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:54,380
that's really kind of what we're looking

344
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,810
at any advice we can give difference in

345
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,079
terms of hey you know you know this

346
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,670
practice will get you this this maybe

347
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,390
not so much so that's what we're really

348
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,130
trying to look at here and as I said

349
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,079
this is really early so we haven't been

350
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,459
able to answer all the questions yet but

351
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:16,370
you know in our initial kind of early

352
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:18,018
analysis we started that you will if

353
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,300
we're trying to get at that second

354
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,240
question now what do we need to start

355
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,120
looking at and in this first swipe at

356
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,089
this research the team and I we decided

357
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,540
okay you know we need to know who the

358
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,700
firm is and what they do because we want

359
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,319
to make sure that we can kind of you

360
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,040
know look at crosses they're an industry

361
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,470
specific affect things like this so we

362
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,649
captured the firm specific factors such

363
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,440
as number of employees because size is

364
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,970
relevant firm with 10 people just

365
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,910
operate a heck of a lot differently than

366
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,399
a firm with 10,000 people the industry

367
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,990
there in because obviously not only the

368
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,399
products and services that you deliver

369
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,160
but the regulation and compliance

370
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,010
requirement insurance healthcare

371
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,879
insurance providers have a whole set of

372
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,559
rules Financial Services has a whole set

373
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,480
of rules commercial banking has a whole

374
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,869
set of rules so we wanted to control for

375
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,760
that we also wanted to along with number

376
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,678
employees kind of get an idea of how big

377
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,309
they are in terms of assets so we looked

378
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,530
at the market capitalization and one

379
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,959
source and Hoover's were the places to

380
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,480
find that then we thought well who's

381
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,169
running the place and do people think

382
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,540
highly of them so we went to

383
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,130
glassdoor.com which is an interesting

384
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,510
site from a business research

385
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:45,200
perspective because you have firms and

386
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:47,809
you have people whose association with

387
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,840
the firm is not necessarily well

388
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:54,139
understood being able to provide ratings

389
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,110
of the firm so let's say I work for

390
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,000
company X I had an awesome time I did my

391
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,270
internship there in college and then

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,280
wait just time to move on in life and I

393
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,230
have very happy memories of firm X i'll

394
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
give it a great review and then there's

395
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:13,560
firm x that you know is the only offer i

396
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,240
got out of college and knows i had to

397
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,970
pay my student loan so i took the job

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,370
and you know i was just a number they

399
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,860
really kind of sucked and so yeah give

400
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,750
them a bad rating so there's no real

401
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,679
differentiating between current and

402
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,330
former rate or former employees and it's

403
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,910
not easy to tell if people were even an

404
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,860
employee so i could go to say a cable

405
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,200
provider who likes to be trashed in the

406
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,330
media and even though i'm just a

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,010
customer i can write nasty things and

408
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,120
that's something that's really well

409
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,980
known in terms of these review websites

410
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,959
or online review systems in general is

411
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,510
that you tend to only get the really

412
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,280
happy people or they're really cranky

413
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,980
people that are going to put things on

414
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,050
so but we thought well this actually

415
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,600
might serve our purpose because if the

416
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,190
firm is doing a great job we want to

417
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,350
know and if they're doing a horrible job

418
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,550
we want to know and if they're just kind

419
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,080
of like you're yeah you are the best uh

420
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,899
okay so that really kind of gives us

421
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,120
three clusters to work with so we

422
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,210
captured the CEO approval rating which

423
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,659
is a number it's a typical Likert scale

424
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,030
one to five where five is awesome one is

425
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:29,370
crappy that's not the word they use in

426
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,960
the label but you can pour and there's

427
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,479
also a number that captures senior

428
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,610
management approval and there's also an

429
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,500
overall firm rating now as you can

430
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,169
imagine these tend to trend together but

431
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,390
we do see some interesting differences

432
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,120
and again that's from glassdoor calm and

433
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,390
we also from some previous research knew

434
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,889
that firms that had IT executives in the

435
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:54,690
top six highest ranked executives tend

436
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,330
to do better in terms of information

437
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:01,710
security so we wanted to capture that

438
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:05,250
again for this data set so we wanted the

439
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,980
number of IT executives which at a lot

440
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:13,149
of firms is still zero that the CIO is

441
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:16,229
not even in the top six so but if

442
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:18,609
there were a firm that had a CIO and a

443
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:21,809
CISO chief information security officer

444
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:24,489
and maybe even a chief privacy officer

445
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,739
come in your top ranks we wanted to

446
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,450
capture that as well we want to make

447
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:30,489
sure that they were paid well or how

448
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,349
much were they paid because again we did

449
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:34,119
some previous research that says firms

450
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:36,249
do better when you pay your IT

451
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:38,228
executives better oh gosh you know

452
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:42,580
that's good news for all of us right

453
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:46,479
being an IT and also my research team is

454
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,728
half actually three fifths the female

455
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,679
and there is some interesting research

456
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:53,169
out of the finance literature that said

457
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,849
that female hedge fund managers actually

458
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:58,899
tend to get better returns over time

459
00:20:54,849 --> 00:21:01,779
because they are risk-averse rather than

460
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:04,330
risk seeking as a populate or a sample

461
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:06,460
not every female is risk averse not

462
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,559
every male is risk thinking obviously

463
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,200
but you know their thing you wouldn't do

464
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,809
you funny if you know where we see a lot

465
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,999
of female IT executives that firms maybe

466
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:19,509
do better in terms of managing their

467
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:21,940
risk and we'll get to that punch line

468
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:26,009
but that data is all available through

469
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:30,070
the execu cobb database that we have

470
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:32,440
here at Purdue we also wanted to know

471
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,080
how does the firm formally communicate

472
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,950
to regulators and shareholders and

473
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,589
stakeholders about risk so the risk

474
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,169
factors that firms disclose and they

475
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:45,999
don't have to disclose everything but

476
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,399
they can choose to disclose ones on

477
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:50,679
their 10k if they're a US based firm

478
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:54,449
door 20 up form that's filed with the

479
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,710
SEC if they're in an international firm

480
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,719
and of course I can only collect those

481
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,159
for publicly traded firms because of

482
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:02,109
your not publicly if you're not a public

483
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,979
firm you don't have to disclose that

484
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:09,249
information but we were able to identify

485
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:12,609
234 relevant risk factors from 34 of the

486
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:14,649
47 publicly named burned firms and so

487
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,099
you can start to see the conundrum as

488
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:22,089
researchers that we faced with the

489
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:24,279
anonymous capability of the model

490
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:26,259
because now we know there's firms out

491
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,680
there that participate but we can't

492
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,510
capture

493
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,210
data and we can't add it to our data set

494
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:35,530
so that's a bummer for us it's probably

495
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,000
you're not there for the firm's so IT

496
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,760
related risk factors would be things

497
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,950
like our data center is located near

498
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,850
major fault lines in California or

499
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,740
Washington state are due to the nature

500
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,649
of our business special like financial

501
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:55,450
services you know we're kind of a hacker

502
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:58,210
magnet things like that and then we

503
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,780
wanted to know what has been the

504
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,910
exposure at least the ones we know about

505
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,030
to information security incidents or

506
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,790
events so and again my colleagues like

507
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,500
to beat me up because and the other

508
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,960
information security researchers and

509
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,250
management because you know everybody

510
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,080
knows that there's a lot more breaches

511
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:22,060
than or ever reported but we can't read

512
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,570
people's mind so we can't get at that

513
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,460
data we use at data loss DB org which

514
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,460
has become a much richer source of data

515
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,200
with the various data loss notification

516
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,650
laws and I think we'll see some more

517
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,060
activity on that front and then

518
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,730
incidents that may not be a data loss

519
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,570
incident or may have been outside of a

520
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:46,840
jurisdiction that has this type of

521
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,850
compliant or regulatory requirement you

522
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,340
know things like they stole some

523
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:55,719
important patent application or they

524
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,720
stole our strategy documents so we use

525
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,910
LexisNexis to search for incidents such

526
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,570
as that and as you might imagine there

527
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:08,170
were a lot more data loss incidents in

528
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:09,639
rather than intellectual property loss

529
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,770
events but there are some in there and

530
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,390
we included them in the data set so

531
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,910
those are the things that we're looking

532
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,170
at currently and of course we probably

533
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,810
can collect even more data about

534
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,340
different aspects of the firm but those

535
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,990
are the ones are kind of what we call

536
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,120
low-hanging fruit from a research

537
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,190
perspective they're pretty easy to get

538
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,389
either screens gray being or getting

539
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:34,090
from a data source here at Purdue so the

540
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,950
first thing we looked at was the be sown

541
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,929
participating identified friends

542
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,330
themselves and we thought well you know

543
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,570
what are these firms like and

544
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,870
are they similar in their thinking are

545
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,490
they different so the first thing we did

546
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,928
is we actually took a lot of that data

547
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:54,929
that was numeric or ordinal and did some

548
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,730
basic regression analysis to see if

549
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,710
things were different and these firms

550
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,610
are remark I mean they kind of even

551
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,190
though they're in different industries

552
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,519
and there's some big differences between

553
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,380
these firms you are pretty similar or we

554
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,919
can say there were not many significant

555
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:14,019
differences so what we did is we went

556
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,510
back and say well do they kind of talk

557
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:19,960
the same way and in order to do that we

558
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:22,090
ran a cluster analysis on the text and

559
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,840
what happens in a cluster analysis on a

560
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,139
text it's similar to when you cluster

561
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:31,570
numeric data but we're looking for

562
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:33,850
phrases sentences that are similar they

563
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,149
don't have to use the exact language but

564
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:40,000
they're similar semantically so if I say

565
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:46,330
the Apple is red and someone else says

566
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,210
the Apple is Rouge those two things

567
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:52,480
being the same thing basically so what

568
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:56,730
happened was first of all we had

569
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,380
convergence meaning it found similar

570
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,760
categories of text among these risk

571
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,740
factors that were disclosed and we

572
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:09,940
experimentally varied this to find the

573
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:12,519
the best or the least mean squared error

574
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:16,750
and we came up with the optimal number

575
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:20,019
is five clusters and the and these are

576
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:24,130
just ID'd by the we use SAS text miner

577
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:29,019
for this and it just applied a ID really

578
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:31,090
the the biggest cluster the the number

579
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,980
of phrases that was the most across all

580
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:37,649
the firm's participating that we know

581
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:41,769
about is cluster number three which is

582
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:45,789
timely development market these are

583
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:47,860
companies that have some sort of product

584
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:51,010
or service that they're offering and

585
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,590
they actually the market concerns them

586
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,240
very much and so

587
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,658
we thought well that's interesting that

588
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:04,330
you know security is not their top one

589
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:07,179
but as we go further and software is in

590
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,350
that cluster the next biggest one is the

591
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:14,289
cluster ID number one which is breech

592
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,539
personal attack security so this is a

593
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:19,600
big concern and there really wasn't that

594
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:24,279
much difference in size between cluster

595
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:27,399
number three in cluster number one three

596
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:30,490
four and five were together much smaller

597
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:32,709
but they were also significant cluster

598
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,649
the next biggest cluster was cluster

599
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:40,299
five which was intellectual property and

600
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:43,059
copyright and infringement so companies

601
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:44,950
are not only protecting their data but

602
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,070
they know it goes beyond that we have to

603
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,470
protect everything that makes our firm

604
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:54,700
valuable which is usually I mean value

605
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,529
data is important but if you can't come

606
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,350
up with the next iteration of your

607
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:02,380
product if you can't bring that drug to

608
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,178
market you're not going to exist as a

609
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,640
company much longer or at least not as a

610
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:07,870
very successful one so we thought well

611
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,029
that's pretty cool and that kind of

612
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:13,989
dovetails nicely with some previous work

613
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:15,820
and then cluster for is the fourth

614
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,010
largest and that is your natural

615
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:22,360
disasters your floods your interruptions

616
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:23,890
and then finally cluster 2 is we thought

617
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,439
this was kind of interesting that popped

618
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,919
up is the risk involved with using other

619
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,260
people's software as part of your own

620
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,850
products and services for example you

621
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:39,850
use an open source product let's say you

622
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:41,980
licensed MySQL for something okay if

623
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,230
it's a huge vulnerability is found in

624
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,919
that software that can impact your

625
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,600
operations and there's a lot of great

626
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,669
open source software that firms find

627
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,520
very attractive to use or it could be

628
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:57,450
that we have this software bended and if

629
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,649
our vendor goes belly-up or it turns out

630
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,120
there's things full of holes that we

631
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:04,750
didn't detect they can be in a lot of

632
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,810
trouble because the end customer can't

633
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,400
differentiate what

634
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,750
Microsoft's product versus something

635
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,850
they might have included as a third

636
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:18,070
party so like I don't care obviously you

637
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,679
can spend it all you want but the

638
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,860
customer is going to associate the brand

639
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,590
with the problem as opposed to a third

640
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:31,990
party so we thought okay that's a good

641
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,820
start then we want to see where the farm

642
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:37,480
is focusing in terms of those risk

643
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:41,850
factors the visa model includes 12 must

644
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,980
do activities and these are listed but

645
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,340
identify the gate locations gathering

646
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,890
the necessary or defector information

647
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,139
privacy culture of security which means

648
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,120
you provide awareness training create

649
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,490
your data classification scheme and your

650
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,679
inventory build and publish your

651
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:04,110
features security features create your

652
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,880
standards perform your future reviews

653
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:09,100
use automated tools along with manual

654
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,680
tools drive test with requirements and

655
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,810
features external penetration tests

656
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,530
these are things that most people know

657
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,120
that they should be doing but not all do

658
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,270
ensure that the basics are in place for

659
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,040
host and network security and then

660
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,170
identify the bugs during operations and

661
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,480
beat them back to development and that

662
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:31,420
is a big problem for a lot of firms

663
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,880
today but these are what the BCM firms

664
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,920
identifies kind of must do and so we

665
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,870
wanted to see okay are they practicing

666
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,970
what they preach or they preaching what

667
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,010
they practice and that's kind of a

668
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,930
chicken and egg question but we decided

669
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,060
well let's look at what they say in

670
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,930
their communications or risk disclosures

671
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:51,429
and you know once we we thought it was a

672
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,260
good idea at first and then we kind of

673
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:58,020
went back and said well maybe not and

674
00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:00,430
the results kind of reinforced that that

675
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,900
what when we look at those beasts and

676
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,780
must do activities they're pretty

677
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,370
operational in nature and the risk

678
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,310
disclosures are meant to be more

679
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:11,770
strategic in nature so we kind of look

680
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:14,889
at the continuum from the strategic to

681
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,810
the operational these are really

682
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:20,890
capturing more the operational although

683
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:23,399
we do see so we see the

684
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:26,770
first must do activity which is

685
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,620
established those SSTL gates we find

686
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,020
that the number of firms participating

687
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,360
and this is data from besom not from me

688
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:39,670
is about eighty-five percent but when we

689
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,469
searched through the or basically we ran

690
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,110
another analysis using text miner

691
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,300
looking for any associations we don't

692
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,310
find anything in the risk disclosures

693
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,290
but you think well firms probably

694
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,000
wouldn't say anything that specific and

695
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,190
their risk disclosure so we're actually

696
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,050
collecting a whole nother set of data to

697
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,450
see if we can rerun this analysis on

698
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,090
something that's a little bit more

699
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,740
operational in nature but as we go down

700
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,350
we do actually see some what we would

701
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,710
call pretty good alignment privacy is an

702
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,419
important topic because you know firms

703
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,840
generally want to do the right things

704
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,480
when it comes to managing or engaging

705
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,490
with their customers and clients and we

706
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,380
do see that they're talking they're

707
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,510
saying they're participating at

708
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,970
seventy-eight percent and they do say

709
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,460
that into a small extent about 13%

710
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:30,070
within their risk factor disclosures as

711
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,900
we go down promoting a security culture

712
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,060
I thought that was interesting that that

713
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,370
even popped up because I thought are

714
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,490
they going to really talk about that but

715
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:42,310
they do seventy-five percent say they of

716
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:45,010
the besom firm say they do it in the

717
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:48,250
besom literature but twenty-seven

718
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,600
percent say they do in their risk factor

719
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,670
disclosures which actually thought was

720
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,419
pretty pretty interesting it's even

721
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,430
mentioned they're prioritizing that

722
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,700
actually picked up twenty-nine percent

723
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:03,220
in the risk factors versus sixty-four

724
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,350
percent saying actually do you practice

725
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,530
that creating proactive security

726
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,209
guidance thirty percent refer to it in

727
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,370
some way they don't use those exact

728
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,190
words but close enough semantically

729
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,199
versus any one percent say they do that

730
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,180
meet the demand for security features

731
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,330
and creating standards forty percent

732
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,990
disclose that in their formal risk

733
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:29,439
communications we thought that was

734
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:31,030
pretty cool and so you know they kind of

735
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,940
are practicing what we preach we

736
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:38,769
actually need a better data set to

737
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,929
to reinforce that so then we started

738
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,600
looking back at the numeric data and the

739
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:46,330
ordinal data and we did want to look as

740
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,070
I mentioned before we didn't see all

741
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:52,570
that much difference but my research

742
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,649
assistants really were curious about

743
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:59,200
this gender question and so we figured

744
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:04,090
well if there's more females on the IT

745
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,409
you know in the top group and more than

746
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,939
were female they should be less

747
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:10,659
risk-averse meaning they should have

748
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,690
reduced risk exposure and fewer security

749
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,760
breaches well it turns out that the

750
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,940
relationship wasn't quite significant in

751
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,159
the data but we do see the right

752
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,139
relationship so if we collect more data

753
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,409
we actually should be able to get

754
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:28,389
significant we should see significant

755
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,909
results but then take me to the bank on

756
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,829
that one of the problems was we don't

757
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:37,300
have any female executives in the sample

758
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:38,649
most firms had zero although Aetna not

759
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,929
surprising being a healthcare related

760
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:43,569
insurance firm did have forty-two

761
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,099
percent of top executives being female

762
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:48,668
top I'd keep that could it's being

763
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:50,829
female not surprising the bigger you are

764
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:53,230
just the more target you are so number

765
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:57,190
of employees was positively correlated

766
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,540
but we had a lot of multicollinearity in

767
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,920
the data which means we've got to kind

768
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:04,619
of do some feature selection to get the

769
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,900
the statistics actually make more sense

770
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,400
and we did find that again the

771
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,690
relationship was going in the right way

772
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,849
but the better people write you on

773
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,339
glassdoor the fewer number of reach

774
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:17,500
reports that were collected from the

775
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:19,869
media sources so again not significant

776
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,060
but you know that actually hang a better

777
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:25,920
run firm is going to be better run in

778
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:28,779
multiple dimensions not just the

779
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,460
security or not just you know how many

780
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,480
parties you throw for your employees so

781
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,119
that's good so the firm's themselves are

782
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,589
fairly consistent manager Lee from what

783
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,780
we can find and that kind of leads us to

784
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,040
you know these firms generally speaking

785
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,860
are going to have an overall higher

786
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,290
quality of management man

787
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,970
people and procedures and processes in

788
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,190
place so what we're currently doing

789
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:58,669
because I said this was really early is

790
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,070
we've collected a matched set so we now

791
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,530
have the set of firms that we don't have

792
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,810
any indication now that does again from

793
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,460
a statistics point of view it's a little

794
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,340
rough because they could be

795
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,790
participating in BCM and we just can't

796
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:16,190
find any public trace of it but we've

797
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,140
come up with a matched set so for each

798
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:22,130
be sunburned we've collected three to

799
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:24,740
five kind of control firms if you will

800
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,060
and we're starting to do the statistics

801
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,770
to see what the real differences are and

802
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,960
we already we don't have the gender one

803
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,630
but we already know that the glass door

804
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,810
ratings aren't quite as high on these

805
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:41,330
number of breaches it looks actually

806
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,920
there's fewer breaches but the types are

807
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,370
a little bit more concerning in the

808
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,780
number of records laws so so that's kind

809
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:55,160
of where we are oh and I'm early but we

810
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,680
would really like to well we're keep

811
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:09,920
going on that but any questions that you

812
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:12,029
may have yes so these are given IP

813
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,710
services ever do

814
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:18,130
this will be not for mature so you know

815
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,290
by the pc model good luck yeah but if

816
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,050
you were to look at we shall meet on one

817
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,270
side have you also looked at companies

818
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,970
that have the skin dreds akin to them in

819
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,850
terms of IT security for example who

820
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:34,569
were the ones who designed visa or make

821
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:38,259
a fake you know Google for example which

822
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:40,690
has a big security interest by the Sun I

823
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:45,460
mean it means the portion so for

824
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:48,070
security then the VC water might not

825
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,830
even apply right so that's a great

826
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:54,220
question about being able to offload

827
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,140
risk or firms that we know Google used

828
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,390
to protect their not listed currently

829
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:02,859
but we kind of took them out because

830
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:06,490
it's google no no that's that's a good

831
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,260
example the IT outsourcing question is a

832
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,509
very interesting one what we're seeing

833
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,350
actually and that's kind of a tricky one

834
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:15,550
for us because it's a really dynamic

835
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:19,930
environment we're seeing a lot of firms

836
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:23,560
in sourcing again and so I've got some

837
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,990
colleagues at UIUC in michigan state

838
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,210
that actually look at contracts

839
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:30,310
contracts and in sourcing outsourcing so

840
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,230
i might ping them and see what their

841
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,820
perspective is but we we're seeing that

842
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:38,980
a lot of this stuff's very fluid right

843
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:42,880
now so it's kind of hard to make any

844
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,770
useful statements one thing in the risk

845
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,760
factors that they disclose they disclose

846
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:52,350
when things are not specific systems or

847
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,780
processes but they talk a lot about

848
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:58,839
third-party vendors which we can kind of

849
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,910
take to be outsourcing firms for at

850
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,160
least some of them and and they're very

851
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:07,960
concerned about that because you can't

852
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:10,180
completely outsource your risk because I

853
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,930
still have you know if it's my product

854
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:17,200
that has you know a module that someone

855
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:20,410
else designed in it and it's bad I still

856
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,990
get sued so but that I think is an

857
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,890
interesting and a deeper perspective to

858
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,149
take thank you

859
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:33,269
if you ask questions make sure you use

860
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:38,339
the microphone freeze any other

861
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:43,950
questions yes as you look at

862
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:46,910
management's decisions in terms of this

863
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:49,589
is what we get this is what it costs us

864
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:51,930
is there anything that you crank in

865
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:53,849
there in terms of risk so it is possible

866
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,180
that you overspend on something it has a

867
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:58,230
highly unlikely possibility of happening

868
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,348
to the detriment of other things that

869
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:04,319
are more likely to happen that's kind of

870
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:08,130
the golden ring really because we know

871
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:11,400
that unless you're mcafee or a security

872
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:13,710
company every dollar that you spend on

873
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:19,650
security may be a dollar that you can't

874
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:23,880
spend on rd or compensation or market

875
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:26,400
development so it is a really tough

876
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,150
position for companies to figure out

877
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,910
what is that best balance and research

878
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,910
wise I think you're seeing people ask

879
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,739
the question but the only answers we've

880
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,828
gotten have been from game theory models

881
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:43,999
which we all know are so abstract they

882
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:46,349
don't really apply that much to reality

883
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:49,019
there's been some work out of Maryland

884
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:52,140
where which is really kind of what we

885
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:55,348
all side all the time where you know

886
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:59,549
there is what they call kind of a

887
00:40:55,349 --> 00:41:01,470
classic smoke stack where you do have to

888
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:03,230
look at the marginal benefit versus the

889
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:07,109
marginal cost of every dollar invested

890
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:09,809
beyond what would bankrupt your company

891
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:11,308
so beyond the catastrophic but it's not

892
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:14,009
becoming you know I think the

893
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:17,400
catastrophic and the not catastrophic is

894
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:19,980
not clearly demarcated because something

895
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,910
that seems little we've seen really

896
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:27,809
snowball so I think in practice figuring

897
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:30,538
out what what is what can be very murky

898
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:32,569
at best but yeah that's that's something

899
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:35,369
that we're really really curious about

900
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:38,250
do you invest up to a level three or

901
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:40,230
maybe even beyond what does that got you

902
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,440
does that get you the ability to sleep

903
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,540
at night or does it take so much

904
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,510
resource away from other vital functions

905
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,000
of the firm that you go into the death

906
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,510
spiral so that's that's what we're all

907
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,400
interested in to a great question jump

908
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:03,960
yeah you are identify some of the yet

909
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:06,720
Detroit's a has been looked at tenure of

910
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:11,820
security employees and get that makes

911
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:14,370
the thing I'm making I'm making huge

912
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,560
assumptions here but I mean if you have

913
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,799
constant journal or even your painting

914
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,230
well maybe people leave other reason has

915
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,160
that been looked at in the research yes

916
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:29,550
actually two of my former PhD students

917
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:35,430
and I looked at that very question and

918
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:38,640
we found that there's kind of a golden

919
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:40,950
area if the turnover is really high

920
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,290
that's not good because nobody's paying

921
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,509
it there's a learning curve with all of

922
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,310
these things and you just you can't get

923
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:51,780
acclimated enough to make some decisions

924
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:55,920
that stick if you stay too long that's

925
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,870
usually not a really good fun either we

926
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,640
didn't we didn't have enough data

927
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,880
because there weren't enough IT

928
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:06,569
executives in our samples and we took we

929
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,320
had a pretty good size sample to really

930
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:13,470
tell what that old ideal tenure is but

931
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:17,310
we know that if it's less than I think

932
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:19,709
18 months that's not good i I'll have to

933
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,680
look back at the paper but you know be

934
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,800
kind of the usual rules of thumb applied

935
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:31,640
after five to seven years people kind of

936
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:35,400
get stale yeah but we did we looked at

937
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,160
yeah we just found so few firms had IT

938
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,460
executives in those top six we were

939
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,060
shocked because we thought we'd find

940
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:48,300
CIOs and CIS OS and chief privacy

941
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,250
officer zwi thought we'd have all this

942
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,270
data to look with and we went through

943
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,920
every

944
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:57,220
for us-based firms because we're also

945
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,660
looking at compensation they'd had to be

946
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,410
publicly available so we could get the

947
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:07,210
compensation data and we were sorely

948
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:11,649
disappointed by what we found or what we

949
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:14,920
couldn't find of those firms that did

950
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:19,000
have the information officer or a

951
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,310
security officer in the top six were you

952
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,500
does this look like this is a trend that

953
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,540
is increasing or or just look if it's

954
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,120
been a constant that either do here

955
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,009
you're done we didn't have time series

956
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:34,710
data so we couldn't look at changes over

957
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:40,300
time we took snapshots and we know that

958
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:43,630
just tracking the media that these we

959
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:47,830
are seeing more at the first PlayStation

960
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:54,520
hacked Sony didn't have a CIO and I'm

961
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:56,370
not sure that age there but yeah so yeah

962
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,750
that's just one firm but and they

963
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,100
actually weren't in our data's that we

964
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,850
just kind of looked at that on the side

965
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:07,060
but yeah we there's a lot more interest

966
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:12,520
and I think the law regulation is kind

967
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:14,440
of pushing this to firms attention at

968
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,860
greater levels and in the past we

969
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,250
thought tjmaxx with it then its target

970
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:27,670
was it home depot going on but it's it's

971
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:30,190
getting there it's improving we also

972
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,020
consider the mergers and acquisitions

973
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,360
and other research going to be different

974
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,840
say there was an example of say some

975
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,640
some of these financial light and saline

976
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,100
voltage which was taken over by MF

977
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,950
Global and then they robbed the

978
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,690
individual icons and then maybe they pay

979
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,180
it back on and you can do you consider

980
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,480
do a yes or no we don't consider that

981
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:55,720
but that's something that because we

982
00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:00,120
didn't do we weren't trying to nail down

983
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:03,730
a specific change at one point of time

984
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,810
but that's like outsourcing or trying

985
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,580
doubts or service that's

986
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,520
thing that we need to take into

987
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,799
consideration because that could you

988
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,200
acquire a firmer you emerge because you

989
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,310
think there's some value to be gained

990
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,640
that's going to outweigh the cost of the

991
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:20,590
transactions but it's you know really

992
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,440
good question how does that change your

993
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,870
security posture and that's something

994
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:34,060
we'll have to look at that's a great

995
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:35,259
observation thanks have you have you

996
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,779
observed some kind of correlation

997
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,500
between companies moving their data and

998
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,360
competition to the cloud and a higher

999
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,820
risk factor that they have or is it

1000
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,780
something that you observe in there

1001
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,430
observe that they put in their

1002
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,760
disclaimers just like the question about

1003
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:53,319
having vendors and then so it's cloud a

1004
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,900
factor that that is something that I

1005
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,340
looked at or quarterly we didn't find it

1006
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,520
but I think it's because we weren't

1007
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,080
looking in the right place when we start

1008
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,020
looking at the more operational

1009
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,610
information coming from firms that might

1010
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,980
be something we pick up that some people

1011
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,810
very interested in that topic though

1012
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:16,120
because you know that's kind of a big

1013
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:20,049
question right now good tan gentle but

1014
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,600
very useful thank you yeah you mentioned

1015
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:25,030
earlier like target and home depot know

1016
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,670
the these companies that have issues

1017
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:31,180
have you done any look at to see whether

1018
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,600
other companies are reevaluating their

1019
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,040
processes when something bad happens to

1020
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,870
someone else is that part of this

1021
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,880
researcher it's not part of this

1022
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,310
research but we know that that happens

1023
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,200
we talked to our friends in the

1024
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,120
consulting world may help companies do

1025
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:52,960
that so yeah business for them is really

1026
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:56,650
good great quick yeah I mean I think

1027
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,690
that's you know pretty you know we got a

1028
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:02,950
group of is researchers that look and

1029
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:05,080
they call it fad in IT so it's like when

1030
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,419
SI p you know are three first became a

1031
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,520
real big thing you know firms were just

1032
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,160
all jumping or bandwagon effect you know

1033
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,490
oh I gotta have SI p why well because

1034
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,549
that guy's got SI p and we saw firms

1035
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,100
bankrupt it by trying to an aside

1036
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:22,170
p it's you know it's just the nature of

1037
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,360
the beast we saw firms fail because of

1038
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,670
an ERP implementation gone bad it just

1039
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,000
sucks so many resources in the firm

1040
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,650
couldn't survive so there's negative

1041
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,180
bandwagon effects and there's positive

1042
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,120
bandwagon effect so this would be an

1043
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:39,270
example where yeah I'm sure firms are oh

1044
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,779
my gosh you know could that happen to us

1045
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:44,400
and could be so yeah plus there's things

1046
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,760
like PCI compliance you know the

1047
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,770
regulators and auditors are going to get

1048
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:57,900
feisty and you know look more closely

1049
00:48:49,770 --> 00:49:01,860
which is a positive thing okay anything

1050
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,390
else well I really appreciate all your

1051
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,790
feedback really useful I'm going to take

1052
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,810
that back to the team and keep going so

1053
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,810
thanks a lot everybody
