1
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,770
good afternoon and welcome to this

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,509
seminar today I know all of you or most

3
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,820
of you I think I'm Melissa dark i'm a

4
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,340
professor and computer and information

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,620
technology and it's my honor to

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,400
introduce dr. laura able from the

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,860
University at Buffalo Sunni who is the

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,830
guest speaker today so I wanted to let

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,650
you know i first met laura this past

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,170
summer through a program called jen

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,559
cyber which is a national initiative in

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,239
order to try to increase the number of

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,750
high school and middle school students

14
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,760
interested in studying cyber security we

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,149
have a pretty significant pipeline

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,780
problem in the United States we need to

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:12,240
hire a lot of people in the workforce

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,030
colleges and universities are producing

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,000
the number of students that are coming

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,550
to them but there aren't enough coming

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,410
to them to study cyber security so Jen

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,380
cyber aims to address that challenge

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,939
that problem to increase the number of

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,420
students in high schools and middle

25
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,270
schools and it does so through a number

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,670
of different camps so one of the camps

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,509
this summer was at the University at

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,210
Buffalo Sunni and my role is to evaluate

29
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,119
the entire gen cyber program and the

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,309
effectiveness of it and so I'm an

31
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,799
external evaluator to all of the camps

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,310
and Laura worked on a very interesting

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,950
internal evaluation project at her

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,750
particular camp and so she's going to

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,570
share with you what she learned about

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,030
gender differences in cybersecurity

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,460
engagement and self-efficacy thank you

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,460
you're welcome thank you so much melissa

39
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,190
so hello thank you and I've had a great

40
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:17,190
time here at Purdue and I really

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,630
appreciate all the support and all the

42
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,700
interest that everyone has shown me for

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,709
the things that I've been talking about

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:28,260
so as mosa noted at suny we ran our own

45
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,690
gen cyber camp and I was sort of drawn

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,290
into the project because I know a little

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,359
bit about assessment and I'm it

48
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,480
from outside of the field of

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,450
cybersecurity to that point though my

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,849
husband is in information security so I

51
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,858
have a little bit of knowledge and I was

52
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,560
able to bounce some ideas off of him and

53
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:49,299
he gave me some input and the running

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,879
joke around the house now is that I'm

55
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:55,180
his boss because I know a little bit

56
00:02:51,879 --> 00:03:00,488
about I know a lot about this now but a

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:03,340
tad bit more about cybersecurity so my

58
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,180
experience in this project was really

59
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,639
sort of as Melissa noted to fold so I

60
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,590
ran a camp but at the same time I really

61
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,959
wanted to see if our camp was effective

62
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,870
and in order to do that we have to be

63
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,569
able to measure it and before we measure

64
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,239
anything we really have to be able to

65
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:25,540
define what it is we're measuring to be

66
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,780
able to then operationalize and be able

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,578
to explain you know that the instruments

68
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,540
that we're using our in fact measuring

69
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,540
the things that we're saying we're

70
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,909
measuring and so when I was drawn into

71
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,379
the project that's one of the reasons I

72
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,060
said we need an assessment piece of

73
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,459
writing this grant you know we know that

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,220
you know a bit about assessment so when

75
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,329
I came into the meeting I asked them you

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,989
know well I need to know what

77
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,889
cybersecurity is can you tell me and

78
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,389
everybody goes kind of looking around

79
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,209
the room like wow thats you know really

80
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,329
great question and so one of the first

81
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,709
sort of initiatives for us at university

82
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,400
of buffalo and sort of the gen cyber

83
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:06,040
program initiative overall is to really

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,790
identify what the principal components

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,060
of cybersecurity knowledge are and so

86
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,909
what I decided to do was start from

87
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,099
scratch and I think being in outsider

88
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:21,579
from the field was a really good

89
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:25,030
actually tool for me because I don't

90
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,220
know much about it and in order to be

91
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,679
able to explain it to students I think

92
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,599
that's an important say i stated i was

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,729
almost at the level of the student so I

94
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,620
needed to know what it is the things

95
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,909
that they needed to know and it sort of

96
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,029
be brought on board and in that regard

97
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:45,200
so as we know cybersecurity is

98
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,800
definitely in an area that we need to

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,520
we need to build up in addition to

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,350
having a very leaky pipeline will say

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,080
and when I say leaky pipeline I mean

102
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,150
that we're not necessarily putting

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,010
enough people into that pipeline but

104
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,719
also a lot of times what's happening is

105
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,599
that pipeline is leaking so people will

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,240
maybe express interest in it but they

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,940
will drop out so if they even go into a

108
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,220
certain degree program or start taking a

109
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,230
course it may be that they don't take a

110
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,140
subsequent course or that they drop out

111
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,680
and in addition to that leaky pipeline

112
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,930
there's a specific deficiency in the

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,660
representation of women in the cyber

114
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,250
workforce so less than thirty percent of

115
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,330
the u.s. cyber workforce and this is as

116
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,130
of 2013 is female and less than twenty

117
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,640
percent of the the cyber workforce in

118
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,770
the UK is female and unfortunately what

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,710
we're seeing between there's some

120
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,750
national the national center for

121
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,270
educational statistics keeps track of

122
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,390
the number of people that are enrolled

123
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,580
in different programs in colleges so

124
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,130
we're able to sort of look at trends in

125
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,140
different types of academic domains and

126
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,250
they'll keep track of those demographics

127
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,770
by gender race ethnicity SES so

128
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,020
socioeconomic status and so you're able

129
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,250
to then see by comparing that those that

130
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,320
cross-sectional data it's not

131
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,880
necessarily tracking the students but by

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,800
comparing the percentage of student

133
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:20,300
females that are in cyber intended

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,370
careers in 2004 with 2008 with 2012 we

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,020
see that actually the the percentage of

136
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,590
females that are pursuing those types of

137
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:32,180
degrees is is decreasing so that says to

138
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,250
me that we really need to not only start

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,500
to attract more females into this field

140
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,320
but encourage them support them show

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,170
them the this these types of role models

142
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,170
exist and to really encourage that type

143
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,480
of environment in order to do that a lot

144
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,150
of times we need to create early

145
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,050
experiences so many of us knew what we

146
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,750
wanted to do because we had exposure to

147
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,639
you know a certain field early on and a

148
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,349
lot of times the courses that you take

149
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,409
in high school are going to predict what

150
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:05,060
you take in college and a lot of times

151
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:07,460
the courses that you take in high school

152
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,650
are going to be molded by your

153
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,400
experiences and your success in high

154
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:15,469
school but also before that so my IX I

155
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,729
did a guest lecture in a course

156
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,560
yesterday where I asked how many

157
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,240
students had taken a computer science

158
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,529
course in high school and the majority

159
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,749
of people who raised their hands and I

160
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:27,490
asked how many have taken one in middle

161
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:30,349
school or elementary school no one right

162
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,889
unless you're not from the US probably

163
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,779
so that's problematic and it's something

164
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,439
that we need to address and so the gent

165
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:41,360
I / initiative is not only to increase

166
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,090
the the workforce but to also increase

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,689
the diversity of the cyber workforce and

168
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,638
doing so early early enough on in the

169
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,409
pipeline so that students are

170
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,650
experiencing success and they're having

171
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:56,719
success and fun enjoying it and at a

172
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,998
very early age so that they are able to

173
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,129
pursue the different types of courses

174
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:02,810
and structure their experiences in the

175
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,729
forthcoming years and what we really

176
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,909
call an education the formative years in

177
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:10,758
order to to be able to equip themselves

178
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,710
with the skills that they'll need to to

179
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,399
succeed in not only in college but

180
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,409
beyond so obviously diversity in the in

181
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,930
the cyber workforces is a major

182
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,569
initiative and as we see with a lot of

183
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,509
stem discipline so science technology

184
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,219
engineering and mathematics those early

185
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,649
experiences are really important for

186
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,360
realizing that that type of diversity

187
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:37,610
and encouraging that those types of

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:40,760
successes in relation to gender

189
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,339
disparities in cyber security a lot of

190
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,500
the research that's been done in stem

191
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:49,160
and the other stem areas that has

192
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,160
received a lot of you know a claim has

193
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,850
been in science and in mathematics and

194
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,769
we know we assess that a lot because it

195
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,440
was you know part of some of the major

196
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:04,160
initiative behind a lot of the National

197
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,329
Assessments so because we rely a lot on

198
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,589
the mathematics and the science

199
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,670
components for some of the National

200
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,769
Assessments and international

201
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,630
assessments we focus a lot of our

202
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,380
attention on those gender differences

203
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,310
and

204
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:20,390
diversity there in and we know from that

205
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:23,829
body of research that females tend to

206
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,689
feel less significantly less competent

207
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,660
regardless of achievement or past

208
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:34,250
experiences or competency in STEM

209
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,350
related disciplines so if I myself and a

210
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,720
male counterpart everything else being

211
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,520
equal have the same achievement we've

212
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,530
had the same experiences if we were to

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,120
gauge the self-efficacy or the extent to

214
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,089
which i think i can be successful in

215
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,800
that career again controlling for all

216
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,140
other differences males are

217
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,729
significantly more likely to say yes i'm

218
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,880
going to be able to succeed i'm

219
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,220
confident i think i can do this and that

220
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,980
notion of self-efficacy is very

221
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,020
intricately woven with achievement and

222
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,710
we know achievement is intricately

223
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,670
related to pursuit career pursuit and

224
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:16,220
retention in an academic domain so this

225
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,740
self-efficacy component is something

226
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,280
that's really integral to closing what

227
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,930
I'm calling the the cyber gender gap and

228
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,880
because if you're able to it's not to

229
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,589
say that if you just raise somebody's

230
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,670
self-efficacy and keep telling them that

231
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,020
they're really great that all of a

232
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,870
sudden they're going to just become this

233
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:36,189
cyber butterfly that's not necessarily

234
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,750
what I'm saying but it does help to

235
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,490
create those experiences in which they

236
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,820
can build up their self-efficacy and

237
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,000
that does tend to be related to

238
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,920
achievement and pursuit so again in a

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,800
lot of other STEM disciplines

240
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,959
engineering mathematics science and

241
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,430
technology a lot of times males tend to

242
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,490
rate themselves higher in terms of

243
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,739
competency or in state that they're more

244
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,700
efficacious in those particular domains

245
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,470
and again as in other STEM disciplines

246
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,440
these differences in confidence and self

247
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,720
efficacy and something that I refer to

248
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,520
as engagement which is sort of the

249
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,740
enjoyment of certain tasks or the

250
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,079
enjoyment that you if you ever get lost

251
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,940
in sort of the field that you're in you

252
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,670
know that you're you know engaged in it

253
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,280
and you know can kind of you know lose

254
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,099
yourself in it in a good way I mean

255
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,740
those are all things

256
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,100
are related to again academic pursuit

257
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,190
and in your career path so again as I

258
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,370
had stated these sort of that

259
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,600
backgrounds there is that you know

260
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,329
self-efficacy and engagement are really

261
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,759
important things to study and because of

262
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,649
the the model that we've got I have you

263
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,720
know showing right here that the early

264
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,250
experience in success and social support

265
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,350
and modeling those being sort of the

266
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,509
front loaders to cybersecurity

267
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,889
engagement and self-efficacy because

268
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:01,110
these things in the middle are the

269
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,839
things that are going to relate to your

270
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,589
cybersecurity course taking your career

271
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,180
retention and to your pursuit and so the

272
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,089
things that I really in this model

273
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,388
focused on are those engagement and

274
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,980
self-efficacy and again when I city sat

275
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,690
down with my colleagues and ask them

276
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,509
well what is it that we're trying to do

277
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,300
at this camp so at our gen cyber camp we

278
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:27,630
wanted to create an experience for about

279
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:32,310
35 students simply because of resources

280
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:35,069
and our students were ages 13 to 17 and

281
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:40,109
didn't have much background in cyber

282
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:42,719
anything and they had self-elected apply

283
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,000
to the program and what we had intended

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
to do was over the course of the week

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,630
have them build websites and interweave

286
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
all these different types of lessons and

287
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,000
concepts through those website designs

288
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,769
and at the end of the week what we ended

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
up doing was we had the students

290
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,600
incorporate their websites so to create

291
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,370
a customer-facing website and then take

292
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,380
them into sort of what we could call the

293
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,060
simulation they didn't know it at the

294
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,860
time we just brought them into a room

295
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,630
that they thought was really cool and we

296
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,889
had them sit in their teams and go

297
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,800
through these steps you know you add a

298
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:15,480
user enable these privileges that type

299
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,990
of thing once they got to a certain step

300
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,149
we had a sort of had a red team but we

301
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,279
called it the rosette team because it

302
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,529
wasn't a really hardcore red team it was

303
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,240
a I first called it the pink team but

304
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,910
the males didn't really appreciate that

305
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,069
so I said okay rosette made me so the

306
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,829
rosette team then came in and two faced

307
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:37,139
the website and the reason that we did

308
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,638
that was because at first we were kind

309
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,019
of thinking of different vignettes and

310
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,100
different ways

311
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:47,239
to try and hone in the message that you

312
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,920
know cyber attacks are personal okay and

313
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:52,410
the way that we thought that best was

314
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,139
achieved was by attacking their personal

315
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,868
material right so these lessons became

316
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,459
really real to them and they were as

317
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:03,089
soon as they were to face all their work

318
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,339
was you know destroyed and you know of

319
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,720
course we had Illustrated throughout the

320
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,509
entire week that it was really important

321
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,689
for them to create backups and that type

322
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:15,989
of thing so and it was a lesson for them

323
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:18,349
in you know applying all the lessons

324
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,670
that we had learned but also in

325
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,790
realizing you know that they can take

326
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:27,809
certain steps to establish security and

327
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,089
make a more secure environment but

328
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,219
throughout that entire week the before

329
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:33,569
we you know obviously expose them to

330
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
that that's the thing that I wanted to

331
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:37,799
ask my colleagues was is it really

332
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,410
achievement that we're trying to make a

333
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,519
difference in you know and if so then we

334
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,649
need to create an assessment that's

335
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,059
going to identify what the learning

336
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,499
objectives are what the achievement is

337
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:52,230
and we had some models and it was really

338
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:53,970
a lot of the undergrad program in a

339
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,829
cyber security class that was watered

340
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,079
down and I said you know what I think we

341
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,729
should do I think we should look at how

342
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,199
they're enjoying themselves you know if

343
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,299
that's something that we're increasing

344
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,599
because that as I show in the model is

345
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,220
one of the first steps right in order to

346
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,970
learn something you have to like what

347
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,069
you're learning you have to be

348
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,649
interested in it you have to be engaged

349
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,899
in it and so I was really sort of

350
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,639
adamant about maybe it's taking a step

351
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,769
back away from achievement and measuring

352
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,079
the growth in that and looking more at

353
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:25,139
some of the precursors to achievement so

354
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,699
engagement and self-efficacy and my

355
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,819
background is in educational psychology

356
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,410
so self efficacy is something that I'm

357
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:34,699
actually really interested in and

358
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:40,199
engagement so cyber security engagement

359
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:41,878
is something that I been termed in sort

360
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,219
of the literature as enjoyment and

361
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,629
intended pursuit so if you're engaged in

362
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,699
something again sort of what I stated

363
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:50,519
before is you're happy you like learning

364
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,410
about it it's something that you know

365
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,089
you're excited to go to class you like

366
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,149
talking your friends about it thats hype

367
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:59,610
thing and self-efficacy has a couple

368
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,410
different components so self-efficacy is

369
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,839
something that we we study a lot in

370
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,059
education because it again is very

371
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,850
strongly related to achievement and it's

372
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:12,839
really broadly defined as your general

373
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,480
sense of being able to do something even

374
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,269
in the face of many challenges so it's

375
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,629
sort of tied into persistence and tied

376
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:24,059
into the notion that even with all of

377
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,220
these obstacles I'm still going to be

378
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,660
able to achieve all right so it is

379
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,569
moderated by a lot of different things

380
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,219
but that in and of itself if you have a

381
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:35,759
high self-efficacy for something you're

382
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,370
more likely to succeed in it so again

383
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,769
this is sort of where I relied on the

384
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,079
expertise of my colleagues to tell me

385
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:46,230
well what is in order to feel that

386
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,609
you're good in cyber security what are

387
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,230
the things that you need to be able to

388
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,449
do okay what are the things that you

389
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,059
need the domains the broad sort of

390
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,609
domains and again having no knowledge in

391
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,309
these types of things I just really sat

392
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,110
down with four experts and had

393
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,579
conversations with them and then sort of

394
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,589
mapped out some of the things that they

395
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,539
had said and then presented the results

396
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,928
back to them sort of the rudimentary

397
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,429
results and said you know are these the

398
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,620
types of things was again sort of an

399
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:17,100
iterative process but some of the things

400
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,958
that came up in those conversations were

401
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,299
problem solving and general computer

402
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,819
self-efficacy so the extent to which you

403
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:26,220
are feel that you're able to solve

404
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,750
problems and how if you feel comfortable

405
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,669
on a computer if you're able to

406
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,090
troubleshoot easily with software and

407
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:34,950
hardware issues if you are able to you

408
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,529
know navigate the system settings those

409
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,130
types of things systems administration

410
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,140
self-efficacy networking self-efficacy

411
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,020
web management self-efficacy and cyber

412
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,390
threat identification self-efficacy so

413
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,149
the latter for actually were very

414
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,870
specifically tied to the simulation

415
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:57,539
event that we had so again we use that

416
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,639
simulation point as sort of an end goal

417
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,980
because otherwise the cyber security

418
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,080
domain is just way too fuzzy and and

419
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,690
broad especially when we're working with

420
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,610
young adults who you know may have very

421
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,620
very

422
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,979
emerging knowledge about these these

423
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,629
constructs so those systems admin

424
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,940
networking web management cyber threat

425
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,630
identification were all components of

426
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,790
our simulation environment and the

427
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,980
feedback that I'm wanting to get for

428
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,540
more experts is well in your

429
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,830
applications what the cyber security

430
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,210
mean or what does cybersecurity

431
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,980
self-efficacy translate into so these

432
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,350
specifically the letter for our sort of

433
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,420
specific to our simulation but I would

434
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,850
be willing to guess that these these

435
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,309
types of domains also translate to other

436
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,659
cyber security specifically gensifer

437
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:50,809
camps so what I did is I sort of took

438
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,460
these different areas and we created a

439
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,830
scale so the cyber security engagement

440
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,890
and self-efficacy scale and we

441
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,620
identified specific sub tasks related to

442
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,530
each of those domains that map to those

443
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,290
higher-level higher-order constructs and

444
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,928
so these are the the scales that items

445
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,250
that we created and many of the ones

446
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,059
from problem solving and general

447
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,950
computer self-efficacy were adapted from

448
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,559
existing instrumentation so there is

449
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,929
problem solving self-efficacy skills out

450
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,330
there and computer self general computer

451
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,790
self-efficacy scales and so a lot of

452
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:29,840
that I drew from in in the literature

453
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:33,710
and the things that were sort of new to

454
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,030
this particular scale we're in in this

455
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,130
subscale where the cybersecurity

456
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,940
education enjoyment and persistence and

457
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,080
so these are actually drawn from there's

458
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,470
international assessments that we use to

459
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,510
gauge our you know relative position to

460
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:54,440
other students in other countries and

461
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:58,910
that the UNESCO essentially in the OECD

462
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,010
essentially coordinates so the trends in

463
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:05,240
international mathematics and science

464
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,980
study and the program and international

465
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,190
student achievement so the pizza and the

466
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,740
Tim's oh I looked at those and adapted

467
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,900
some of the the wording to be relative

468
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,700
to cyber security so again for those

469
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,830
particular assessments at science and

470
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,879
math oriented but I really wanted to

471
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,809
make sure that

472
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:27,498
the wording and length and the way in

473
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:30,079
which I was wording things was sort of a

474
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:31,639
good practice I'll say and and that's

475
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,489
why I looked at those instruments

476
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:40,039
because those are sort of vetted and and

477
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:41,719
we use those a lot in education so I as

478
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,509
students we asked in this particular

479
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:46,549
subscale to rate themselves and the

480
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:49,039
degree to which they agreed or disagreed

481
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,649
and this is just a basic Likert scale

482
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,929
where you know one is equals to strongly

483
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,809
disagree and five equals strongly agree

484
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,789
and if they're good at problem solving

485
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:00,408
persistent until a solutions found

486
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,839
confidence in their ability to meet

487
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:06,139
unexpected challenges so on and so forth

488
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:08,329
so again these were sort of designed to

489
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:11,508
map up to the higher order constructs

490
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:15,948
now in applied statistics which again is

491
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:19,129
also my background I would ideally have

492
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:22,549
a large sample of participants so that I

493
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:25,369
could see if indeed these items did map

494
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,829
most strongly to the domains that I am

495
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:30,019
expecting them to so hoping that I am

496
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,908
good at problem solving has a very

497
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,589
strong loading onto the problem solving

498
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,409
in general computer self-efficacy scale

499
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,178
a stronger loading that it has to the

500
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:40,789
cybersecurity education and joy Montano

501
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,289
sistance scale okay in this case I

502
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:45,529
wasn't able to do that because we only

503
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:47,259
had 36 participants we actually had 37

504
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,519
participants because someone showed up

505
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:52,369
and just thought that they had

506
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,139
registered for the camp so we we didn't

507
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:56,418
have anyone drop out we had somebody

508
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:59,389
that was not invited come which we

509
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,219
thought was really kind of cool but

510
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:03,079
ideally in the future what i would do is

511
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:07,879
collect more data so that we were able

512
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:10,369
to establish those perform of a factor

513
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,569
analysis essentially so here we see the

514
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,218
problem solving in general computer

515
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:16,299
self-efficacy scale the cybersecurity

516
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:20,059
enjoyment and persistence subscale and

517
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:21,529
here I've got two dimensions for the

518
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,109
other sub skill so there's four other

519
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,579
subscales that pertain to that list that

520
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:29,089
I heard the map the head showed you so

521
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:32,178
systems admin networking web management

522
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:33,470
and cyber threat identification and each

523
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:35,140
of those we

524
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,120
thought had two different dimensions so

525
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,419
again what you're seeing here on the far

526
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,059
right-hand side of the screen are those

527
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,940
specific sub tasks that are going to be

528
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,399
related to those higher ordered or

529
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,640
domain so being able to access systems

530
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,679
users and systems users and accounts is

531
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,070
going to be was specifically related to

532
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,100
systems administration ok but within

533
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,230
those certain domains I thought it was

534
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:07,280
really important to differentiate

535
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,500
between your ability to do and feel that

536
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,950
you can do that task and your ability to

537
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,490
understand what it entails and there's a

538
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,929
little push back in terms of you know if

539
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,669
there was really a distinction between

540
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,010
those things but I thought it was really

541
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,490
important I think you it's possible to

542
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,289
know how to do something but to not feel

543
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,250
confident in your ability to do it so I

544
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,408
thought that was kind of a really

545
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,620
important thing to differentiate between

546
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,289
so you'll see some redundancy in you

547
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,658
know the access systems users in

548
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:42,169
accounts and in both of those but they

549
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:44,809
pertain specifically to your ability to

550
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:47,059
completely understand it and your

551
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,549
confidence in your ability to perform it

552
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:51,668
ok so those are what we call sort of a

553
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:56,150
multi-dimensional in this case a by

554
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:58,120
dimensional scale so i have yet to look

555
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,320
to see if the to look at the

556
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,729
relationship between those two

557
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,590
dimensions but that's definitely

558
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,710
something i'll i'll be looking at when i

559
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,260
get a larger pool of participants so

560
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,309
those two dimensions are reflected in

561
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:16,908
these others subscales for self-efficacy

562
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:20,690
and what we ended up doing for each of

563
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:22,309
these scales was measuring it at a few

564
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,169
different time points and what that

565
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:29,120
allows us to do as camp directors as

566
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:32,419
researchers is to determine whether or

567
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,030
not the people that were giving this

568
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:38,240
program to our students our campers are

569
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,039
actually increasing over time a lot of

570
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,309
times what happens in self-efficacy

571
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,049
research is people particularly males

572
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,908
may rate themselves higher when they

573
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:49,639
come into a task into an environment

574
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:52,340
and then when they get exposed to that

575
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:54,349
actual environment what happens is South

576
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,720
Africa see doesn't necessarily increase

577
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:59,479
but it might actually decrease because

578
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,299
what you start to understand is all of

579
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:04,669
the things that you don't know and so

580
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,399
your efficacy actually goes down and so

581
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,859
sometimes you'll see some curvature in

582
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,570
in growth there in the growth trajectory

583
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,570
and so that was something I had sort of

584
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,460
anticipated particularly because some of

585
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,649
the students were rating them or campers

586
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,710
I'll call them rated themselves highly

587
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:23,869
when they when they came on board so in

588
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,779
order to be able to do that I had to

589
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,418
collect data at three time points so my

590
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,729
sort of applied area statistics is in

591
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,909
growth modeling and multi-level modeling

592
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:37,669
so essentially what that means is that

593
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:40,249
in traditional statistics you sort of

594
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:42,679
assume that your observations are all

595
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:45,070
independent but when you have those

596
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,179
observations nested within people

597
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,769
they're not independent because it's

598
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,090
coming from the same person some of

599
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:52,129
those observations are coming from the

600
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,668
same source so you have to actually

601
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:59,209
control for that variance or lack

602
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:03,080
thereof that is at that higher level so

603
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:05,029
in order to be able to model growth

604
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,789
efficiently you have to have at least

605
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:09,979
three time points and so we got some

606
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,929
feedback on the at the end of the week

607
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:13,070
one of the comments I asked you know

608
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,960
what did you like most what did you like

609
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,629
least and one of the people have

610
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,399
responded no more surveys stop serving

611
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:21,649
me so that was that's definitely a

612
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:25,129
caveat a trade-off but I got my data so

613
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:27,289
I didn't care about that comment but so

614
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:28,728
in order to get that data you do have to

615
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,029
have three time points and so what I've

616
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:34,039
shown here is the reliability and the

617
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,869
reliability for the scales is actually

618
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,210
when I ran this because of course as

619
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:39,949
soon as um as a statistician as a

620
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,349
researcher as soon as you get the data

621
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,779
it was all digitally uncollected I'm

622
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:47,029
running the numbers as they come in I

623
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:49,849
run back to my office and I was so

624
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:51,830
excited because essentially these are

625
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,840
indicating that the instrumentation is

626
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:58,309
is pretty reliable it's pretty good that

627
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,809
the items that if a person is responding

628
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:04,379
high on an item

629
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:08,010
and lower on another item and they have

630
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,080
the same ability as another person that

631
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,090
person is a similar pattern of how

632
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,428
they're scoring okay so that's

633
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,860
essentially what reliability is stating

634
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:20,010
and we see some fluctuation across the

635
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,219
administration but in I'll see to that

636
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,530
this is a the chromebox alpha so it's

637
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,530
essentially each of these is an index

638
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,420
between zero and one with one being you

639
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,450
know a perfect reliability which is

640
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,520
never the case such that you know the

641
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,100
items are sort of inter correlating

642
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,379
really well together now there's another

643
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,230
type of reliability in which you are

644
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,320
trying to determine the consistency and

645
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,970
scores across administration and that's

646
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,159
not the type of reliability that I

647
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,140
wanted to look at because my thinking

648
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,010
was that there's going to be differences

649
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,830
in your scale scaling across time so I

650
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,840
expected the items to not be

651
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,149
consistently related across

652
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,309
administrations okay so when you're

653
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,110
looking at specific types of reliability

654
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,389
you have to make sure that you're using

655
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,500
the right one because the inner item or

656
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:16,350
I'm sorry the not the inner item the

657
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,299
time based reliability it was was not

658
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,040
good because essentially what was it was

659
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,889
showing is that there's growth over time

660
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:27,299
there's fluctuation but the inner this

661
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:30,350
internal consistency was really good in

662
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:34,770
order to make sure that you know my

663
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,689
scale is I'm able to run the statistics

664
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,470
that I want to run on it we have to make

665
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,690
sure that it's meeting certain

666
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,870
assumptions and that includes normality

667
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,809
and so what this is showing is a QQ plot

668
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,959
that is essentially plotting we want it

669
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:51,990
to sort of show that 45 degree angle and

670
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,260
in this case again it didn't this is

671
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:58,470
specific to the overall z-scores so it

672
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,450
again the z-scores are where you are

673
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,880
standardizing all the scores on the

674
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,610
scale to have a mean of zero and a

675
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,370
standard deviation of one and what that

676
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,020
allows us to do is put it into terms so

677
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,428
if we create Z scores for all these

678
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,200
different subscales they're all on that

679
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:17,049
same scale okay because they all have

680
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,879
different item numbers and the sums are

681
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,860
the averages are going to be different

682
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:23,199
across all of those scales so what

683
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,998
z-scores do is they standardized it and

684
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,740
anytime you see a standardized score

685
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:29,529
usually what we're we're talking about

686
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,139
is a z-score with a mean of zero with

687
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:34,509
and a standard deviation of one and so

688
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:36,939
this is a plot of those overall z-scores

689
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,970
at one administration I think it was the

690
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,039
post simulation administration and again

691
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,679
a good results showing that I have

692
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,059
pretty good normal like I can go ahead

693
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,610
and run the statistics that I want to

694
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:51,970
run because I have met the assumption of

695
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:55,178
normality the next thing that i did is i

696
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,419
looked at the distribution by gender

697
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:00,279
across administration and so you'll see

698
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:02,230
here that the the girls are in the blue

699
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,110
and the in the males are in the green

700
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:08,350
and essentially these are the overall

701
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,168
z-scores and you able to see these are

702
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,149
what we call box and whisker plots where

703
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:16,240
you have sort of the interquartile range

704
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:18,518
so the meat of the majority of the the

705
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,740
data is going to be in those boxes the

706
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,690
whiskers extend out to the range of the

707
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,210
data and those little dots are

708
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,190
essentially a statistical outliers okay

709
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,600
so show some distribution we're also

710
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,119
seeing though this is where I first

711
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,779
started to think about oh wow I'm seeing

712
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:37,029
some gender differences right there a

713
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:40,629
baseline so again upon entry into our

714
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:43,960
camp girls are significantly lower and

715
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:46,240
they're much more homogeneous in terms

716
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,879
of their their scoring okay i'll see

717
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,519
with a caveat to that are we only had 10

718
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:52,990
females and we had 24 males but that

719
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,529
actually we were really proud of that

720
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:59,379
because thirty percent of our camp but

721
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,700
that is definitely a limitation and you

722
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,559
know the the results should be

723
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,249
interpreted you know with with that in

724
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,110
mind but again what we're seeing here is

725
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:09,730
that there's some differences across

726
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,629
males and females but we're also seeing

727
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:17,830
some upward trends across time so what's

728
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:19,748
happening is that initially people are

729
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,899
rating themselves lower specifically

730
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:25,330
females but that the boxes are tending

731
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,139
to move up over time all right so these

732
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,120
are the types of things

733
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,250
you do before you run any statistical

734
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,469
models because they allow you to sort of

735
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,800
think about the types of things that

736
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:39,280
you're wanting to look at and for me

737
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:41,850
specifically I might look at how I'm

738
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,050
going to code time because I may be

739
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:47,620
specifically looking at the difference

740
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:49,770
between baseline and post workshop or I

741
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,169
may be looking at the difference between

742
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,270
baseline to post simulation if I'm

743
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,100
interested in a specific time point the

744
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,920
way in which I code time is going to be

745
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,689
different so here what I just decided to

746
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,940
do is look at the overall trajectory and

747
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:10,810
in order to do that I essentially coated

748
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,030
time as zero one or two and you put that

749
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:16,600
into your equation and you're

750
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:20,410
essentially modeling both the I'll go

751
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,780
back to this previous slide you're

752
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:26,800
essentially looking at the difference in

753
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:32,230
males and females both at baseline but

754
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:34,750
also in terms of their slope okay so not

755
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,790
just the intercept which is baseline but

756
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,860
the slope so the average growth over

757
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,500
time so it's actually the average

758
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,350
between growth in baseline to workshop

759
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,070
or post workshop and then post workshop

760
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:51,419
to post simulation okay so it's that

761
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:55,210
slope is is what that is related to and

762
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:57,490
what I also did is I essentially took

763
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,590
the variable of gender and I regressed

764
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,200
it on to both the intercept and the

765
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,600
slope so that I'm able to see does

766
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,420
gender make a difference at baseline

767
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,959
okay but also does gender make a

768
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:13,780
difference in terms of your trajectory

769
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,960
so in other words are males and females

770
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:19,300
significantly different at the time that

771
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,460
they enter camp but also our males and

772
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,149
females significantly different in terms

773
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,880
of their growth rate ok so what tends to

774
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,140
happen a lot of times in educational

775
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,050
research where you're looking at growth

776
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,390
is that because in this case males were

777
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:37,750
significantly higher than females then

778
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,430
there's less room for them to grow right

779
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,789
so something that you have to account

780
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,369
for

781
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:44,440
or in the model is actually where this

782
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:46,899
where they start and that's what we call

783
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,210
a latent growth model and when you

784
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,850
essentially model the intercept as a

785
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,369
predictor of slope you have to look and

786
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,139
see if that is statistically significant

787
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:57,850
if it is then you have to make sure that

788
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,859
you are including it in your model and

789
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,019
you're making sure that you have

790
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:04,178
adjusted essentially for that ceiling or

791
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:06,789
in this case ceiling but sometimes a

792
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,190
floor effect in all of the cases that

793
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:11,859
wasn't there was no significant

794
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,079
intercept as a predictor of the slope so

795
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:17,679
but these essentially are late in growth

796
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,960
models what we did see and I'll just

797
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,159
point out just broadly some of the

798
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,609
results is so model one I just modeled

799
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,169
the time okay so model one is just

800
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,690
looking at time it's the average growth

801
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,578
across time so on average the way that

802
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,980
we can read this because I standardized

803
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:38,770
the scores and we know that time was

804
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,679
coated such a 0 to 1 and then 1 to 2

805
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:45,280
that an increase of one time point was

806
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,790
associated with a point 667 standard

807
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,139
deviation increase over time in overall

808
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:54,839
z-score okay on the on the scale and my

809
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,250
next question which is you know really

810
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,808
great because we really want that's what

811
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,450
we had wanted we wanted to show that

812
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,920
there was growth over time but the thing

813
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,589
that I was actually really interested in

814
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,079
was looking to see if when we're

815
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:10,270
modeling that slope if there was a

816
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,059
difference between gender or males and

817
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,579
females so a gender effect and that was

818
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:17,650
what I essentially tested and model too

819
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:21,220
so in model too you'll see that i

820
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:24,730
regressed gender both on the intercept

821
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:28,629
in that top part but also on time so in

822
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:31,329
this beta 1 1 that you see at the bottom

823
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,819
here and the the beta that's associated

824
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,520
with it that negative 0 point three five

825
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:40,420
six essentially what that means is that

826
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:44,410
on average there was growth over time

827
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,380
but being a male was associated with a

828
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:51,670
point three five six standard deviation

829
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,619
decrease in the slope okay so and that's

830
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,359
actually after controlling for

831
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,539
under the gender effect that we're

832
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,609
seeing initially at baseline and

833
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:03,579
controlling also for where where they

834
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:07,328
started so essentially what that saying

835
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:09,400
is that males are starting higher they

836
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:13,119
are raiding themselves as significantly

837
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,460
higher on the scale initially but that

838
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,670
the growth rate of the the females is

839
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,859
significantly higher than the the males

840
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,740
and the way that the reason that this

841
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:25,900
beta is negative is because males were

842
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,490
coded as one and females are coded as

843
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,190
zero so it's what we call a dummy code

844
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:32,019
and it's oftentimes what we do to

845
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,309
dichotomize even if you have a

846
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:35,229
continuous variable sometimes you'll

847
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:37,720
dichotomize it to kind of look at group

848
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:40,869
effects but in this case if I were to

849
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,680
switch it and code females as one and

850
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:46,930
males as zero then that gender effect in

851
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,970
this model would be positive okay so

852
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,598
that's it's just a the way that in which

853
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,328
the data were coded so visually this is

854
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,130
what it looked like and so again what

855
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:01,809
you're seeing here is males in the green

856
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:03,880
and females as the blue dots and again

857
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:06,700
females starting significantly lower at

858
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,140
baseline and so again sort of coming

859
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,220
back to the stuff that we're talking

860
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:14,200
about they have much less lower self

861
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,598
efficacy and all of those tests they are

862
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,029
not enjoying themselves as much they a

863
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,309
lot of the sort of anecdotal evidence i

864
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:24,759
was getting is my parents made me do

865
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:27,940
this no but by the end it was um they're

866
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:31,420
showing a significantly high growth in

867
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:33,400
south africa see and engagement so even

868
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,749
more so again than the males and that's

869
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,069
not to say that there was no growth in

870
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:38,649
the males we see here that there's

871
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:40,569
there's a positive trajectory and this

872
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,430
in and of itself is really promising to

873
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,109
me because we did this in such a short

874
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,089
period of time that again as i stated

875
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:48,880
before oftentimes with self-efficacy

876
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:52,749
will see a drop so i had actually

877
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,630
thought that at baseline we'd see some

878
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:57,069
stability but that possibly after the

879
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,079
workshop it might go down and maybe

880
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:01,239
after the simulation the simulation was

881
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,380
hard for them and so i had thought i was

882
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,749
like oh my gosh when i was like waiting

883
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,249
for the data i was like i I'm so nervous

884
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,339
because I really I want to have good

885
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,680
results and I want

886
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,210
came to have been successful so I was

887
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,069
really pleased to see that even after

888
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,980
the simulation which was difficult for a

889
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,770
lot of them that they still were raiding

890
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,900
themselves significantly higher than the

891
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,940
baseline and at that at the post

892
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:27,560
workshop so that was really exciting I

893
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:31,760
broke down some of the information to in

894
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,480
terms of subscales but I'm not sure if

895
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,980
I'm going to have time to go through

896
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,810
some of that but some of this it was

897
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,810
really interesting there was not as much

898
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,460
growth in some of the subscales in

899
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,570
problem solving in general computer

900
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:47,860
self-efficacy the trajectory was less

901
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:53,030
steep so it was a flatter curvature and

902
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:55,400
in every case there was a slight

903
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,720
increase but in some of the subscales it

904
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,020
wasn't significant so there was growth

905
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,270
overall but in some of the subscales

906
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,400
there was it wasn't statistically

907
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:07,730
significant that may be related to the

908
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,470
small sample size too so sort of

909
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,620
bringing this back into what it all

910
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:14,509
means it you know that females started

911
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:17,299
camp with significantly lower both

912
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,970
engagement and self-efficacy relative to

913
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,350
the males at our camp but they

914
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,810
demonstrated significantly greater

915
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,029
growth over the course of the week such

916
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,920
that we are we're able to essentially

917
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,580
close that gender gap and self-efficacy

918
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,790
engagement and actually reverse it right

919
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,970
because we see here in this slide that

920
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:41,029
females are starting to to keep going if

921
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,700
we extend those lines what would happen

922
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:47,140
if we had a post post post post post

923
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:49,790
simulation a time point you might see a

924
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,100
pretty big gender gap with a female

925
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,009
advantage okay so that's actually

926
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:58,660
something that has been starting to

927
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:01,850
happen in in education in general in

928
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:05,569
about 70 s 80s there was this huge sort

929
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:09,650
of push for a female in academics and

930
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,210
what's happening now is there stating

931
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,100
that we need to sort of reverse that

932
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,850
trend because we went a little too far

933
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:20,310
into the direction of you you know

934
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:23,339
females at this point are sort of

935
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:25,770
across the board completing college at a

936
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,240
greater rate than than males but again

937
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,490
like I stated before this leaky pipeline

938
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,069
in cyber and stem so that that's

939
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:35,819
something um that is is discipline

940
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:37,680
specific so by the end of the week the

941
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,000
gaps again like I stated except for in

942
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,330
the problem solving in the general

943
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,650
computer self-efficacy scale and the

944
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,600
enjoyment and persistence had

945
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:49,320
significantly decreased or even

946
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,720
disappeared in Reverse Stephen so again

947
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,430
the results here are preliminary because

948
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,410
there's only there were only 36

949
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:58,310
participants but it's definitely

950
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:00,690
promising to show that these types of

951
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:03,000
informal learning activities hands-on

952
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:06,000
activities that are outside of the

953
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,390
school and can sort of supplement and be

954
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,920
co-curricular can have a huge impact on

955
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,100
students actually we've had some of the

956
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,810
students you know email us and see if

957
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,029
we're going to be able to roll out of

958
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:21,000
camp this year they want to come back I

959
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,310
got one of the best emails you get you

960
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,040
get a lot of emails as a teacher and a

961
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:28,110
researcher some of them not so good to

962
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,509
hang on to the ones that are that make

963
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,940
you smile and I've had some from parents

964
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,740
that have reached out and said you know

965
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,550
I just want to thank you because you

966
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,500
know the my son or daughter is you know

967
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,540
still talking about their website and

968
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,520
all the things that they learned and you

969
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,900
know all the cool things that you were

970
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,700
able to show them so you know those

971
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,010
those types of things are really neat

972
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,960
because it's showing that these

973
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,700
experiences are going to resonate over

974
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,970
time so that's that's actually really

975
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,180
really cool but they can also be an

976
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,529
important part of again reducing the

977
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,230
gender gap that we're seeing in cyber

978
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,660
security not just education but career

979
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,020
path I mean really the the goal is to

980
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,020
create a national workforce that is a

981
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:17,220
you know competent and that is going to

982
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,660
help us maintain a secure society and in

983
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,220
order to do that we have to really start

984
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,069
to create these types of experiences

985
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,419
early on to get people excited and to

986
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,880
know that these types of opportunities

987
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,460
are out there that this is a career path

988
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,650
that we can go down and you know it

989
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,030
encouraged them but also create

990
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,140
opportunities for them to experience

991
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,119
success I think that

992
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,400
it's also a really important sort of

993
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,500
component of this is that they had fun

994
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,900
on some of the comments that we got were

995
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,609
I have made some friends where you know

996
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,829
we're still talking on on the social

997
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:49,558
network sites we were joking with them

998
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:52,079
and you know be careful what you post oh

999
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,200
I did include some of the trajectories

1000
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,760
here so these are by subscales and so

1001
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,939
we'll see here sort of at the top that

1002
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,460
the problem solving one is the the one

1003
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,349
with the flatter slope and again males

1004
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,260
being green and females being blue and

1005
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:09,750
the significant trajectory difference

1006
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,990
was actually in the networking

1007
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:16,200
self-efficacy and also systems

1008
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,538
administration self-efficacy and web

1009
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,000
management self-efficacy so the girls

1010
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,579
were specifically more inclined to

1011
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,289
demonstrate growth in those areas and I

1012
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,059
think this can actually I'm really glad

1013
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:30,240
that I was able to tease these out

1014
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:32,309
because it may be helpful to sort of

1015
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,759
identify the things that girls gravitate

1016
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:38,160
towards more relative to to female

1017
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,839
relative to males so I think sort of

1018
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,379
teasing out these different sub areas

1019
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,849
and domains is a really important

1020
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,569
component of you know the cyber research

1021
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,799
that we're going to continue to do so

1022
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:52,200
currently what this work is from the

1023
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:55,710
pilot study and is under review at

1024
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:59,578
several publication outlets and my plan

1025
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:02,069
for this forthcoming administration the

1026
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,680
gen cyber initiative is the call for

1027
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:07,200
proposals request for proposals was was

1028
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,109
just published at the end of november

1029
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,049
and so we're going to submit another one

1030
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:15,359
and hopefully get that under way and

1031
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:18,089
what i would do is is revised the scale

1032
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,890
a bit through feedback from other

1033
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,930
experts and at different conferences

1034
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,240
I've been picking up on some other

1035
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:27,180
domains that I think might be important

1036
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,430
to look at so risk assessment or some

1037
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,538
general security awareness I think might

1038
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,799
be something that we should tap into and

1039
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,079
you know I encourage you i'll put my

1040
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:39,089
information up here to as experts in the

1041
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,390
field because that's essentially what

1042
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:44,038
what you're doing um if you see any

1043
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:46,109
glaring discrepancies or something that

1044
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:47,710
you think is missing please let me know

1045
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:49,299
because I'm relying on

1046
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,970
other people's input as i've stated i'm

1047
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,740
not an expert in this i mean i'm an

1048
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:57,098
expert in I tell this to my husband I'm

1049
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,540
an expert in cybersecurity engagement

1050
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,230
and self-efficacy that doesn't

1051
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,520
necessarily mean cyber security cell but

1052
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:05,800
obviously further validation is

1053
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,710
necessary my hope is to get an IRB

1054
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,950
through so we can evaluate some of this

1055
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:14,410
in college students and a Gentile 2016

1056
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:16,930
is specifically at UB but also maybe

1057
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:20,410
extension into industry so looking at

1058
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:23,109
how employees in networking and in

1059
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:26,379
systems administration and in different

1060
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:28,960
sectors of information technology if

1061
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,390
they're it you know if the scale holds

1062
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,839
if this South Africa see component is is

1063
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:38,560
something that is also validated in and

1064
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:40,810
in those in that adult population so

1065
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,599
that's sort of where we're we're looking

1066
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:46,509
next hand again as I stated if you have

1067
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,430
any questions you know or feedback for

1068
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,380
me I really really want you to email me

1069
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:53,020
because again as I stated and we're

1070
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:56,440
relying on the people the experts of

1071
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,900
whom you are and I'm excited and look

1072
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:05,050
forward to speaking with you so if

1073
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:06,730
anyone has any questions sure oh so then

1074
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,260
you kind of also look at the reasons

1075
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:12,310
behind the different levels of growth

1076
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:15,490
across gender so at the end of your

1077
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:18,190
workshop the females were doing better

1078
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,629
in self efficacy than the males so is

1079
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,910
there research out there that explains

1080
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:24,790
this phenomena or did you kind of look

1081
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:28,569
at some of the reasons behind that so

1082
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:30,520
qualitatively we didn't we did capture

1083
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:36,040
other information that I haven't looked

1084
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:38,920
at so I'm wondering if um a lot of what

1085
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,040
I saw his females in at the camp were

1086
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,450
buddying up so they made friends and so

1087
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,060
I almost wonder if there's sort of a

1088
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:48,189
social effect there the male's also made

1089
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,380
friends and you know thought but a lot

1090
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,660
of what happened I thought the girls at

1091
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,420
beginning felt kind of isolated and so I

1092
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:58,149
think that um community a fact and that

1093
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,619
sort of social aspect might feed into

1094
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,910
some of that self-efficacy growth

1095
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:02,530
because when you

1096
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,910
see somebody else actually something

1097
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,640
that's really important in self-efficacy

1098
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,580
if you see someone else that you see is

1099
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,830
similar to you experiencing success then

1100
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,660
you feel like you can be successful okay

1101
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:16,960
so i always use this analogy when i'm

1102
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,850
teaching you guys have her gone like

1103
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,690
cliff diving or like jumped off a cliff

1104
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:25,029
into water I just off a cliff but in the

1105
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,430
water ok well there's like a cliff near

1106
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,740
us and I could never do it I was always

1107
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,330
so scared and then I saw my friend do it

1108
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:35,080
and I was like okay well if she can do

1109
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:37,569
it then I can do it okay so that's sort

1110
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,640
of present yeah I could give it serves

1111
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,410
of you know seeing somebody else do

1112
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,180
something that in you specifically if

1113
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,460
you see that that person is similar to

1114
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:49,259
you an age gender that type of thing can

1115
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:52,450
be really important we did also look at

1116
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,800
gaming so something I also thought might

1117
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:57,040
be important to look at is different

1118
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,440
types of like console gaming mobile

1119
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,880
gaming that actually didn't make a

1120
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,450
difference in growth or anything like

1121
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,680
that but student 13 and 14 year olds

1122
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:11,290
spend many hours a day on their mobile

1123
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,750
devices on games and a few of them in

1124
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:20,650
excess of six hours so according to my

1125
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:24,600
survey any other questions sure after

1126
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,600
the camp assistant show an interest

1127
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:49,440
oh do me to give her this one that is it

1128
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:51,240
on now okay okay so do you plan on you

1129
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,960
know tracking those participants and see

1130
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,578
if they still have any Justin working on

1131
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,079
stuff they learned in the camp or how

1132
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,910
much they've involved with the field

1133
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:04,470
after they left the camp excellent

1134
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:07,529
question I know honestly ideally yes we

1135
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:11,339
would love to do that the issue comes

1136
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:12,660
down to money a lot of times we want

1137
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,549
that longitudinal research because

1138
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,930
essentially that's our end goal we I

1139
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:18,029
would love to track every single one of

1140
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:21,419
the people that I've surveyed not just

1141
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:24,029
post six months but in a year in two

1142
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,339
years through college hey how you doing

1143
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:28,710
when you're 30 what are you doing 30

1144
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:30,240
because that's the goal that's the

1145
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,990
that's the angle that takes a lot of

1146
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,029
time in resources that's definitely

1147
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,379
something that you know where we're

1148
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:39,450
looking at doing is a smaller

1149
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,819
longitudinal study and longitudinal

1150
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,009
