1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,160
good afternoon welcome to the serious

2
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,699
security seminar it's my great pleasure

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,220
to introduce today's speaker kami Vania

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,350
kami is the assistant professor in

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,589
school of informatics in Indiana

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,050
University Bloomington our neighbor and

7
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,360
she received her PhD from the Carnegie

8
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,220
Mellon University her research are in

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,920
human factors in security and privacy

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,610
and today he will tell us about her

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,210
research in understanding why people

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,730
apply or not apply software updates

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,350
thank you so uh as he already stated

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,300
we're going to be talking about software

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,690
updates today and I actually really

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,640
appreciate this XKCD comic which I will

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,920
note came out after I did this research

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,740
I did not base my research on the xkcd

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,979
comment to read it to you it says urgent

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,020
critical update available details fixes

21
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,670
an issue that was causing random laptop

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,550
electrical fires do you think might be

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,500
serious on hits this update will require

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,619
you restarting your computer and so of

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,140
course he clicks remind me later if you

26
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,689
measure put a mouse over this it says I

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,759
had too many windows open this is

28
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,320
actually a beautiful type of vacation

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,770
for why people aren't necessarily

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,258
installing updates and really people

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,939
aren't installing updates so most of the

32
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:48,509
people in this room probably recall the

33
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,179
heartbleed vulnerability from last year

34
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,210
Hartley was a very serious vulnerability

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,969
infecting openssl if few when said it

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,589
specifically crafted connection request

37
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:01,559
to a server it would start dumping parts

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,079
of its memory this is serious problem

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,259
and it infected 600,000 vulnerabilities

40
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,758
this thought our servers this kind of

41
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,559
has a nice story too though because

42
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,820
shortly after we found the vulnerability

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,040
we figured out what was causing it and

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,500
we fixed it right and we fixed it by

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,890
installing a software update patch which

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,000
is how we normally fix these things

47
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,109
unfortunately the story since then is

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,420
not always quite as good so 600,000

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,150
server is initially vulnerable after one

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,079
month we got to a half life we patched

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,390
half so 300,000 servers two months later

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,470
we still have 300,000 servers of

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,630
vulnerable and now a year later were at

54
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:48,130
200,000 servers we only managed to patch

55
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,620
two thirds uh I really like software

56
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,970
updates as a particular research

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,910
direction because they represent what I

58
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,010
like to think of as solved problems some

59
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,329
researcher out there some security

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,970
professional figured out how to fix

61
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,040
hardly this is a solved problem we know

62
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,070
how to fix heartbleed this is not a

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,560
mystery there is no concern about how to

64
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,900
do this and the patches are working on

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,100
very large servers out there the server

66
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,650
but the patches themselves are not

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,600
broken they function but we're still

68
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,350
looking at a third of the servers that

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,609
are still vulnerable and this isn't just

70
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,410
an issue for you know big servers out

71
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,730
there for as you'll about to find out a

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,340
majority of my research is actually

73
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:33,340
about individuals this is a study done

74
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,239
by Microsoft of 10,000 Windows computers

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,340
worldwide then statistic I'm kind of

76
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,140
kind of draw your your eye to here is

77
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,320
java and i'm going to picking on java

78
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,720
the length of this talk seventy-two

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,000
percent of java installations worldwide

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,040
are not updated for anyone who

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,350
understands where security

82
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,560
vulnerabilities tend to come from java

83
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,200
is really high on this list uh in fact

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,180
if we were to look at the list this is a

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
list out of microsoft security

86
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,190
intelligence report they ranked the most

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,400
commonly attacked pieces of software so

88
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,570
for when or for windows computers

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,940
they're running their protection

90
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,769
software these are the piece of software

91
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,769
that malicious code is attempting to

92
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:21,608
break into java is its own category by

93
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:25,750
itself and it ranks only below the

94
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:28,020
internet which is you know HTML and

95
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,820
javascript this is a serious problem

96
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,469
also note adobe reader or down on number

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,560
four accounts for ninety percent of that

98
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:40,539
category updates are prominent and and

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,990
they're solved in many ways i mean most

100
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,200
people actually get compromised by a

101
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,849
vulnerability for which Apaches this is

102
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,409
the most commonly attack method there

103
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,000
exists a patch you could have been saved

104
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,000
but you

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,710
why why aren't people install ea's and

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,330
because I do this presentation too many

107
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,739
audiences of many mixed backgrounds

108
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,359
actually going to take a my toes set

109
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,680
background it back and talk briefly

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,060
about why on earth these things matter

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,490
so bear with me for a moment if you know

112
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,490
this so a softer update at a very high

113
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,110
level does one thing and that's take an

114
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,430
existing piece of software you currently

115
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,290
have and change it into a slightly

116
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,400
different piece of software the one I

117
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,080
just demoed here is iTunes actually

118
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,200
before and after my study so before my

119
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,539
study it has the sidebar on the left

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,370
after or right before my study they

121
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,720
changed the entire user interface they

122
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,660
switched everything up these are in fact

123
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,240
the same page before and after an update

124
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,950
an update just effectively goes in and

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,110
takes this thing you had before throws

126
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,000
that out and puts a new thing in there

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,590
now sometimes what it throws out is very

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,930
tiny and sometimes when it turns out is

129
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,369
very large but effectively what's doing

130
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,030
is taking something you already had

131
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:55,150
running and changing very high level but

132
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,820
go one level deeper what it does is you

133
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,400
have many different programs on your

134
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,110
computer and some of those programs have

135
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,780
holes or issues with them and so when

136
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,000
you try and you say adobe reader to open

137
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,150
a file that is malicious and your

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,890
version of adobe reader is old then the

139
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,929
malicious software our target known

140
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,310
vulnerabilities and we use that to

141
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,020
compromise your computer's gain access

142
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,670
to being able to do things that you

143
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,070
don't necessarily want to have available

144
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,290
if you were to update it if you closed

145
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,270
those holes then you and you have to

146
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,670
open the same file what will happen is

147
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,289
either nothing or the file will just

148
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,750
crash because it's going to attempt to

149
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,370
do something that the hooks that the

150
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,210
piece is there that it's targeting are

151
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,860
missing i sometimes describe this to

152
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,630
people ask me why aren't we just using

153
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,060
anti viruses if you think of this as a

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,580
castle we can either start blocking up

155
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,260
all the gates so there's less ways to

156
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,580
even get into the castle or we can start

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,930
hiring more guards java adobe reader

158
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,640
these are the sorts of programs that

159
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,890
have a lot of open gates and every time

160
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,380
we find one we patch it we close it and

161
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,460
then we don't need as many guards

162
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,680
because there are less ways to get into

163
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,299
the system and so that's just that's a

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,740
really high level but what

165
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,889
we're really concerned here is why are

166
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,289
people not updating software why are we

167
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,449
having this problem and to answer that

168
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,669
this is research I did well still a

169
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,310
postdoc at Michigan State with Rick wash

170
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,590
and Emily reader we did a multi-method

171
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,180
study so what we did was we brought in

172
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:27,219
participants we ran a custom powershell

173
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,509
script on their computers to collect a

174
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,419
lot of information about settings

175
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,860
information about log files basically

176
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,539
being opportunistic about what's

177
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,210
typically recorded by the average

178
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,710
Windows machine we had them fill out a

179
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,568
survey in the lab to get some structured

180
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,818
information and then we did an hour-long

181
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,169
interview with them asking them about a

182
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,819
couple different scenarios and

183
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,710
specifically trying to get them to talk

184
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,360
about prior experiences they'd had with

185
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:55,989
updates and how they they frame

186
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:58,330
decisions involving updates we use 37

187
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,979
non-technical graduate students now keep

188
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,448
in mind this is graduate students this

189
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:06,878
is a convenient sample their age ages

190
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,639
are pretty good and we surprisingly got

191
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,029
a pretty good mix of male and female I

192
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,319
will however note that even though we're

193
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,060
looking at graduate students that

194
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,590
theoretically have their theses on their

195
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,810
machines and you know their research

196
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,690
data on their machines we were not

197
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,759
looking at in many ways this is a more

198
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,680
educated group this is a group that has

199
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,380
something that they want to protect and

200
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,078
tie their computer and we're still

201
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,990
seeing this many security issues so our

202
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:37,539
participants 15 of them had at least one

203
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,209
major security issues six had antivirus

204
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,588
installed or not installed or disabled

205
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:46,630
in some way to turn their firewalls off

206
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,820
seven had either completely turned off

207
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,560
user account control or change it to a

208
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,149
lower setting for those of you who don't

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,979
know what user account control is it's

210
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,620
the thing that makes windows ask you

211
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,300
before it installed software if it's off

212
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,620
windows doesn't ask you before

213
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,719
installing software six of them had

214
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,990
either turned off windows update or

215
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,070
unlimited it in some way so we're not

216
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,399
nests are perhaps a better sample we're

217
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,050
still seeing a fair number of problems

218
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,649
also I realize I probably have a lot of

219
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,839
mac users

220
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,240
in the audience you may not have had

221
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,639
this Windows Update experience happen to

222
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,350
you very often so I'm going to spend a

223
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,480
moment explaining how Windows Update

224
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,670
works this is a fairly complicated

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,629
graphic what we're going to focus on is

226
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,910
the three boxes that are colored so the

227
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:38,679
first box is as blue box entitled

228
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,569
scheduled so what windows does is it

229
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,550
goes out periodically on your behalf and

230
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:45,099
looks to see if there's any new updates

231
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,899
just checks for on your behalf it just

232
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,759
checks for them what finds one it

233
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,860
automatically pulls it down and then

234
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,050
creates a scheduled time period for it

235
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,459
to be updated and notifies you it puts

236
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,279
up a little dialogue in the corner that

237
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,649
just says their updates available you

238
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,899
should install them and then it moves

239
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,959
into the green box which I like to think

240
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,850
of as the hands-off box it just doesn't

241
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,410
do anything unless the user decides to

242
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,970
do something this is the moment in which

243
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,249
the user is given the opportunity to

244
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:15,610
find a convenient time to update their

245
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:17,499
software so you know if you were busy

246
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,970
this is when you have the chance to go

247
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:20,740
and pick that point when you're not busy

248
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,499
before you do the software update maybe

249
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,110
need to redo the reboot if you fail to

250
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,759
get this done before 3am the computer

251
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,339
will do it for you we move into the red

252
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,319
box the forced one so what will happen

253
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,850
is Windows is decided well this is a

254
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,889
major security problem we need to

255
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,600
install it so 3 a.m. or soon thereafter

256
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,120
it just starts installing all the

257
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,769
updates once it's finished installing

258
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,059
the updates it decides if it needs a

259
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,519
reboot by the way it doesn't actually

260
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,499
always need a reboot if it does need a

261
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,529
reboot it starts with I like to think of

262
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:51,999
as the countdown dialog where it starts

263
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,529
at ten minutes and if you don't catch

264
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,759
the dialogue before the end of ten

265
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,129
minutes your computer automatically

266
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,600
reboots if you do catch the dialog you

267
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:00,639
can't get rid of it all you can do is

268
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,259
delay it by a maximum of four hours at

269
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,799
which point it pops back up again and if

270
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,970
you miss it your computer reboots and

271
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,949
then obviously at the end of this

272
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,709
process you have an updated computer and

273
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:16,269
this is actually one of the outputs of

274
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:18,189
this research because this was very

275
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:20,019
non-obvious to our participants this

276
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,089
wasn't even necessarily obvious to me

277
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,730
beforehand how this structure works and

278
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,990
it's really interesting because in many

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,509
ways it's trying to be polite to

280
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,329
end-users it's giving you an opportunity

281
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,329
to determine whether or not you

282
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,618
want to install an update right now and

283
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,059
it's giving you that time frame in order

284
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:39,399
to figure it out I should note that this

285
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:40,719
is also windows 7 windows 8 does

286
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,149
something very similar but the time

287
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,579
frame is larger I believe it gives you

288
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,929
two days and through experimentation I

289
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,579
can tell you you can push that two days

290
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:53,199
to about a week before it starts having

291
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:56,979
a fit and it forces this reboot alright

292
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:59,199
so that I'm going to start by talking

293
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,179
about the log files so this is the the

294
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,738
more structured information we pull this

295
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,439
information almost exclusively about

296
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:07,600
windows itself because it's very verbose

297
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,069
in its logging and many of the other

298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,119
programs weren't or were harder to

299
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:14,589
extract this login permission actually

300
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:17,889
backing up just half a second so our

301
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:20,470
participants actually had three

302
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,790
different possible levels for automatic

303
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,579
software updates so if I go back to the

304
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,339
prior box off is off it doesn't do any

305
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:30,309
of this if you have it set to notify

306
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,749
only it only does the blue box so all

307
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,949
it'll do is check for updates and let

308
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,600
you know that they're there but it won't

309
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:36,488
try to automatically do anything and

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,079
then the default setting is to do

311
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,059
everything on this graph where I

312
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,618
automatically spots them gives you a

313
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,719
moment to install them and if you fail

314
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:46,959
to install them it will install them for

315
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,549
you and as you'd expect we have this

316
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,040
sort of layout so the majority of people

317
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,749
had the default setting for participants

318
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,248
had changed its notified so it won't

319
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:56,379
automatically install it'll just tell

320
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:59,860
them to install and two of them had

321
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,929
completely disabled when looking at the

322
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,660
windows logs what we're interested in is

323
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:06,040
really two questions our users

324
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,799
installing updates and our users

325
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,059
installing updates quickly so if they're

326
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,429
not installing the updates they are

327
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,709
going to become vulnerable period end of

328
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,919
story if they're not installing the

329
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:19,809
updates quickly they're they're

330
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,079
installing them but they have this time

331
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:24,459
frame which they're vulnerable so again

332
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,488
if you're not familiar with how updates

333
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:29,979
work what tends to happen is Microsoft's

334
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,350
a pushes out an update all the bad guys

335
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,239
download the update they install it and

336
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,499
then they take the old version and the

337
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,970
new version and they say what's

338
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,829
different between these two versions

339
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,350
because what's different is where the

340
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,969
hole is as soon as they find the hole

341
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,740
they start writing malicious software

342
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,620
which means that

343
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,690
as soon as an update is published as

344
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,390
soon as it becomes publicly available be

345
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:56,860
a number of pieces of malicious software

346
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:58,209
targeting it skyrockets every paper I've

347
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,560
seen has a different number and it's

348
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:01,089
usually somewhere between like four

349
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,149
hundred percent increase in several

350
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:06,760
thousand percent increase so the faster

351
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,339
you install updates the safer you will

352
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,810
be and so it is important that not only

353
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:15,550
they are installing them but that they

354
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,750
are installing them quickly so I'm just

355
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,579
going to lean forward and see what

356
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,670
whether or not yellow okay good yellow

357
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,620
is showing up alright so what you are

358
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,390
looking at here is all of our

359
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,220
participants on each participant is a

360
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,589
dot green dots are the people who are

361
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,149
automatic yellow dots the people who are

362
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,350
just being notified and read people

363
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:38,260
weren't installing updates so they're

364
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:41,620
not on this graph I know it's a little

365
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,760
hard to see but I believe yeah so this

366
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,649
is 200 here people are installing a lot

367
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,329
of updates it's actually shocking the

368
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,100
number of updates Windows pulls down at

369
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,439
any given moment and it's installing at

370
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,240
all times but what you are seeing here

371
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,670
is a big difference between the yellow

372
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,279
and the green dots unfortunately we kind

373
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,770
of have too few people that have notify

374
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,060
settings to reliably do statistics on

375
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,860
this but we're not seeing a horrific

376
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,060
setting here in fact they are installing

377
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,240
these updates and they're installing

378
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,859
that it very similar time periods also

379
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,620
if you can't tell this is months own

380
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:19,180
this is at 20 months so a year is

381
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,529
sitting about here all right so if we're

382
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,149
not seeing many differences in the

383
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,579
numbers installed let's look at the time

384
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:27,070
to patch now we are seeing some

385
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:29,439
differences here again yellow is the

386
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,770
number of people are the people who have

387
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,480
notified setting in this case this is

388
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,529
dazed update so a month is sitting at

389
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,730
the center of the graph here the we're

390
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,630
looking at about a hundred and fifty

391
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:47,920
updates per person and the median is six

392
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,980
days for the notify condition and 2.6

393
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,360
days for the automatic so we are seeing

394
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,420
difference but keep in mind we can only

395
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,350
have four users so let's break this out

396
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,540
so you're looking at basically the same

397
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,540
graph here but I've sorted

398
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,160
it by the medians starting from the

399
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,500
lowest median on the left to the highest

400
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,449
median on the right what's really

401
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,090
interesting about this is that for the

402
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,220
majority of the notify participants the

403
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,960
median is actually sitting way down at

404
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,320
the bottom of these box and whisker

405
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,610
plots this person actually doesn't use

406
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,950
their machine a lots they have a lot of

407
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:25,090
variation same story with these green

408
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:28,150
ones nearby it isn't ah they told me to

409
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,040
do that all right so you can kind of see

410
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:34,569
here at the bottom of the yellow boxes

411
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:37,120
that the median sitting at the bottom

412
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,180
these people are actually installing

413
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,140
these updates most of the time fairly

414
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,300
quickly and then on occasional timeframe

415
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,490
there they're delaying it for a long

416
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,959
time now if you try to delay it and

417
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,240
you're on automatic the windows has a

418
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,190
fit and automatically installs it for

419
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,050
you and just forces the reboot which is

420
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,740
why we see most the green people sitting

421
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:02,140
down at the lower ends here if you don't

422
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,150
then you have the option to delay it for

423
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,349
longer but this is actually this is kind

424
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,390
of a mixed story because on one hand

425
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,829
it's actually really good we're seeing a

426
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,860
lot of people installing it quickly even

427
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,889
though they have notify and we're seeing

428
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:19,179
it work properly for the automatic

429
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,230
settings but you know we are also seeing

430
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,150
the sort of thing we're concerned about

431
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,339
which is this greater delay that's

432
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,940
happening so it's kind of a mixed bag

433
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,669
yeah why you have this long grain bars

434
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,620
so if it's automatic why up they take

435
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,170
that long they don't know the completely

436
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,600
time difference between when the patch

437
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,850
was published by Microsoft and one is

438
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,919
installed by the laptop Christmas

439
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,570
particularly for graduate students is a

440
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,520
time period where they might like close

441
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,659
the laptop and not open it again for two

442
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,720
or three weeks and that causes this

443
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,430
situation across both experimentally I

444
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,620
tried to figure out if I could determine

445
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,080
if the machines were on or off and then

446
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,939
subtract that time period but we didn't

447
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,800
have on/off logs for them for a long

448
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,990
enough time frame if you look at it for

449
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,020
just the time frame when we did have it

450
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,760
it starts looking a lot better but I'm

451
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,330
iffy on saying that because we don't

452
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,269
have enough

453
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,309
nation so another question is one of I

454
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:18,429
guess two slides back you show there's a

455
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:21,100
one yellow dot which installed more

456
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,710
updates than the other green one this is

457
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,870
because some of the if the update is not

458
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,840
critical than automatic update do not do

459
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,580
it well why so my best guess at this is

460
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,590
Microsoft does this behavior called

461
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,570
bundling of updates so what they'll do

462
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,889
is they'll release an update and written

463
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,870
up update and then when they hit this

464
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,370
the third update they go well really we

465
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,110
should just put all those those earlier

466
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,699
updates together into one update roll

467
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,760
them together and then just release one

468
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,029
forward and so what I did that the

469
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,440
number of updates or that it's possible

470
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,539
to differentiate this because they do

471
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,600
post the information but it is in a very

472
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,889
hard to parse movement saying and I

473
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,689
didn't want to throw enough undergrads

474
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:00,039
at basically reading through all of

475
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,230
these documents at figuring out which

476
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,240
thing can came to which one but that's

477
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,100
what causes it the other one that you

478
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,159
haven't brought up but you may have

479
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,469
noticed is I cut this graph off this

480
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,679
graph actually heads way the heck up all

481
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,990
the way up into past one year the other

482
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,750
cause for this is that sometimes I don't

483
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,940
need an update right away like this

484
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,220
device when i first plugged it into my

485
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,289
machine installed a driver automatically

486
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,850
and that driver may have had an update

487
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,590
associated with it which i did not need

488
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,330
up until the moment in which i plugged

489
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,399
it into the system and then i suddenly

490
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,799
needed it and so microsoft may have

491
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:37,750
released this two years ago and I just

492
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,039
now installed it and so you have these

493
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,299
long time theories that I haven't

494
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,210
figured out how to remove from the data

495
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,649
set yet mostly were removing them in

496
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,299
this case by just pulling them out

497
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:50,620
because they look like outliers all

498
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,970
right any more questions on this piece

499
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,080
before I kind of start moving into the

500
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,029
survey alright so that was entirely

501
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,199
windows logs when I start talking about

502
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,210
the survey we're going to start mixing

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,679
talking about windows and talking about

504
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,649
some of the applications install the top

505
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,210
of it I've just thrown this up here

506
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:09,039
again in case we'd spent a lot of time

507
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,570
before we don't really need to talk

508
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,450
about it all right so what you're

509
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,939
looking at here is the way people are

510
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,980
answering a survey versus the way our

511
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,600
log file parser determines what their

512
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,360
system is actually doing and the number

513
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,039
the fella teach group so the in the

514
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,978
upper left hand corner for example

515
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,929
is all the participants who all knew

516
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:31,389
that they were being notified before

517
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,489
installation and not if the system

518
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,869
wasn't in automatically installing so

519
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:37,389
they changed it so the system was not

520
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:41,850
doing an automatic installation and they

521
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:45,519
knew that if I color this graph for you

522
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,309
because okay good colors show up the

523
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,220
people in the green boxes are correct

524
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,418
the people in the red boxes are wrong I

525
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,669
want to distinguish between them being

526
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,769
wrong and being in the dangerous state

527
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,559
because that's two different situations

528
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,299
but the four people that change to

529
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,009
notify knew that they change to notify

530
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,779
which is perhaps why we're seeing them

531
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:07,960
updating things fairly quickly they know

532
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:09,970
it's their responsibility I should also

533
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,529
note that there should be two people in

534
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,059
the disabled category but one of them

535
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,979
indicated on the survey that they did

536
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,168
not have windows installed I swear they

537
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:19,090
had windows installed but it caused the

538
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,979
logic and the survey software to not ask

539
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:26,109
them this question which is why they're

540
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:27,609
not here so getting back to so one of

541
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,379
the reasons we're probably seeing the

542
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:31,210
the quick installation by the notifies

543
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:32,408
they know that they have to do this they

544
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,570
are aware that they change their

545
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:37,899
settings what's really interesting

546
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,609
actually is that 20 of our subjects that

547
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:42,279
have it set to automatically install

548
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:44,228
don't think that they think that Windows

549
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,999
asks them but then never automatically

550
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:47,739
installs anything they think it's their

551
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,820
responsibility to do this and when we

552
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,859
interview them we actually get a

553
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:55,299
consistent response here they think that

554
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:58,029
so just to back up two slides if you

555
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:00,399
went and you always took advantage of

556
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,599
that green box so every time it popped

557
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:03,518
up and said you have new updates

558
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,129
available you clicked yes I want to

559
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:10,299
install them you might never learn that

560
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:14,199
there is a red box uh and so a fair

561
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,729
number of our participants felt that

562
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,769
they were notified before an

563
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:20,139
installation but that no automatic

564
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,090
installation was ever done and it's

565
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:24,129
possible that for I haven't tried

566
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,809
pulling this out as much I catch I did

567
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:27,879
pull this out there they're a mixed bag

568
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,470
some of them are actually being having

569
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,658
forced installations happen on their

570
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,879
machines some of them aren't but they

571
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,559
the perception that situation is that

572
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,760
they actually are being asked and the

573
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,550
system is not necessarily

574
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,050
doing it on their behalf verses eight of

575
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,000
our participants that believe that it's

576
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,430
actually there that the system is

577
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,280
automatically forcing this situation so

578
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,650
we're seeing this is I realize not news

579
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,360
most users don't properly necessarily

580
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,590
understand how their systems are

581
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,899
behaving when it comes to software

582
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,720
updates but it is interesting to see

583
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,610
where they are falling and that a large

584
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,380
number of people believe that updating

585
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,389
software is with something that they

586
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,480
personally have to do and that the

587
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:10,390
system may not do for them I I promise

588
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,780
to pick on Java so let's look at the

589
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:16,570
same graph for java java is a little bit

590
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,879
different in that we can't reach in and

591
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,620
figure out what java settings are and at

592
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,600
the time of the study java was not doing

593
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,580
any automatic updates so the fact that

594
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,929
the row of automatic updates in the

595
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,030
survey is completely blank they're

596
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,790
correct there it's not automatically

597
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,139
updating and it's always asking them so

598
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,010
instead of looking at the setting we

599
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,900
looked at whether or not it was

600
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:38,650
currently updated the day at the date

601
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,440
then we ran this survey and broke it out

602
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,450
equivalently on the three people that

603
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,910
think it's not installed and it's not

604
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,580
installed or obviously correct what's

605
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,150
kind of terrifying here though is that

606
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:59,290
out of all of these participants only

607
00:23:52,150 --> 00:24:01,270
nine of them have it updated I mean this

608
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,740
is actually fairly consistent with what

609
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,340
I showed at the beginning of the

610
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,350
presentation people aren't updating Java

611
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,780
they just don't and what's almost more

612
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,379
terrifying is that they know the system

613
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,060
will not update itself if you look at

614
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,480
the survey there's an option here auto

615
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,030
installs updates no one picked it they

616
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,990
all know that the system is asking them

617
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:27,850
to do the installation and that and then

618
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,060
they're not doing it this is a conscious

619
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,709
decision and so this isn't a mistaken of

620
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,649
understanding kind of what's going on

621
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,150
here so of course that leads me into the

622
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,320
next part which is well what happens

623
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,840
when we actually asked them this

624
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,700
question what do you think's going on

625
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,850
here and why are you picking these these

626
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,149
options in order to do this and we don't

627
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,178
necessarily

628
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:51,709
have enough time for me to dig through

629
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,179
all the details of how we did this

630
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,999
analysis but it's called a thematic

631
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,830
analysis we did interviews we went

632
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,089
through the interviews we coded up

633
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,739
particular concepts they're coming out

634
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:02,269
of it I'm going to be talking about

635
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:04,159
several pieces of software the software

636
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,609
i'm mentioning was actually not brought

637
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,379
up by us participants uniformly picked

638
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:11,928
these software's to talk about as a

639
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:13,759
common point of concern or problem and

640
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,039
when I hit certain ones of them will

641
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,539
explain why because sometimes particular

642
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,129
update happened right before our study

643
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,469
which caused the participant to be

644
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:24,199
irritated about that particular one and

645
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:25,879
mention it so the the first theme that

646
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,729
really came out here is this concept was

647
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:31,399
surprised you their interface changes

648
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:33,499
right before our study iTunes decided to

649
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,789
go from there prior interface where they

650
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:39,859
had a sidebar that showed music to a

651
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:41,570
interface that's modal so if you want to

652
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:43,369
go from books to music you have to click

653
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,749
on the thing that says books and then

654
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,809
select the drop-down item that says

655
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:51,440
music one of my subjects describe this

656
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:53,779
is oh my god where'd my music go there

657
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,710
was some distinctive concern about the

658
00:25:53,779 --> 00:26:01,039
the updating behavior here and this is

659
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,629
typify din a quote so I always worry

660
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,399
that everything is going to get screwed

661
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:06,049
up especially for itunes updates or

662
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,728
things like that because they're always

663
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,649
reconfiguring the layout of stuff and

664
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:13,009
I'm like I don't want you to do that

665
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:15,439
just like leave it alone this is

666
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:17,389
actually a really common comment from

667
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,999
participants they're like I have this

668
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:22,279
thing it's working I liked the way it

669
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:24,589
was working and then suddenly you just

670
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,339
changed it on me and I did not like to

671
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:30,769
change 24 of our participants had iTunes

672
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:32,299
installed eight of them had actually

673
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:34,729
some in some way either stopped

674
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,700
responding to the update requests after

675
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:39,320
this or completely disabled and I can't

676
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,820
tell which one it is I can just tell you

677
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,609
the eight of them no longer had an

678
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,580
updated version of itunes so the first

679
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:51,049
question you might ask is who cares its

680
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:53,658
iTunes I mean sure maybe if they're

681
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,309
downloading really evil music mp3 files

682
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,440
off the internet maybe that's a problem

683
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,969
but it means in itunes who cares i

684
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,890
actually had this question personally

685
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:02,240
myself so i went and did some googling

686
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,400
i tunes like who the heck cares about

687
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,480
all the security I found that the the

688
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,570
update before the one that my

689
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,070
participants hated actually patched 162

690
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:14,720
security vulnerabilities including

691
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:17,210
remote code exploits serious stuff and

692
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,890
when you start digging into why it had

693
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,810
that many vulnerabilities you discover

694
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,990
this interesting though perhaps obvious

695
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:26,330
fact which is that iTunes runs a web

696
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,670
browser doesn't just run a web browser

697
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,350
it runs WebKit web kits the thing that

698
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,810
makes chrome run and it's the main thing

699
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,780
that makes Safari run so if you have

700
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,370
written a vulnerability and it works

701
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,100
against chrome or it works against

702
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,800
Safari there's a non-trivial chance of

703
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,750
the work against iTunes and I especially

704
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,450
had my students with Macintoshes attempt

705
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,610
this on websites if you craft a URL

706
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,950
properly it just auto opens a night in

707
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,840
iTunes right like it's an iTunes it

708
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,680
wants to open into the store just pulls

709
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,510
it straight up and so you have that I

710
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,920
really like this example mostly because

711
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:05,870
it's it's not obvious like you wouldn't

712
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,910
normally link iTunes it's a security

713
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,350
problem our subjects definitely didn't

714
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,990
like the guy turns to the security

715
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,520
problem but many pieces of software you

716
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,950
don't normally think of as security

717
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,960
problems on your system can in fact be

718
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,640
this way and it's a situation in which

719
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,430
decisions involving a user interface are

720
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,230
causing security problems these people

721
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,880
completely stopped updating to prevent

722
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,350
this user interface change they will

723
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,940
have security problems in the future

724
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,219
that are caused by the user interface

725
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,710
decisions that are being made and how

726
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,800
things are packaged so moving on to

727
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,830
another one again Java unused and

728
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,960
unrecognized software for those of you

729
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:49,100
don't know what Java is just in case you

730
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,530
don't Java is a pro or a broadly it's a

731
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,179
program that lets other programs run so

732
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,149
there's your computer there's Java

733
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,190
there's your favorite game so your

734
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,050
favorite game sits on top of Java which

735
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,720
since it's on top of the computer if you

736
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:06,409
remove the Java out of the middle your

737
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,680
game stops working this is important

738
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,000
because most people never hit Java when

739
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,200
they click on the something off the

740
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,570
start menu they hit my favorite game

741
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,490
and it's not necessarily evidence the

742
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,290
13th with Java and you can tell this

743
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,710
from the quotes from participants so I

744
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,330
don't know why the hell I need a Java so

745
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,890
I ignore it and I'm pissed off and I

746
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,689
think I have a tendency like when I see

747
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,360
Java pop up in the corner I'm like fu

748
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,050
java get off of my screen why are you

749
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,550
still here I very frustrated participant

750
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,300
on I will note the right before our

751
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,159
study Java had a string of security

752
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,129
vulnerabilities which is not an uncommon

753
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,530
event for java and this caused people to

754
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,160
have to hit you know the ok button or

755
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,899
ignore this Java thing a lot frequently

756
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,700
and so this was we did not actually ask

757
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,980
them explicitly about Java other than

758
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:04,060
the survey but they all mentioned it was

759
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:08,680
like yeah um and yes seventy-four

760
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:10,990
percent were not updated yes I remember

761
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,180
there was a period it seems java will

762
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,860
ask for updating every day even an

763
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,290
update today tomorrow it will show up

764
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,330
again so I actually ended up not not

765
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,760
responding to it so I guess maybe that's

766
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,100
a similar experiment here it's for some

767
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,340
reason just to frequent so I like I

768
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,439
don't know why I haven't actually asked

769
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,600
them is deep suspicion they're not

770
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,460
bundling the updates so you install

771
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,350
update 1 and then you've been ignoring

772
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,300
update 1 for so long there's now update

773
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,129
2 and then by the time you get around to

774
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,350
update to update 3 happens I can tell

775
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,870
you that your experience is not abnormal

776
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,189
I talked to people on airplanes and in

777
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,320
lines and all sorts of things about

778
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,030
their negative update experiences and I

779
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,300
have frequently heard this this opinion

780
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:53,620
like I just hit that button why do I

781
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,820
have to hit the button again is this a

782
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,530
virus is it broken that didn't come back

783
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,389
so much as much in this study but yeah

784
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,000
it definitely happens the other one

785
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,220
though I want to talk about is so if

786
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,920
you're familiar with Java there's kind

787
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,560
of two camps in computer security when

788
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,810
it comes to Java one camp is get that

789
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,970
thing off your machine it's really

790
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,830
dangerous you should uninstall it and

791
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,710
never use anything that involves jobs

792
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,570
this is one camp the other camp believes

793
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,640
you can't get it off your machine it's

794
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,260
needed for too many things you need to

795
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,970
update it and you need up in it quickly

796
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,070
so this

797
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,900
just to describe it one of our

798
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,639
participants was like oh there's all

799
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,770
these Java requests I should figure out

800
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,030
what Java is before I decided you know

801
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,470
should I be hitting this pattern out so

802
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,830
she did the rational thing she googled

803
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,720
it do I want to install the java update

804
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,340
you know some of the forums say you

805
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,530
should install the update because we'll

806
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,810
make it better other forms are like just

807
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,490
take it off your computer completely she

808
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:58,450
hit the end of this and she decided you

809
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:59,860
know that not to touch it because she

810
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,090
doesn't know what to do one half is

811
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,159
telling her to get through this Java

812
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,620
thing the other one is telling her to

813
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,200
hit the buttons like she has a vote for

814
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,419
both buttons what does she do and the

815
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,840
answer is don't do anything you might

816
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,690
damage it and and this is another reason

817
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,110
we're experiencing problems with Jabba

818
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,520
this is why Java is updated so poorly so

819
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,929
moving on to the third one that we

820
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,900
identified out of this research is

821
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:29,620
currently functional software adobe was

822
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,660
a beautiful example of this I also like

823
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,070
to refer this category if it as if it

824
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:41,350
ain't broke don't fix it it's working

825
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:43,210
don't mess with working things I I feel

826
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,860
like if I'm really used to software I'm

827
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,610
using it and I think it's meeting my

828
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,379
needs I won't update the software I just

829
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,360
don't see what an update to adobe reader

830
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:58,510
can do I mean it's PDF files it's

831
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:01,959
viewing them it's he wrong I mean when

832
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:04,629
he hits the PDF file button the PDF

833
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,180
shows up why would I need to do this I

834
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:11,110
nearly inserted this graphic I found

835
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:13,300
online that states on it you know it's

836
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,850
just it's the the logo for a dub ereader

837
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,960
it's like the same program for the last

838
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:22,570
decade needs to update every day this is

839
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,550
a why does it need to update everybody

840
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,700
it's working its functional I don't need

841
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,080
to waste the time on it and and this was

842
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,550
also heavily singh I'll also note that

843
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,899
when we presented the sakai we had

844
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,310
someone come up and explained to us that

845
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,140
they've had to have this conversation

846
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:37,149
with software engineers previously

847
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,390
before because this is not obvious and

848
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,950
the reason that is that many people see

849
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,250
this as you have this document it's

850
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,870
sitting

851
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,610
on your hard drive it's just sitting

852
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,959
there so what's the computer doing it's

853
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:51,100
picking it up off the hard drive and

854
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,930
it's showing it to you so how could this

855
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,149
have anything to do with security right

856
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,310
it's just taking a static thing and it's

857
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,690
showing it to you and that is not what

858
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,040
it's doing right it's doing a lot of

859
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,780
complicated things just like the

860
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,330
Internet has to do some things in order

861
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,020
to show display this concept content to

862
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,850
you also adobe reader has to do

863
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,290
calculations and it allows all sorts of

864
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,850
other things to run to in order to

865
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,730
display something to you so it can

866
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:19,659
actually be serious in dangerous all

867
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,520
right so that is the the work I did at

868
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,560
Michigan State talking primarily about

869
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,050
like just talking with this small set of

870
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,520
users so now the Indiana University

871
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,110
we're starting to try to move some of

872
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,550
this resource forward into new

873
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:35,919
directions and this is so what a might

874
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,409
reside is not finished work it is work

875
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,940
then which we are planning to hit the Go

876
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,950
button on soon but we don't actually

877
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:45,280
have the results of soon so I'm just

878
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,989
dating that up front part of the problem

879
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,669
here is we're looking a small set and we

880
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,259
we can see some of the problems people

881
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,638
are having but we're not really sure how

882
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,100
do you address them or how widespread

883
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,230
they are or even what's out there to

884
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,630
address them right now so what's out

885
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:02,050
there to address them right now is this

886
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,670
right this is like now every time I see

887
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,880
a software update pop up on my computer

888
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,760
I screenshot it it's an automatic

889
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,710
behavior at this stage I have piles of

890
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,210
screenshots of these things some of them

891
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,150
are really good like the one in the

892
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,460
middle here I this update addresses

893
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,230
customer issues and security

894
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,160
vulnerabilities Adobe recommends that

895
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:26,110
you always install the latest updates

896
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:32,290
all right so does this update change my

897
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:34,120
user interface I don't know ah watch I

898
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,770
might know what this software is that's

899
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,240
more likely but there's nothing on this

900
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,740
thing trying to explain to me what the

901
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,839
software is it's not trying to address

902
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,049
that concern and if it ain't broke don't

903
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:47,260
fix it well I don't even understand if I

904
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:49,660
am customer issues and if I don't think

905
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,780
it's broken right now then what customer

906
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,259
issues and this is a common thing so

907
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,190
what I talked about before is strong

908
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,040
things that came out of the research

909
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,720
what this list is is it's a longer set

910
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,580
of things that either came out weekly or

911
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,870
based on other research I think are

912
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,200
things that people are concerned about

913
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:12,089
yeah what happened when your creative

914
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,890
details what kind of detail do yoga

915
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,110
trying to member happen racket it wasn't

916
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:20,490
useful I think it shipped me over to the

917
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:22,830
adobe update webpage mm-hmm I know

918
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,890
though father like Java more information

919
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,509
I do not have the job and more

920
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,490
information is not particularly useful

921
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,630
oh sorry won't let me go back through

922
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,859
them one by one it's probably gonna

923
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,720
bring the back up honestly I think the

924
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,600
most useful one I've ever seen and I

925
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,120
perhaps you have screenshotted here was

926
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,520
Wireshark so if you look at this list

927
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,279
here and you look at a Wireshark update

928
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,970
they actually have a whole document

929
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,920
that's their release notes the on the

930
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,200
outline for the document basically reads

931
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,030
like this list starting with a

932
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,589
description of what's Wireshark which

933
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,000
theoretically you should know if it's on

934
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,200
your machine but they don't just even

935
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,960
assume that they start with a

936
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,279
two-sentence what is Wireshark and in

937
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,040
the bottom left-hand corner they even

938
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,600
have a skip this update option so if you

939
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,279
don't want this update you just hit that

940
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,660
button the next update will show up but

941
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,700
it won't bother you about this one

942
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,230
anymore it's probably one of the more

943
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,330
usable ones I've seen since I've started

944
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,560
screen shopping now admittedly I'm

945
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,600
screen shouting the ones on my machine

946
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,549
and we're looking at trying to do this

947
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,100
more broadly with a with different

948
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,570
groups but let me go through this list

949
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,360
quickly talking about some of the things

950
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,680
that are on it and why they are on it

951
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,330
the first one should be obvious from the

952
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,319
presentation I've done thus far people

953
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,850
are really concerned about whether or

954
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,460
not their user interface will change and

955
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:41,250
many update dialogues do not actually

956
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,480
address this topic which makes it very

957
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,100
difficult for me to tell the difference

958
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,390
between something that's just going to

959
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,549
make some changes underneath that I

960
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,160
don't see it's something that's going to

961
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,990
require me to relearn my entire user

962
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,870
interface or figure out where my music

963
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:57,390
one on the second ones usage and this is

964
00:37:54,870 --> 00:38:00,660
something people brought up a lot was do

965
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:03,330
I use this program java fell straight

966
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,640
into this bucket am i actually using

967
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,560
this because if i'm not using it why am

968
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,640
i spending time updating it why am i

969
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,470
having to up really

970
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,879
boot my computer if I don't actually

971
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,529
need the update it's not going to be

972
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,829
valuable to me why would I waste that

973
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:19,799
time or take that risk and so my

974
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:22,109
personal usage of it actually comes very

975
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:24,569
strongly into this this includes whether

976
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,828
or not i'm using it right now whether or

977
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,269
not trying to update it while at fact

978
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:30,029
impact my ability to can keep doing

979
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:32,669
things the company reputation comes in

980
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:34,920
very strongly what happened last time i

981
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,390
had a lot of people talk about Java

982
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,789
updates and actually a positive manner

983
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,900
they're like oh a java update well when

984
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:41,670
i see one of those i know i'm going to

985
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,200
hit the box nothing on my computer is

986
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,420
going to like freeze up or cause any

987
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,009
problems it's just going to run and if

988
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,950
it asks for a reboot I can just tell it

989
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,390
know when it will respect that and

990
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,279
because of this opinion those people are

991
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,480
updating Java they're like this thing

992
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:56,190
doesn't get in the way it doesn't cost

993
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,710
me any grief that hasn't caused me grief

994
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,660
the last time compare that to the iTunes

995
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,029
quote I gave you earlier in which they

996
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,058
are going ja itunes apple always messes

997
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:08,579
stuff up when i hit that button they're

998
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:10,740
going to screw it up and when they have

999
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,079
that opinion their willingness just

1000
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,180
update things is actually really low I

1001
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,619
talked to Apple users and their odds of

1002
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,839
telling me that they're going to

1003
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:20,309
research an update is a whole lot higher

1004
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,078
than when i talk to Windows users

1005
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:23,460
they're suspicious they actually go out

1006
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,529
there and look just figure out what this

1007
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,730
update is going to do because Apple

1008
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:32,099
might screw it up um computing resources

1009
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,390
also a major issue if you're an Apple

1010
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,029
user particularly if you're an apple

1011
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,680
phone user they actually I talked to

1012
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:38,970
ones all the time they won't install the

1013
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,259
updates because the updates will

1014
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,328
increase the size of the operating

1015
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:43,710
system and will take away to space on

1016
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,690
their hard drives of their phones and

1017
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,490
they need all the space or they may not

1018
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,779
even have enough space to pull down the

1019
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:53,250
update this is a serious concern when I

1020
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:54,990
was on the interview circuit I remember

1021
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,119
someone actually showing me two versions

1022
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,640
of Lightroom like it's Lightroom isn't

1023
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,190
it that they use running simultaneously

1024
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,019
because the new version apparently isn't

1025
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,390
memory efficient enough to handle the

1026
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,490
file sizes the old version was running

1027
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,250
and so he had to keep the old version

1028
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:15,118
around just because it couldn't handle

1029
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:17,809
or manage memory properly so resources

1030
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,009
are actually a major issue features

1031
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,990
apple maybe I should have said I was

1032
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:24,170
going to pick on Apple

1033
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,000
um i have another quote from an apple

1034
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,280
participant who basically said that well

1035
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,780
you know the old apple devices sometimes

1036
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,840
you just can't use them with the new

1037
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,670
versions of itunes I actually talked to

1038
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,060
a tech journalists once who is like I

1039
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,500
have the virus ridden computer in which

1040
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,720
that was in quotes by the way through ur

1041
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,330
doing virus written computer that i have

1042
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,339
for updating my old ipod because i can't

1043
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,350
install any new versions on it because

1044
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,750
if i do it'll no longer work with my old

1045
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,279
ipod and so sometimes be sure show up

1046
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,660
which is a really positive thing so like

1047
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,890
some people are updating itunes because

1048
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,750
they needed to work with their new phone

1049
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,339
or because it had new new bell or

1050
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,140
whistled that they really liked some

1051
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,580
people were blocking updates because

1052
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,859
they thought they would stop working

1053
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,230
with an older file format or if they

1054
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:09,380
would they lose the ability to interact

1055
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:11,660
with a particular device monetary costs

1056
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,910
come came up in some cat sometimes

1057
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,770
though its most updates today are

1058
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,540
typically free but sometimes they're not

1059
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:21,710
so particularly an upgrade so if I'm

1060
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:23,869
moving from Windows say XP up to Windows

1061
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:27,609
8 that will cost me money and that might

1062
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:30,410
make a serious decision point um

1063
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:32,540
compatibility this came up actually in

1064
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,000
reference to browsers more you've got

1065
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,520
all these plugins and when the browser

1066
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,310
rolls forward some percentage of them

1067
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,920
just stopped working and if that was a

1068
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,869
really valuable plug-in to me I will

1069
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,940
block this update and I don't know if

1070
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,230
that will happen or not a beautiful

1071
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,540
example of this is actually screen

1072
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,700
readers I was talking with a blind user

1073
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,500
who had every update on her automatic

1074
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,500
update on her entire machine turned off

1075
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,940
because if one thing updated and

1076
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,119
disabled the screen reader she would

1077
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,260
lose the ability to even fix the problem

1078
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,700
because she couldn't see it so unless

1079
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,230
something was approved as working with

1080
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,859
her screen readers she would not move

1081
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,750
anything forward everything was blocked

1082
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,700
and that I can't tell her she's wrong

1083
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,670
like she's making a very rational

1084
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,169
decision security is an interesting one

1085
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,540
on here because I keep wanting to add it

1086
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,270
and my participants don't keep not

1087
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,980
adding it but the way that they do talk

1088
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,350
about security is whether or not

1089
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,630
something is a security related software

1090
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,368
so people will talk a lot about updating

1091
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,230
their antivirus they will update their

1092
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:34,820
antivirus this is important for security

1093
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:38,570
they will update their browser

1094
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,670
bad things coming off the internet they

1095
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,950
don't update iTunes what the heck does

1096
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,360
that have to do with security so

1097
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,669
something is perceived as being

1098
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,920
security-related they are more likely to

1099
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,590
update it because of that but they won't

1100
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,420
necessarily update these other things

1101
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:56,030
that might be security-related or they

1102
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,030
might not believe it we had one

1103
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:01,430
participant it expressed that um well

1104
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,200
okay Matt we told them will imagine that

1105
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,390
this the softer told you this was an

1106
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,859
urgent security update and his

1107
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:12,020
responsible how does the computer know

1108
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,250
it's urgent and if we have lack of trust

1109
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,259
in some of these machines i mean like

1110
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,970
how does this person who's sitting all

1111
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,550
the way over in Microsoft know what's

1112
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,080
best for my machine I am the one sitting

1113
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,060
in front of this I get to decide whether

1114
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,020
or not something is surging and so

1115
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,270
there's sometimes a lack of belief

1116
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,470
there's also a lot of opinions about

1117
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:33,170
bugs so issues involving that I think

1118
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:35,779
I'm probably running low on time someone

1119
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,190
want to tell me I actually don't know

1120
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:42,380
when this ends so the clock in front of

1121
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:45,700
me is not helpful okay is that before I

1122
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,700
didn't start getting questions or shy

1123
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:53,390
okay i will skip through this then i

1124
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,770
just wanted to kind of point out that

1125
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,540
there is a second round to this is

1126
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,590
reasons people won't install and then

1127
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,360
there's reasons people won't install

1128
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,830
right now this is kind of different the

1129
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,330
two difference i've talked about earlier

1130
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,250
right are people installing updates at

1131
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,990
all and why are people installing

1132
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,180
updates necessarily right now and they

1133
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,700
are different lists there's a lot of

1134
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,339
similarities but a lot of them have to

1135
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,839
do with things like budgeting time in

1136
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,840
case one of those other things happens

1137
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,760
so if I might not hit the Update button

1138
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,200
right now on itunes I might wait to the

1139
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,910
weekend when I know I have time to

1140
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,009
relearn the user interface if it causes

1141
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,750
that problem and if I know the user

1142
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,480
interface not right not isn't going to

1143
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,190
change maybe I will go and make that

1144
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,810
decision maybe I'll do the update now

1145
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,820
but if I have that risk I have to budget

1146
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:37,160
for it and there's a lot of elements

1147
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,080
active budget for like reboots can I go

1148
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,980
back different sorts of things that

1149
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,810
control whether or not i'm updating

1150
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,580
right down i'm just going to skip

1151
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,290
through the minor point i had there and

1152
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,029
we'll skip to questions we still have

1153
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:51,660
time for it so thank you very much

1154
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:54,720
I have questions have you done any

1155
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,990
research on these windows which comes up

1156
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,970
and they ask you this version that you

1157
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,979
are using is kind of odd would you like

1158
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,930
to update and are usually very

1159
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,000
apprehensive to do that because

1160
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,919
sometimes i'm suspicious they're putting

1161
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,290
something in that they can get in later

1162
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,360
on so i have to go to the original

1163
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,670
website to do it have you done any

1164
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,710
research on that i haven't but i really

1165
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,180
do want to this is kind of those spaces

1166
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,730
we're moving into so we're trying to

1167
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,560
look at two things moving forward 1 i'm

1168
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,690
trying to do in a survey in which we

1169
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,100
elicit experiences from users just

1170
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,200
trying to get a broader sense of what's

1171
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,580
going on the other one in which i want

1172
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,439
to take a couple of these screenshots

1173
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,390
like the ones I showed you here and just

1174
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,370
put them up in front of users in a

1175
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,230
survey format and ask them ask them a

1176
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,720
pile of questions like do you think this

1177
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,670
is valid or do you think this is a real

1178
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,500
one do you think this is going to change

1179
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,590
yours or interface like going down a lot

1180
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,090
of elements of that list I can tell you

1181
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,370
from not necessarily software updates

1182
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,900
but just in very general users have a

1183
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,120
lot of trouble differentiating between

1184
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,610
like that pop up that came off the

1185
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,490
internet and this incredibly important

1186
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:01,170
security dialogue if you don't have a

1187
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,069
lot of experience is difficult to tell

1188
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,450
the difference between something

1189
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,490
blinking and telling you who you have a

1190
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,660
virus online blinking is starting to

1191
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,790
become something that they've learned to

1192
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,350
avoid but just something popping up on

1193
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,790
line that says you have a problem and

1194
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,069
something popping up in your computer

1195
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,770
can be very different so something I've

1196
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,600
specifically done but it is reasonably

1197
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:22,920
well known at this point in the field

1198
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,049
and yeah it's also particulars at this

1199
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,840
domain many times you're dealing with

1200
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:31,200
security the the answer is to have the

1201
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,750
operating system show you the the

1202
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,609
request but many of these dialogues are

1203
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,440
actually designed by each individual

1204
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,480
system one of the things I would really

1205
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,190
like to move into and hopefully we'll

1206
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,410
start doing is looking at mobile devices

1207
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,630
and whether or not using things like the

1208
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,399
app stores is actually improving some of

1209
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,530
the issues you're talking about because

1210
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,600
now you have an authoritative source

1211
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:55,100
from which you can get the update

1212
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,100
information you don't have to guess

1213
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:05,680
if I was all four others included office

1214
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,180
maybe in some kind of nice ones that can

1215
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,500
or something that if your evenings are

1216
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,069
gonna wear out there was something

1217
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,300
automatically stop those things haven't

1218
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,090
you will help you there over the wall

1219
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,980
coming so it's a mixed Samantha sweet

1220
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,960
this is not the focus of the study so I

1221
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,610
only know it tangentially when we

1222
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,170
identified an issue like that we tried

1223
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,260
to make sure the participant knew before

1224
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,000
they left they may have totally ignore

1225
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,100
us one of the people that turn off his

1226
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,750
firewall did so because it was

1227
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,480
interviewing with some older game they

1228
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:39,250
like to play and so he just disabled the

1229
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,110
firewall antivirus is a couple of our

1230
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,080
participants were actually on Macs in

1231
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,360
which they had installed a vm and so I

1232
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:49,080
would get this tone from them that

1233
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:52,600
they're on a Mac they're fine and

1234
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,310
they're not fine a vm is like they were

1235
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,560
running an actual Windows computer

1236
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,640
there's there's no strong

1237
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,590
differentiation between because it's on

1238
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,170
a Mac or it's on an actual Windows

1239
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:05,620
machine but they didn't have that

1240
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,690
opinion they were on a Mac similar

1241
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,950
opinion might be that i'm on a mac and i

1242
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,690
don't really have anything important in

1243
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,240
here all i'm using this for is running

1244
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:17,920
the you know spss you know stuff with my

1245
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:20,350
research in it ah but sometimes that and

1246
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,060
i also have had several participants

1247
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,310
tell me that they don't go too dangerous

1248
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,100
parts of the internet and because of

1249
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,840
that they don't feel like they or that

1250
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,299
they can differentiate between dangerous

1251
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,370
and non dangerous things and so it's a

1252
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,020
range of i've also had security

1253
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,609
researchers previously tell me that

1254
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,100
antivirus is actually don't do that much

1255
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,930
which i have an entire opinion on that

1256
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,310
topic they're not necessarily wrong but

1257
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,069
it's only because so many people install

1258
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:47,650
antivirus is that it's not worth making

1259
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,210
viruses as many much nowadays and if

1260
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,950
everybody had that opinion we'd probably

1261
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,490
see a resurgence and the amount of virus

1262
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,490
is used

1263
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:01,880
but have a comment following which a

1264
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,830
question you're talking about Java

1265
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,580
earlier that you know Java is probably

1266
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,840
one of the most widely unpatched

1267
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,240
application that you think about but

1268
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,030
isn't it justified that you know because

1269
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,799
Java is one of the largest used

1270
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:17,690
languages for web right now and it's

1271
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,760
used on all the most largest number of

1272
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,160
production machines patching is a bit

1273
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,530
difficult with Java so having said that

1274
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,690
have you looked at standardized data

1275
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:29,150
with Java and that's a windows update or

1276
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:30,650
adobe updates have you sign it as it and

1277
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,140
seen how much of a difference it is I

1278
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:36,260
know but that's because I kind of have

1279
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,900
the wrong data set what's going on here

1280
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,310
is so first off there's end-users

1281
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,630
machines there's typically what I've

1282
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,609
been showing out here which are not

1283
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,590
production machines and typically the

1284
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:46,970
most valuable Java related thing they're

1285
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,950
running is either something from their

1286
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:52,490
company or that game that they really

1287
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:54,140
care about and both of those are equally

1288
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,118
you know internally valuable to someone

1289
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,440
so I don't think that's really

1290
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,270
necessarily what you're concerned with a

1291
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,540
more interesting statistic is the

1292
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:05,450
heartbleed one or the one for a PHP

1293
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:07,279
someone did a survey on that actually if

1294
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,098
you look that one out they have a lot of

1295
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,960
different languages and what whether or

1296
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:14,119
not they're patched on servers they

1297
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,880
found eighty percent of servers running

1298
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:20,359
a version of PHP with a known security

1299
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,060
vulnerability this is a this is a

1300
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,799
problem and we don't it's not just Java

1301
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,560
Java is the easiest one to pick on in

1302
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,290
many regards but like adobe reader adobe

1303
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,549
flash both of those have benefited by

1304
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,790
the fact that the web browsers have

1305
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,339
started bundling them so if you have an

1306
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:39,320
automatic update in chrome or firefox

1307
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:42,470
you have an automatic update of flash as

1308
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,089
it's used i also want to just in case

1309
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,149
here in the audience and you don't know

1310
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:48,920
the difference java is not JavaScript

1311
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,300
Java is very rarely used on the internet

1312
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,400
anymore it's actually primarily

1313
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,880
JavaScript which does beat out Java on

1314
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,310
that list typically Java is for for

1315
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,820
local machine issues all right there was

1316
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,820
an hour question

1317
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:09,310
and they did some encryption algorithm

1318
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,589
within the software so like most of the

1319
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,599
software's that use Java for encryption

1320
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:16,000
purpose it would not function in Java

1321
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:19,630
update it is that one of the reasons to

1322
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,099
consider also it's actually just

1323
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:23,859
slightly different so a question I got

1324
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:25,480
from a prior audience was about these

1325
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:27,609
emails they would get all the time from

1326
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,730
their IT department and the email is

1327
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:33,490
like update Adobe right now don't update

1328
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,560
Adobe right now do update java right now

1329
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:40,839
don't update java this version do you

1330
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:42,430
update this one I and you get I don't

1331
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,619
know entirely the answer to that I

1332
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,140
suspect that fatigue about hitting these

1333
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:50,470
stupid buttons and not knowing what Java

1334
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,299
where are much larger reasons but

1335
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,919
there's also the secondary level of

1336
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,480
input people are getting from IT

1337
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,310
departments it from other groups that

1338
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,040
are trying to manage software

1339
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,210
compatibility within organizations and I

1340
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,390
don't know how much people are learning

1341
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,740
from that and neither taking it home or

1342
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:09,609
learning from that not to touch this

1343
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:11,080
thing both of it both lessons I think

1344
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:13,359
might be contributing to something like

1345
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,609
this and causing that sort of trouble

1346
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:20,049
the other thing I'll notice there's an I

1347
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:21,609
haven't gotten into the economics of

1348
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,220
this sort of a situation but there is a

1349
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:26,290
lot of interesting economics if

1350
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,060
everything is updating very rarely do

1351
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,550
you write software that is the entire

1352
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,310
stack nowadays typically you don't want

1353
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:35,800
to reinvent the wheel you use a library

1354
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:38,049
so you pull down libraries ABCD all the

1355
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,420
way through Z and you use all of them in

1356
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:43,089
your software if a single one of them

1357
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,040
changes single one updates and isn't

1358
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:48,940
compatible your entire software breaks

1359
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,490
and when all of them are updating on

1360
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,690
these tight update cycles the odds that

1361
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:55,000
one of them is going to scrub your

1362
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,760
software actually gets really high and

1363
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,020
how much effort are you you're willing

1364
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,250
to put out particular when we start

1365
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,690
dealing with these situations in which

1366
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,980
we have a lot of developers that are

1367
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,290
developing for free they're doing

1368
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,089
open-source development now how much

1369
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,609
like maybe I wrote the most awesome

1370
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:12,310
widget effort for Firefox but I did it

1371
00:53:09,609 --> 00:53:14,680
back in firefox 3 odds are my most

1372
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,750
awesome widget no longer work

1373
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,660
and I don't know what Firefox number

1374
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,550
we're at now but it's a large one and

1375
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,230
even if I fix it today the odds are

1376
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,720
Firefox are going to mildly change their

1377
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:29,050
their API and it will be broken tomorrow

1378
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,000
and so I am partially curious how much

1379
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:33,670
this updating this continual source of

1380
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,200
change is causing a negative effect not

1381
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,330
just for end-users and security and

1382
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,430
updating but also for security of like

1383
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,600
things like servers and all of these

1384
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:42,250
other sorts of elements which are

1385
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,589
specifically not updating their

1386
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,430
libraries because updating their

1387
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:49,630
libraries is so much work and one of the

1388
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,490
things I would really like to see happen

1389
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,870
in which I'm kind of working towards

1390
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,569
with these questions is trying to figure

1391
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,980
it out if you were to decide whether or

1392
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,900
not you wanted to update a library what

1393
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,090
are the most important facts to know and

1394
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,760
how can we get the developer who made

1395
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,110
that update to answer them and can they

1396
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,280
answer them easily right if you make it

1397
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,620
too hard for them they're not going to

1398
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,150
answer them but if you can find easy

1399
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,250
questions they can't answer that will

1400
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,900
actually help facilitate this transition

1401
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,760
to differentiate between update that is

1402
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,350
likely to break your stuff and update

1403
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,900
this is not likely to break your stuff

1404
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,980
the odds of getting the they'll not

1405
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,110
going to break your stuff updates

1406
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,110
installed like I hope will improve
