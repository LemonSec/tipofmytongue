1
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,269
good afternoon welcome to the serious

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,820
security seminar it's my great pleasure

3
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,059
to introduce today's speaker dr. Ching

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,520
Ming Oh dr. o is a associate professor

5
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,500
of computer science and Peggy and

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
Garrett Edward cheering engineering at

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,300
Kansas State University he received his

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,379
PhD from Princeton University in 2005

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,780
and between 2005-2006 he was a postdoc

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,309
here with Professor it is a Pertino and

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,590
me and today he will talk about security

12
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,239
analytics well thank you very much you

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,850
know waiting for the introduction it's a

14
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,640
great pleasure to be back to Purdue and

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,010
it's really great to see all of you here

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,260
thank you for coming and I really like

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,140
really appreciate this opportunity to

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,049
talk about my past about eight and a

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,200
half years work understanding of how

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,420
security Allen is to do their jobs how

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,299
that actually lead us to a new product

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,549
like just connecting now bringing an

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,020
anthropology into cyber security so you

24
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,590
may fear this a little weird why and

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,600
sipar just anything to do with security

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,159
but if you know security is essentially

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,829
a human problem that is sort of not very

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,070
surprising so just give you a sort of

29
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,380
like a very illustrative illustration on

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,699
what I've been trying to do over those a

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,520
half years so my research focus has been

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,350
and still are you know how to help this

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,408
poor guy right so if you have any chance

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,329
of not managing a computer system trying

35
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,110
to understand what's going on or

36
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,360
diagnose no force or you know diagnosing

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,219
you know potential breaches you know

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,310
it's a huge challenge and there are so

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,739
many devices there are so many sources

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,800
of information that may be useful for

41
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,070
you to understand what's really doing

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,980
and you have to put all of this into

43
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,560
your head and understand their semantics

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,600
and find the connections between the

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,940
events to make a determination and

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,160
that's an extreme challenge for a human

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,590
to do is touch because a lot of tasks

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,900
are repetitive mundane e are now

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,290
interesting but at the same time they're

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,140
also extremely require a lot of high

51
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,690
expertise in both security and system

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,809
and networking so it's now it's both

53
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:48,170
boring and interesting so my research

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,880
goal at the very beginning was to see if

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,790
I can save this guy but actually

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,680
replacing him by a reasoning system so

57
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,410
that's all I can just press button it

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,280
can find all the security issues in your

59
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:05,720
system and report them as high accurate

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,670
highly accurate alert now that vision

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,230
has shipped over the years and now I

62
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,260
think the world of the problem how to

63
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,060
make the job more more meaningful more

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,060
effective but the human is also always

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,730
going to be part of the system like if

66
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,780
you think about it you know defending a

67
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,119
network is essentially one human playing

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,890
a game with the other so I don't think

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,780
we've ever reached a stage in the

70
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,019
foreseeable future for a computer

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,790
program to complete it to the top right

72
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,310
so the particular port haven't tried to

73
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,410
take over those ears is actually in some

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,380
sense now traditional because we we

75
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,150
really want to make sure our solutions

76
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,769
are actually mapping to the real world

77
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:51,290
so to that end we will will adopt an

78
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,620
empirical approach in a bottom-up

79
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:57,290
fashion what that means is we start with

80
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,540
the incident analysis I will talk to

81
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,640
security analysts who handle security

82
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,100
incidents understand what happened how

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,809
he found out the breaches was the

84
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,150
thought process he went through to

85
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,640
identify them and we got hold of data

86
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,170
that week but when we can to look at the

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,869
data and see if you can find something

88
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,789
then used for there and most important

89
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,560
we want to understand what are the needs

90
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,859
of the human enemies and that's not

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,960
always obvious and a lot of the my

92
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,539
effort has been trying to bridge the gap

93
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,140
between what we are good at

94
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,090
in the university like the theory

95
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:35,210
mathematical models with the practical

96
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,340
needs of security analysts and it turns

97
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,039
out that if there's a huge human

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,030
dimension in this work and in particular

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,430
a lot of times if you ask an analyst

100
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,799
you know how to how do how do you do

101
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,700
your job they cannot really give you a

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,100
straight answer

103
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,099
by the way it's hard for them to explain

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,940
the processes that they take to solve a

105
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,010
case and there's actually a well-known

106
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,230
terminology in an apology to describe

107
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,170
that score tacit knowledge and when we

108
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,990
we all have it we all do a lot of things

109
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,080
but we are not always able to clearly

110
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,720
articulate how we do it now if I take an

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,300
example as know working with my students

112
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,850
advising to teach the person how to do

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,560
research now it's not always easy to

114
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,590
actually explain to someone how to do

115
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,280
research but somehow I can still teach

116
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,130
it I said no what's the deal here

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,679
Michael Polanyi who is a science

118
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,870
philosopher had a saying that we can

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,600
know more than we can tell and that's

120
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,030
actually the sense of tacit knowledge so

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,840
in some sense a lot of my time is spent

122
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,020
on how to convert tacit knowledge into a

123
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,390
more explicit form so you can actually

124
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:53,359
model it and then know producing

125
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,640
algorithms to help human self solve

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,070
those issues so let me give you a

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,880
concrete example to show why this could

128
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,890
be challenging for security quite a few

129
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,260
years ago when I started this work I was

130
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,750
talking with one of our secret others on

131
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,900
campus network he is a he's a friend of

132
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,600
mine and he is such a special case for

133
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,679
analysts because he is both good at his

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,830
work also

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,020
he loves to explain what he does at his

136
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,940
work and this is not a very euro

137
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,380
conversation was and they are so busy

138
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,820
they don't even have time to talk to you

139
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,460
about it but he really loves talking to

140
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,349
people how he solved the case so what

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,719
happened around that time was that you

142
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,180
know one of the days there was a very

143
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,040
very severe that's working issue on

144
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,940
campus network so nobody could go

145
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,820
anywhere

146
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,250
essentially the whole network no no

147
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,969
grinding down to it to a hot so there's

148
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,500
a lot of traffic coming down and that

149
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,870
definitely raised an alert for the

150
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,180
analyst so what he did was to look at

151
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,920
net the net flow down which I'm sure you

152
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,990
all know what that means I just see who

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,090
are talking to to whom my from the

154
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,940
campus network to the outside world what

155
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,909
he found out was some of the servers I

156
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,530
have city stifle antivirus servers they

157
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,580
were communicating with some known

158
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,950
botnet IP addresses right so why why do

159
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,919
those servers to those things that are

160
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:19,729
clear but is highly suspicious and now

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,830
what he did was to know did a memory

162
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,350
dump on one of those servers and see

163
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,380
what was really going on and what he

164
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,150
found out was there are some unknown

165
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,090
code modules in the operating system

166
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,950
that was sort of suspicious he didn't

167
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,919
know why these these modules what they

168
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,650
are they're not that there are not known

169
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,050
modules and he also found IRC

170
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,260
connections between the server and other

171
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,770
similar servers on a campus network so

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,230
with all of this he concluded no these

173
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,419
servers were compromised and powered by

174
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,550
by the part and then they took them

175
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,830
offline

176
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,070
so that's what he told us now what we

177
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,050
really wanted to know is the why so this

178
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,680
is what he did but if you ever want to

179
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,060
know design a method to automate this or

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,980
help the human to do the job that we

181
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,310
need to know how he he moved from one

182
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,919
point to the other but then he didn't

183
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,560
return us to rushing up behind so took

184
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,140
us about a couple hours to sort of

185
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,680
interrogate him to dig into his thinking

186
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,479
to let us know why he can move from one

187
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,150
place to the other and how was a

188
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,550
probable to model it and by the way it

189
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,909
took him about four or five hours to

190
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:38,770
actually reach that conclusion and you

191
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:45,110
realize make that no pace faster oh

192
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:48,470
sorry about that so after this you know

193
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,380
long hours of conversation what we found

194
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,150
some funk found out is the

195
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,920
which mother this is probably something

196
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,819
like this if you think about this out

197
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,339
loud as a human brain and what the

198
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,260
coming at us is those events might have

199
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,250
ideas or lures you have NetFlow Tom

200
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:10,250
syslog all of those so what happens is

201
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,980
when you'll see those observable events

202
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,680
you think what what do they mean

203
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,100
so you actually map those observations

204
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,199
to some semantics in your mind right and

205
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,990
then these little dots are those

206
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,120
hypotheses that you start to form about

207
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,390
what you see now these two are not

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,970
always you know concretely clientís what

209
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,280
that means is what one man could have

210
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,640
multiple interpretations you're not

211
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,560
always sure whether it's the truth

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,199
there's some form of some shade of

213
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,079
uncertainty in that kind of mapping and

214
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,850
but then what you can do is okay now you

215
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,010
have one high post you can think about

216
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,590
what that could mean in terms of what I

217
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,390
can lead to or what can cause that so

218
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,360
you have some thinking going on in your

219
00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:00,530
head and that can be hopefully modeled

220
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,650
in in some way and then I as you think

221
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,410
we are going to need more data to either

222
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,470
help you move like progress to confirm

223
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,530
the hypothesis or with your tip right

224
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,740
this will keep going and you don't stop

225
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:19,069
unless you're satisfied with my but your

226
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,800
conclusion a lot of times what you can

227
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,170
draw very beginning is very very shady

228
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,750
is very uncertain but you really want to

229
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,760
reach a high confidence conclusion at

230
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,920
some point and then you'll stop say hi

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,990
based on all the evidence and my

232
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,500
thinking and this is what happened and

233
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,810
here's the evidence so we want to see

234
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,540
how this can be modeled in this way and

235
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,819
that's actually correspond to how the

236
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,640
analyst thought and that's very

237
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,460
important for us because if our model is

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,160
a lot with the real no human workflow

239
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,600
then we'll have a better chance of

240
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,000
having our research prototype being

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,330
actually used by the humans if this

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,670
mapping actually exists so just give you

243
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,980
a really quick overview on how we model

244
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,329
it we have

245
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,089
observations and this is what you can

246
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,519
see but it's not always telling it what

247
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,199
you want to know which is the high

248
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,620
hypothesis but it can give yourself some

249
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:17,949
crew right so for example if you have a

250
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,019
seer another high traffic on the network

251
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,849
what that could mean somebody's doing

252
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,320
something bad on your network so you can

253
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,779
use a predicate like a type of net

254
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,550
activity to denote certain meaning that

255
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,560
you care about even though there are

256
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,680
zillions of different types of events

257
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,040
you can gather from a network most cases

258
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,529
we have posited you care about is

259
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,969
probably only like a dozen I don't have

260
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,130
a lot of things you want to think about

261
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,110
now you probably think about the machine

262
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,389
is compromised or not or is this a

263
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,570
reconnaissance or this is an exploit

264
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:52,300
those kind of things so we can use a few

265
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,790
predicates to describe those hypotheses

266
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,969
and we try to map different types of

267
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,219
events to those hypotheses now because

268
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,170
of the nature of interpreting the events

269
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,810
there's always uncertainty associated

270
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,910
with those mapping and different events

271
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,888
will have different weights in terms of

272
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,350
how certain you are about those right

273
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,389
hand side and that's important to

274
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,660
capture because in a reasoning me to

275
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,760
close ways together to so see how

276
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,279
certain we are in the final conclusion

277
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,860
so we have to really have a first cut

278
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,300
model now we did not really know what's

279
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,430
the best way to model is because humans

280
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,729
don't didn't really use numbers in in

281
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,500
our head somehow have a hunch feeling so

282
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,440
we just use a human language that are

283
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,010
commonly found in certain data sources

284
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,639
like no intrusion detection no signature

285
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:45,399
files you can use things like possible

286
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,310
likely certain sort of tells you know

287
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,829
how important this alert to be and now

288
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,529
we just use that in our rule without

289
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:56,019
further interpreting it using number but

290
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,610
this can this will come later so

291
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,740
different rules may have a hot and

292
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,079
different levels of certainty and these

293
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,380
can be captured in this very very ad hoc

294
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,410
way I would say now we also have those

295
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,779
brain model right well the capture the

296
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,250
thinking process is a very tiny part of

297
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,769
human thinking but we want to capture

298
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,259
what actually matters for security

299
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,749
analysis

300
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,479
a few rules of our internal model which

301
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:24,929
capture try to capture human reasoning

302
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:28,410
so we have hypothesis one in four houses

303
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:31,228
- and this is again a logical rule with

304
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,459
uncertainty i I can give you a few

305
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:35,220
examples here

306
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:38,549
so if emotion h1 is compromised by an

307
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,319
attacker then you can derive this

308
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:43,228
machine can be used for further

309
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,759
reconnaissance into your network so you

310
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:47,249
can have a predicate is a probe other

311
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:50,609
machine to mean this is you're using a

312
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:53,100
strand as a vantage point to perform

313
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:56,069
reconnaissance into another machine h2

314
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,419
and then it's only a possibility here

315
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:01,289
since we don't really know what the type

316
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:04,559
of choice is he or she may choose to do

317
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:09,059
this or me not so it's only a

318
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:12,108
possibility on the other hand I guess

319
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:15,618
how do I disable is what I just connect

320
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:15,619
yeah that's good idea

321
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,270
thank you

322
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,989
on the other hand if you have a

323
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,050
hypothesis like h1 is you to send an

324
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,390
expert to page 2 right and then we will

325
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,990
say likely h2 will be compromised or for

326
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,430
the reason that attackers normally for

327
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,350
good attackers you don't want Brandon

328
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,349
sign something which may not work you

329
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,940
test it beforehand make sure you set up

330
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,550
all the parameters right based on the

331
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,550
reconnaissance so I understand a real

332
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,760
exploit with higher chance it actually

333
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:00,250
will get targeted to see likely h2 will

334
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,160
be compromised these are I some sense

335
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,110
I'm trying to codify poor part of the

336
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,660
human knowledge used in those analytic

337
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,760
work and then these are all logical

338
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,939
rules and once you have the rules and

339
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,420
you can imagine even this apply very

340
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,100
straightforward logical reasoning I

341
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,430
applying the rules on the facts and so

342
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,470
we have the facts for example the number

343
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,699
dumb show they are true there are IRC

344
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,770
connection between those two IP

345
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,960
addresses and then found this fact we

346
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,000
can see the first rules left hand side

347
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,950
is match so you can fire this rule

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,100
instantiate the variables with concrete

349
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,360
values and you can derive one more fact

350
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,610
which is the right hand side of the room

351
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,220
now every fact will also have a

352
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,680
certainty tax associated with it because

353
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:52,890
the rule has a type of likely we just

354
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,890
put likely here as a tag of the fact yes

355
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:05,339
so these rules are actually generic and

356
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,529
this hook was captured the human

357
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:11,160
knowledge use in analyzing different

358
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:15,869
types of scenarios and at least as

359
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,868
that's our you know objective so we you

360
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:20,399
know it's we don't really want to have a

361
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:22,259
different set of rules but new event we

362
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,850
then that would defeat the purpose of

363
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:32,610
having a system to help you find new

364
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:34,439
you're taxed under these rules is what

365
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,290
we call an observation correspond

366
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:39,238
wellness it can be defined based on a

367
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,079
specific types of events we want to

368
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:46,410
capture so these are actually event

369
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:56,420
specific but it's not scenario specific

370
00:16:46,410 --> 00:17:00,238
so you've got sort of the user can

371
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:03,628
presumably know can't you know calculate

372
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:05,339
those rules if no one is believed it

373
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,589
could be something different or you

374
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,589
could actually change the the tags in

375
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:14,480
certain ways yeah I think that's a valid

376
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,480
way of using those those rules

377
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,010
right right and another point is there

378
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,200
may be different contexts that may be

379
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,010
relevant in second those parameters yeah

380
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,080
that's a very good point so now you have

381
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,379
those derivations and the can keep going

382
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,540
or have it one new fact I can mash this

383
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,500
second true which we have in the system

384
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:44,310
that keeps going but now we have to take

385
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,560
the roost modality and can consider

386
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,440
we're starting with a likely fact so

387
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,840
even though the rule is certain mode we

388
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,530
only take the less and so you still have

389
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,870
likely you know in the conclusion so

390
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,870
just do this you know mechanically you

391
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,719
can actually perform this in a deductive

392
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,479
database and then you can actually

393
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,060
perform this analysis very efficiently

394
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,660
the shift of the ruler we tell we used

395
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,389
to always have

396
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,560
Owen Square capacity but any number of

397
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:18,240
different IP addresses in the logs now

398
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,669
normally why you try to you know prove

399
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,760
something or try to do the derivation if

400
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,040
I can tell why a fact that means oh then

401
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,170
that's good enough because I find an

402
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,260
evidential path to this particular

403
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,960
hypothesis however the cost of the

404
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,390
uncertainty in those facts you also know

405
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,140
all the structure of possible derivation

406
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,330
so you need an exhaustive proof sir

407
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,310
so not just one well all the possible

408
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,399
way to prove this have posit that can

409
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,679
also be done in the same capacity as

410
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,480
finding a single food so that's

411
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,000
something with leverage from my past

412
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,950
work and then you have the proof graph

413
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,440
which shows you all the possible ways to

414
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,040
prove a hypothesis and use the cras

415
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,770
structure to calculate what to infer how

416
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,470
certain certain hypothesis ways could be

417
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,270
now in this example you have two

418
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,850
corroborating average path between the

419
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,220
same hypothesis you can strengthen the

420
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,399
belief because I have two independent

421
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,490
ways to to show me this machine is

422
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,010
compromised so maybe we can strengthen

423
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:27,540
them into certain very ad hoc right so

424
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,330
here is where with okay now it's the

425
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,050
time for it to sort of reflect what what

426
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,470
we do

427
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,480
if this really makes sense then make a

428
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,610
really meaningful with your order is the

429
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,830
way we can interpret the process of

430
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,379
strengthening now what if you have no

431
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,409
one likely when possible or three

432
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,730
possible there are so many different you

433
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,190
cannot just have this I'd have rules

434
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,100
like like this now is the time we should

435
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,790
look for a probably mathematical model

436
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,070
to help us calculate some numerical

437
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,720
values that actually will make sense it

438
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,939
may not be exactly what's human logic

439
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,100
with humans reality with numbers and

440
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,890
they look at the evidence but maybe it

441
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,340
can reflect what the humans would

442
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,930
believe him that's our next step at that

443
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,350
point so when we find that mathematical

444
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,120
model to maybe say if we can ascribe a

445
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,020
particularly American value to those tax

446
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,969
PRC can we design a function that

447
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,910
actually combine the evidence in other

448
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,980
ways which would be interpreted by human

449
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,830
I'll say you can have in this case we'll

450
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,360
be combining to average past we've got a

451
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,050
different number which is probably

452
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,580
higher confidence level the question is

453
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:43,980
what theory do we use know a thing oh of

454
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,500
course probability that's the first

455
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,540
answer now we actually try to try that

456
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,610
we try to be as an approach yes the

457
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,280
network but the result were always no

458
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,199
intuitive for some reason right so now

459
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,879
we sort of look at the problem and see

460
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,100
okay what was the cause of those

461
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,230
non-punitive result I know what could be

462
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,719
another theory to know to interpret

463
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,380
those calculations so the choice of a

464
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,690
theory turns out to be Dempster Schaefer

465
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,270
theory which you may have heard about

466
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,920
and this theory the reason we picked

467
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,629
that is because we found it's actually

468
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,940
is aligned better with the human

469
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,050
thinking process and the results are

470
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,020
also more meaningful we apply that

471
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:27,030
Sotiris theory is a non traditional

472
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:30,960
probability theory or

473
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:33,860
another possibility theory yes it is it

474
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,410
has been used in the different types of

475
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:41,189
applications in fusing the evidence or

476
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:43,950
accounting expert belief so the key

477
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,530
notion in the a-star to Kenosha - quote

478
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,010
belief

479
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:50,350
the other possibility so we are using

480
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,050
the belief notion here what that means

481
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,800
is you know how much we believe in a

482
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,600
fact this is slightly different than how

483
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,040
what's the probability that this event

484
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,500
is true if you think about that

485
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,780
for example we make women know there's

486
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,080
always a probability that there may be

487
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,080
no burglary that happened at my home

488
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,490
right it's always a probability I don't

489
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,159
know that but I don't have reason to

490
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,230
believe that my belief is zero because

491
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,120
we I don't have any evidence to support

492
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,480
that even the probability is always

493
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:27,429
there right another example is if I toss

494
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:30,250
a coin with the umpires with the unknown

495
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,520
bias so how like I've got a head muscle

496
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,250
pale pale it's not half of her because

497
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,050
the the bias is not not known so in

498
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,270
probability you really have to pick one

499
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,090
you cannot start any calculation without

500
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:47,170
knowing that you know prior distribution

501
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,879
but Indy as you can see I don't know no

502
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,750
evidence whatsoever to say whether it is

503
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,450
I just say either one right now bring

504
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,120
back to security you can say well

505
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:02,440
there's no evidence for attack I can't

506
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,229
ascribe my probability measurement to a

507
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,040
subset of my hypothesis so it's either

508
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,350
attack when you attack well I know

509
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,100
that's the key the key point for

510
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,669
modeling and we found that to be

511
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,050
extremely useful to conduct security

512
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,390
analysis because man and time we don't

513
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,840
really have the precise probability for

514
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,700
every event if we need to calculate the

515
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,350
overall probability of something being

516
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,780
true or false so and don't have the

517
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:31,120
numbers you can either pick one which

518
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,160
may be inaccurate the other garbage in

519
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,830
garbage out problem or worse if we don't

520
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,960
know all right so we tissa we've also

521
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,740
used we don't know right if I don't know

522
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,010
we just don't put any judgment on it so

523
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,590
that's sort of the reason and and also

524
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,420
there is a way to combine evidence from

525
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,760
multiple sources in TS and that's

526
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,570
exactly matching how the analysts use

527
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,500
multiple no evidence to support his or

528
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,860
her conclusion

529
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,200
now the the only thing is India's in the

530
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,389
classical TS the combination only works

531
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,010
for independent I have a little part but

532
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,289
you have a lot of dependency in those

533
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,840
evidence that you can get from logs or

534
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:15,590
events so how do you deal with that

535
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,590
so let me quickly show you how you can

536
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,990
set up this di space reasoning for the

537
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,980
time problem we were discussing the

538
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,740
first of all you actually going to

539
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:29,799
ascribe a numeric value for each level

540
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:32,900
of PR 6i which is a pick some number I

541
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,299
eventually only the ranking is used

542
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,400
we're not going to really interpret what

543
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,168
your point six means what matter is

544
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,370
different six is higher than two point

545
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:46,610
one so we just pick some numbers and to

546
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:50,030
give you a no you know numerical ranking

547
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:53,270
for each level of confidence and then

548
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,270
for every alert your señores system you

549
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,480
can actually prescribe this number to

550
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,370
the sensor actually is created it the

551
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,710
sensor in this case could be just an IDs

552
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:08,899
signature different people have

553
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:11,690
different ways of you take no problem if

554
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,789
you read their route description put how

555
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,799
is possible means this or likely means

556
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:18,650
that we can use those natural language

557
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:21,770
description to infer those those tags

558
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,960
and then the tags to the numbers and

559
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,350
then the next step is to set up the

560
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,360
reasoning okay so in deers there's

561
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,020
notion called frames of discernment and

562
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,699
that means you can actually describe a

563
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,039
disjoint set of states for a question of

564
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,190
concern so in this case we have a

565
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,289
question of concern of you have an alert

566
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:46,370
it's either you trust it or don't trust

567
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:48,320
it okay that means it's the started tool

568
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,408
the job is supposed to be doing or is

569
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,809
telling me something that's irrelevant

570
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:57,200
and then you also have a hypothesis I am

571
00:25:53,809 --> 00:26:00,320
probe IP 1 IP 2 now the matter of

572
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,250
question here is is it true or false to

573
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,720
believe that so now have two friends of

574
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,730
frames of determined and process in the

575
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,940
ask for translation of actually

576
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:18,410
Matt one from the other and the actual

577
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:21,590
map every element in the stores domain

578
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,530
of translation to a subset of elements

579
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:28,010
in the destination domain so since we do

580
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:31,040
have a possible type here so we are

581
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,970
going to first describe the 0.1 weight

582
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,159
to trust me

583
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,200
worthy so you trust the alert with still

584
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,640
point one weight I'm a super nice don't

585
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,250
trust it and again these are applied to

586
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:47,000
subsets these are still similar success

587
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:49,370
may they start a single element and then

588
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,730
we are going to see starting with

589
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:56,179
trustworthy how that correspond to your

590
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,460
believe in the probe everyone to IP to

591
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,760
so what we do here is to are going to

592
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:04,160
find what we call compatible elements in

593
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,340
a destination domain with the source

594
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:11,450
don't make and the Lord was fired

595
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,300
if you trust it then you have to say

596
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,060
this hypothesis is true that's what the

597
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,250
earliest is supposed to capture so trust

598
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:23,240
was the case only it's only compatible

599
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:26,960
with the true case in the probe IP 1 IP

600
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,120
2 when the other hand is don't trust the

601
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,490
alert me which means maybe what the

602
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,149
seller is actually detecting it's a

603
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,010
wrong thing it's not the attack and that

604
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,560
would do is say well we cannot really

605
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:43,310
say the attack is false because there

606
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,159
may be an attack similar to cast this

607
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:49,100
IPS signature is not doing the right

608
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,010
thing doesn't mean there's no attack it

609
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,740
may have missed it it may be detecting

610
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,550
repeating some benign behavior but the

611
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,650
tag may be going out anyway regardless

612
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:03,740
so we don't we said we don't know so I

613
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,780
don't trust the sensors result you just

614
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,180
say now I don't know if there's this

615
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,010
problem happening or not that still

616
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,140
could be one simply because this

617
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:16,129
particular way of detecting is does not

618
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:18,080
really work right so and this actually

619
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,060
capital open-endedness of cyber security

620
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,810
there are always different ways of doing

621
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,600
bad things

622
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:26,570
we can now ever be exhaustive about

623
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,428
to say we can definitely a certain

624
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:35,600
there's no such thing going out so we we

625
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:38,360
map this to either true or false I never

626
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,070
do this now over the whole proof graph

627
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,110
so for each of them will have this kind

628
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:45,530
of setup and then we are going to start

629
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,809
with each alert sense of quality metrics

630
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,789
which we'll use alpha beta comma to

631
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:54,580
represent now we're going to translate

632
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:56,960
their magic to the corresponding

633
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,710
probability ways to the stood to the

634
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,360
power set of the hypothesis and then by

635
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,309
me you have multiple evidential past

636
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,250
entering into the same high posit you

637
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:11,120
have to combine them so in TS there's a

638
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:14,120
way to combine two branches of evidence

639
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,959
into a single probability assignment we

640
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,719
just applied here and you have a new

641
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,860
value after the combination and then

642
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,559
keep going now at this point we have a

643
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,928
slight problem here because the three

644
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,780
objects pass actually are not completely

645
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:35,929
independent as you can see the left two

646
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:39,710
paths are partially overlapping two

647
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:41,960
others produced by the same signature so

648
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,720
if you don't trust that signature simply

649
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,200
because you have two corroborating

650
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,090
evidence

651
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,890
you should not really strengthen your

652
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,350
believe since you're actually double

653
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,570
count counting on that signature in two

654
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:57,230
places so you have to address this type

655
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:59,658
of or partially dependent evidence in

656
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:02,870
the combination process and there was no

657
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:05,270
a single solution for doing this people

658
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,639
have proposed all kinds of solution but

659
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:11,080
we wanted to focus on our problem

660
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,840
I want to follow the cut line from the

661
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,809
the the one of the inventors of terms of

662
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,600
a theory why she followed Schafer's

663
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:23,450
guideline 200 is not independent of the

664
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,418
path but customize it based on our

665
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,000
specific problem so our competition is

666
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:31,159
only applicable to our problems only

667
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,890
this type of proof were not in generic

668
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,190
Diaz reasoning but it it actually will

669
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,930
give you a mean of

670
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:41,490
meaningful results that assume

671
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:43,770
everything is independent so then we did

672
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,950
that and now the next thing is okay now

673
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:50,340
we have the theory as good as pure o2 to

674
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,100
use it and apply it in some actual data

675
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,800
and even in a real real world so we

676
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,010
build to course nibs so what it does is

677
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,500
it actually takes North alert and give a

678
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,000
meaning for each store signature and

679
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,830
this only time once we did some simple

680
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,650
no heuristic out and based on a human

681
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,840
language description of the store rule

682
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,480
signature to you further meaning and

683
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,580
their weight and based on those key

684
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,730
words we can find and once we have that

685
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,500
we can apply this and the internal model

686
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:28,740
that correlates those hypotheses to the

687
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,500
income of snort alert and then ask the

688
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,310
question based on all these rotar can

689
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,230
get from Network and based on reasoning

690
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,570
please tell me you know what the

691
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,510
possible facts you can derive with

692
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:45,600
corresponding belief value and we rank

693
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,530
them based on how likely that fact is

694
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,959
true or not

695
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,660
now you can output those hypotheses in

696
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,420
something like this and the goal is to

697
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,420
see if this can help a human Alice to to

698
00:31:54,420 --> 00:32:00,360
do to do their job if you have ever got

699
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,950
blood running a store on a even a small

700
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,709
size that's where you see there if you

701
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,200
don't do anything the popgun no hundreds

702
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,810
of thousands of others every day so we

703
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,630
tried it on our network or departmental

704
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,820
net worth of god not tens of thousands

705
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,550
of others every day and most of them are

706
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,780
false positive simply because the rules

707
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,220
are very conservative

708
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,430
I just would capture a remote

709
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:27,000
possibility of attack many cases rather

710
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:28,680
do something to help a human to go

711
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,170
through this now what do you mean by

712
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:35,280
helping well we want to see can the

713
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:38,250
ranking provided by the RPS you can

714
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,350
really reduce human labor that's the

715
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,180
first thing we want to see that's the

716
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,490
second question to ask is is it really

717
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,650
what we did that makes that happen or

718
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,050
just happened by them

719
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,420
for instance is it really what we did

720
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,690
all this customer customizing yes theory

721
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:57,000
that really makes that difference so in

722
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,990
order to see that we need to have data

723
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,050
with ground truth

724
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,850
and I know it's not easy I switch for

725
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:06,270
this type of problem I mean it you know

726
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:08,040
you want to have no logs alerts and then

727
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,250
you know which words are really true

728
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:16,050
orders and they were probably I'm aware

729
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:18,929
of two data sets that have done this one

730
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,678
is the very well-known Lincoln laptop or

731
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,390
Taylor selfish

732
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,940
probably know has a lot of problems

733
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,890
there and there's also newer one is IR

734
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,380
port editor that we you can get from

735
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:31,170
predict there are many problem for those

736
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,050
kind of data because they are generated

737
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:35,370
by some human synthesis process so the

738
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:39,389
word theory is generate with it will

739
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:41,879
give you some skill distribution on the

740
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,360
patterns so if you use the data to train

741
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,530
your model is not going to be very very

742
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,870
valid but we won't use it for testing so

743
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,550
that's how we avoid those pitfalls now

744
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,379
and and then we don't really look at the

745
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,800
data to develop our mouth that's also

746
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,610
very important to just thought or to get

747
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,678
those data how true was completely

748
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,959
independent of those two the space are

749
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,870
our understanding of humanist job and

750
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,639
then place our we look at those North

751
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:15,060
documentation to derive those meanings

752
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,100
let's see how it works right now long

753
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,739
term don't really use field deployment

754
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,139
but that there's some Chinese there at

755
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:24,689
which I want to talk about later right

756
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,320
so what I want to look at is does the

757
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,659
ranking

758
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,840
provided by our Diaz calculation really

759
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,120
gives you a meaningful prioritization so

760
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,679
if you said we hypothesis what your

761
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:41,750
lures a certain value i say among all

762
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,820
only going to look at alert that support

763
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,750
hypothesis with at least the 0.9 and

764
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,419
that's my cutoff

765
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,780
all right anything below that i don't

766
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,080
care

767
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,200
then you can actually compute precision

768
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,610
recall precision means if you only take

769
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,210
that or lures what

770
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:05,720
proportion of those relaxed waters of

771
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:07,790
the heart better if boy or girl is

772
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,810
taller than you do end up wasting humans

773
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:15,529
time right one is the best now if you

774
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:17,660
move the threshold lower now I have one

775
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:22,670
minus potential here so this is actually

776
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:25,819
1 and you move it lower you movin on the

777
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,700
right part of the S axis you want to see

778
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,690
a decrease in the precision so that

779
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,549
means the higher threshold gives you

780
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,370
more likely you actually true earth if

781
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,590
you move to a more lower threshold you

782
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,480
might be wasting more time and that's

783
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,460
the meaningful prioritization and that's

784
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:50,210
what what we see in the Lincoln lab

785
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:52,300
Doppler data set and do it again for the

786
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,310
predict I opera now there is a slight

787
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,980
anomaly here but overall the trend is

788
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:01,580
still going down as your cutoff move

789
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:07,730
from from high to low so that's good

790
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:10,400
news so green line is the the fraction

791
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,160
of total alert that you have to look at

792
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,370
if I said that as the threshold so the

793
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,129
precision is the true owners divided by

794
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:21,650
the total number the yet the total

795
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:24,830
number of row and that's the fraction of

796
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:28,220
total number so if your car - well here

797
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:31,279
you're only looking at about maybe 2

798
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,080
percent of the overall on earth so you

799
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,420
are saving some effort there but as you

800
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,490
move the circle lower and lower you are

801
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,490
going to have to process more and more

802
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,899
alerts and then the record will also

803
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,250
grow up which means you have to capture

804
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:48,650
more two attacks but it's not going is

805
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:51,830
well in that case that is growing faster

806
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:57,580
than this one now in that case it's

807
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:57,580
actually not as fast as the total effort

808
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,040
so and then we want to see whether all

809
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,980
of this is because we did this

810
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,990
complicated computation and maybe you

811
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,810
just do something similar which can get

812
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,839
the same part had part prioritization in

813
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:21,779
fact so then what we did is to see what

814
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,950
if you only say take the standard I'm

815
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,860
such a fan theory without any

816
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:28,230
customization to deal with it or

817
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:33,330
partially dependent evidence which will

818
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:35,460
give you the standard the s-curve or it

819
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,670
can just take the maximum note in any

820
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,490
correlation graph and take that as the

821
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,680
weight for every follower spin that in

822
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:46,200
that graph or just don't do any

823
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,629
correlation just take each single alerts

824
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,589
quality metrics as the decision point

825
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,980
how can we compare these different

826
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:59,120
different approaches we compare them by

827
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,890
parting the ROC curve the receiver

828
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,859
operation catalystic curve so what that

829
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:07,920
means is you have ax as it's been the

830
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,640
most positive and the lower the better

831
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,970
and why is the true positive that means

832
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,029
the percentage of true actually you

833
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:20,580
captured the one is the best and this is

834
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,880
the most optimal point but we can never

835
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:28,410
get there the closer to this point the

836
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,990
better the system right so then you can

837
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,690
see what we did I should move the point

838
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,669
closer to the most optimum points

839
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,280
actually made it difference so it's not

840
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,160
by chance there's at work it you do need

841
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,930
to do all of this to get a better result

842
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:51,839
and the same trend you can see in the

843
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:53,970
predict Aiyappa data set as well so

844
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,610
these are just some sort of sanity check

845
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:59,339
to see if you can ever have a chance of

846
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,720
working at all if even that doesn't work

847
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,240
there probably we don't even want to

848
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,129
bother doing a field deployment but

849
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,410
after this point or so maybe let's see

850
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,040
how it can work in a real network and

851
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:13,440
that's a real test you throw it into a

852
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,210
production system and see whether it can

853
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,130
find out true problems

854
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,920
and that's what I did I was divided as

855
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,890
her own departmental Network we had

856
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,710
students analyzing the output you can

857
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,690
get how that works I know it took we did

858
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,030
have a webmaster who have some sitting

859
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,099
with me in background so to help now you

860
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,470
need to have those expertise to

861
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,109
interpret the result but still we have

862
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:39,660
problem a challenges I would say is hard

863
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:42,060
to find true incident they are rare they

864
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,180
don't always happen why do this

865
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,460
experiment maybe no attacks so we don't

866
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,060
really get a lot of interesting type

867
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,970
cases and then most of the things asked

868
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,890
you you know for correlations but you

869
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,689
want to know why does happen you have to

870
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,569
analyze those hopeful to see why that

871
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:03,030
happened now that means some domain

872
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,910
knowledge and more contextual

873
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:09,359
information to really see it as a false

874
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,980
alarm or not unfortunately our sitter or

875
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,569
me has really helped us a lot

876
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,810
he didn't have a lot of time more time

877
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,130
to even help us to interpret the result

878
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:20,190
and this is not something he actually

879
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:23,010
normally used at work so why would he

880
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,500
spend time to see yet another tool and

881
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:28,859
try to use that and understand the

882
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,510
result it may not work after war right

883
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,480
so we didn't really get a lot of help in

884
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,160
terms of interpreting the result and we

885
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,940
did not have a lot of experience in

886
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,089
security and latex and we don't really

887
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,609
have data access like for server logs

888
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:46,650
but it did matter we do not really can

889
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,020
we cannot log in to get those logs and

890
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:51,060
see what was really around to confirm

891
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,300
that so all of these were challenges for

892
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,380
this research and we were sort of stuck

893
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,599
stuck for a while

894
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:02,400
and now we think okay maybe we should

895
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,780
rethink our research strategy maybe the

896
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,900
first thing that we need to do is to

897
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,740
learn how to do security and underneath

898
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,230
stop the got that's crucial in

899
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,618
understanding the output from our tool

900
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:18,089
and maybe given no more important is cut

901
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,390
off a strands of what is really needed

902
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:23,369
what is really missing in the operation

903
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,118
okay so this job is actually more art

904
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:27,089
than a science

905
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,859
a lot of hunch feelings no manuals

906
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:32,788
there's no act for more training photos

907
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:35,549
just the throw at the top do it it's a

908
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:37,619
learning tool to the pain so we have to

909
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:40,259
go through the same process in order to

910
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,779
get the tacit knowledge embedded in that

911
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:45,140
rock environment an R&R is not really

912
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:47,299
written down it's a very new field and

913
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,038
people haven't really got around to

914
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:52,349
synthesize the essential processes and

915
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,150
skills that are needed for this job

916
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:57,680
and that's also challenged in training

917
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:01,309
as well so then you know what can we do

918
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,910
how can we get to the tacit knowledge

919
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:08,339
you know in in a no in a good way

920
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,920
well there's really no better way than

921
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:13,259
being part of the operation and that has

922
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,739
been started in a different set up by

923
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:21,089
true and apologies the only one is that

924
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:24,029
how humans learn and and and what what

925
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:27,089
gene lave did was that she actually went

926
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:30,359
to Liberia for quite a few years and she

927
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:32,819
spent extended period time just to study

928
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:35,940
and observe how trailers they are learn

929
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:38,549
their jobs and they can do they can make

930
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,440
very nice clothes mimicking what was

931
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:42,869
shown in this no terrorist fashion show

932
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,779
these are really highly skilled tailors

933
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:47,700
and she wanted to see how I should learn

934
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:50,009
the job I shouldn't see how the

935
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,140
apprentice of the tailors actually got

936
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:54,869
to learn how to do the Merriman design

937
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,879
cutting putting things together well

938
00:42:54,869 --> 00:43:00,329
what she found is there was no training

939
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,150
I thought the master didn't train the

940
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:04,640
new tailors they just started working

941
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,319
right away and the first two the

942
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,940
finishing work I just put on the buttons

943
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:14,960
getting the final no weaving touches and

944
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:18,150
I'm moving quite it was more about

945
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,839
skills and then learn by doing and by

946
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:25,499
observing not very surprising I would

947
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,450
say but the finding after this study had

948
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:31,980
passed another study that she did after

949
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:34,710
he returned to us showed that not like

950
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,049
what people tend to believe knowledge

951
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,940
and learning is not always explicit and

952
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:41,609
we all learn in some way with the other

953
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,540
we take classes we sit in the classroom

954
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:45,420
that

955
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,300
learning about learning also happens in

956
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,390
the subtle way it's often embedded or

957
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,850
even embodied in practice so you learn

958
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,370
that by doing it and you learn from your

959
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,290
peers so there's a social dimension to

960
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,540
acknowledge as well if you are not part

961
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:03,300
of the social organization you're not

962
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,460
going to learn it okay and that's

963
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,650
actually sort of put me in a sort of

964
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,930
very if anything you know say maybe

965
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,990
we'll never have to worry about those

966
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,819
the MOOCs will dry up the university out

967
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:17,279
of business because I have to learn by

968
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,380
being here the social clashing is very

969
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,460
important very important factor in

970
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:25,590
learning so the conclusion from their

971
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,840
research is that in order to get the

972
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,820
person knowledge that are embedded in

973
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,850
that workplace you have to become part

974
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,710
of that what they call communities of

975
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:36,960
practice you have to draw in that

976
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,940
community to be able to extract the

977
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,490
tacit knowledge found from that and

978
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,980
that's what brought us to our new

979
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:47,069
project on bring anthropology into

980
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:51,810
cybersecurity so sort of start from the

981
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:53,670
very fundamental question is how onerous

982
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,940
to to the club in the first place can we

983
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:59,160
understand that and can we model it

984
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,770
precisely we did it through interviewing

985
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,990
I would talk to friends who get the job

986
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:07,590
by them that's probably not going to be

987
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:09,750
enough a lot of the subtleties were

988
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,390
hidden in the work themselves if it if

989
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,250
you are not there your power is hard for

990
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:18,210
you to really catch the the core of the

991
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:20,640
knowledge so what we did supported by

992
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,520
the NSF grant is to have multiple

993
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,040
students embedded in security operations

994
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,100
of different types of organizations so

995
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,560
obviously we had our own University

996
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,140
security which we had a very good

997
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,240
working relationship so we had three of

998
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,250
the students embedded they're working on

999
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,109
different aspects of the job that they

1000
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,260
love to do just working like an analyst

1001
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:45,390
that's like a trainee there and I've

1002
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,600
also had one of those three students to

1003
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:52,100
be embedded he actually worked at the HP

1004
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:55,270
security operation center for six months

1005
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,210
to learn how actually

1006
00:45:55,270 --> 00:46:00,700
in a commercial setting we had a one

1007
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,550
summer intro embedded in Hollywood sock

1008
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:06,399
for three months and I was still trying

1009
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:08,670
to expand that into more places to see

1010
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,920
whether we can find recurring patterns

1011
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:17,050
or something is unique to the particular

1012
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,690
company we started found out so so far

1013
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:23,320
was very different from what we thought

1014
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:26,200
we were going to find there are a few

1015
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:29,140
points here the first thing that we

1016
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,089
found out right away was simple problem

1017
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,549
very simple problems do not have

1018
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:35,880
solutions in either no commercial

1019
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:39,220
off-the-shelf or open source tools

1020
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,140
things like how to map externally

1021
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,560
observable IP address to an internal

1022
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,480
view device is an unsolved problem in

1023
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,200
practice even though it's childress

1024
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,560
although by building some log parsing

1025
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,720
and then database caching to speed up

1026
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,070
look up those content were not even

1027
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,250
there in any of the two that we have

1028
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:02,440
found people have to do in a very really

1029
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,200
mad really man through way I took

1030
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,040
minutes to find this device for single

1031
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,890
IP now we went in with that the split up

1032
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,060
to only a couple seconds I said that

1033
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,160
something to really make a huge

1034
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,950
difference in operation even though it's

1035
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,170
not really rocket science and also I had

1036
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,410
the problem of we all had a challenge of

1037
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,730
getting our research tools used by

1038
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:27,819
operation people because they just don't

1039
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:32,410
have time oh don't have the interest

1040
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:33,880
sometimes now once we were there what

1041
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,670
her we built was taken right away

1042
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,550
but by the analyst there was no

1043
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,890
hesitancy because they knew what we

1044
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,350
build was directly embedded in their

1045
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,960
workflow they can see found five minutes

1046
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:50,920
to two seconds that saved our time a lot

1047
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,350
so it grabs it right away and very

1048
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,050
interesting finding is when they are

1049
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,029
couldn't use our tool use it in more

1050
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:02,380
ways than we thought it is it was

1051
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:04,450
designed for that actually opens up more

1052
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,780
tacit knowledge discovery but they'll

1053
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,890
ask oh you can do this that maybe if you

1054
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,190
was at least

1055
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:14,170
you can also do that I never knew that

1056
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,940
we needed to do that because they didn't

1057
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,190
see the two in the first place they

1058
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,589
cannot think about that will become a

1059
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,329
useful feature if you ask them what do

1060
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:23,920
you need they will not tell you until

1061
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:27,599
they see the very very first prototype

1062
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,390
oh yeah that I see you can actually

1063
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,369
enrich it to achieve this and that's

1064
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:36,190
important because I usually have this

1065
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:39,359
case which above that so then you know

1066
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:41,980
all of that as this tool driven

1067
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,859
knowledge this discovery is sort of

1068
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,999
different than the traditional

1069
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:49,930
anthropological notion of tacit or

1070
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:52,509
explicit knowledge conversion so in the

1071
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:55,808
classical conversion you have now you

1072
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:58,180
become the apprentice of the people and

1073
00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:00,609
you learn the tacit knowledge this way

1074
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,710
and then you know you walk back I think

1075
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:05,288
about what you do and reflect

1076
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,539
reconstruct the actions and then you

1077
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:09,789
make that explicit and that's sort of

1078
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:12,519
the end of the story and you write about

1079
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:16,329
them you publish but now we're actually

1080
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,939
going to turn that into models and tools

1081
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:21,519
that I can feed back into the community

1082
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,039
and they are readily accepted by the

1083
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:27,069
community and that drives more passive

1084
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:28,480
knowledge discovery and then it also

1085
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:31,180
helps the people who do the job

1086
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,410
understand better how they do they do

1087
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,390
that girl and that's actually the quote

1088
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,950
from one of the owners that we work with

1089
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,348
is they oh it really helped you asked

1090
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,058
know better what with power - with - our

1091
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:42,489
dog because everything now becomes much

1092
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:47,140
more clear as we see how everything

1093
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:50,079
works in the tool so no again you know

1094
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,509
just in summary I truly believe this

1095
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,920
anthropological method are highly

1096
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:56,289
relevant to cyber security research

1097
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,589
because we have enormous humans human

1098
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:01,150
bones but defender and that offender and

1099
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,999
we can actually benefit by walking down

1100
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,489
the petals of academia and drawing the

1101
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:08,680
community of practice in certain ways to

1102
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:10,089
try to get the tacit knowledge and then

1103
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,058
not remotely

1104
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:16,180
convert that convert that into more

1105
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:19,480
useful technologies so guess with that I

1106
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:22,950
would like to thank you and that any

1107
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,950
person I'd like to take

1108
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,610
do you still have students working as a

1109
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:44,620
analyst now at the at the my university

1110
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,570
yeah yeah yeah there are still a couple

1111
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:50,319
students there and they are just there

1112
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:52,750
all the time and so they're actually

1113
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,940
they have you know developed certain

1114
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,860
framework that is embedded into their

1115
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,800
their work nozzle using that as a way to

1116
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:02,080
share more problems for research as well

1117
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,620
so it sort of served us well I suppose

1118
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,840
we have to have no data access for whole

1119
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:12,960
campus network we can do a lot of

1120
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,960
interesting research on that platform

1121
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,859
Thank You second coming
