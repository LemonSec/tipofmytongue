1
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:43,720
that's the way she got it good afternoon

2
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,670
welcome to a serious security seminar

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,030
it's my great pleasure to introduce

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,730
today's speaker dr. Steve a beloved

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,710
Steve is a per CK and Vito

6
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,680
Aldabra hudson professor of computer

7
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,309
science at Columbia University and Steve

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:06,640
is a true pioneer of both networking and

9
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:09,940
security he received in 1995 he received

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,729
unique lifetime achievement award for

11
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,830
creating net news when he was a graduate

12
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:18,310
student and I believe that also when

13
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:23,400
Steve started Mad Professor Spafford

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:26,409
online and then soon after in person and

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,299
Steve is also co-author of the book far

16
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,350
was an Internet security the first book

17
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,250
on fire war

18
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,009
he received the 2007 NIST NSA national

19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,930
computer security systems award and has

20
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,540
been elected to cybersecurity Hall of

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,640
Fame Steve is a member of National

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,680
Academy of Engineering and had also

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,500
served as the chief technologist of the

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,170
Federal Trade Commission so today Steve

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:57,760
will talk about a law for hacking thank

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:59,890
you okay it's still here it went black

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,570
that's probably why when I plug it in

28
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:07,500
again it's it's always the if this

29
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,389
doesn't work I plug in my flash drive

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,030
that's why I carry a flash drive with my

31
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:21,760
dog yeah we go almost here almost yeah

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:24,640
yeah now we're ready to go here we go

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,659
okay we pause for technical difficulties

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,809
okay so more and more of my time I find

35
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:34,359
I spending on things that are not really

36
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,940
quote computer security unquote I do

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,310
history of cryptography a lot of fun and

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,989
I do a lot of public policy work about

39
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,990
half of my professional effort these

40
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,350
days is on

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,150
where technology meets policy especially

42
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:52,060
when it comes to privacy surveillance

43
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,770
and in the u.s. the Fourth Amendment and

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,150
really the issue today is wiretapping

45
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:01,070
and it used to be easy you take phone

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,050
lines were just twisted pairs running

47
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,450
all the way from your house to phone

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,190
company Central's officers where I

49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,810
switched for it I've just barely old

50
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,609
enough to remember actually seeing a

51
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,380
switchboard like this a plug in court

52
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,690
switchboard in person was about five

53
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,460
years old that's all one day uh but just

54
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,680
you know pair of alligator clips and

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,200
headphones on the twisted pair you could

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,350
wiretap very easily you didn't really

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,060
need a lot of technology so once upon a

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,180
time law enforcement had it good also

59
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,310
legally in that first time a wiretapping

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,890
case hit the Supreme Court sometime in

61
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,870
the 1920s a case known as Olmstead the

62
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,429
court held that this was not a search

63
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,120
within the meaning of the Fourth

64
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,060
Amendment

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,970
so no search warrant was needed they

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:48,620
reversed that in 1967 the case known as

67
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,870
Katz modern wiretapping

68
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,950
for people for the people who still have

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,770
traditional telephone lines a vanishing

70
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,799
percentage at this point is about the

71
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,690
same instead of the alligator clips and

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,820
sitting out in a cold rainy day with the

73
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,790
earphones they take this device over

74
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,130
here called a loop extender if you

75
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,100
attach one pair of wires and loop

76
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,960
extender to the targets phone line and

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,510
take another twisted pair going back to

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,920
the central office it's not to use and

79
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,779
you attach that's called the friendly

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,610
pair and you attach the other pair of

81
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,739
wires to the friendly pair and you could

82
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,660
sit in a nice warm office to listen to

83
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,460
your target instead and rather than

84
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,460
listening the whole time with earphones

85
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,049
use this nice small tape recorder so

86
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,669
this tape record also the kind that they

87
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,870
use for carrying a wire yeah that's the

88
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,120
kind of tape recorder that they use

89
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,590
these days of course be an mp3 recorder

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,390
but small and robust these pictures for

91
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,310
my friend Matt Blais who study

92
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,030
surveillance and collects to collect

93
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,030
interesting gear

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,230
things started changing for law

95
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,510
enforcement around 19 late 1979 though

96
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,800
they didn't it wasn't realized

97
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,000
immediately to be a threat to

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,030
traditional wiretapping

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,060
uh when you have touch-tone phones you

100
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,489
can send signals after the call is set

101
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,580
up not just for actually dialing in a

102
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,160
1979 a couple of competitive long

103
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,159
distance companies sprint and MCI sprint

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,040
is still around what was MCI is now part

105
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,340
of horizon she filed to become alternate

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,370
long distance carriers because of the

107
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,950
regulatory climate at the time you

108
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,410
dialed a local number to connect to

109
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,630
sprint or MCI you dialed your account

110
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,640
number with touch tones then you dialed

111
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,300
the actual number you wanted to connect

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:49,349
to suddenly what was part of the phone

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,600
call was not part of the phone call

114
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,520
anymore it was dialing information you

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,650
didn't have this nice neat separation

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,810
boundary he started getting redialing

117
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,510
services of various source prepaid

118
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,910
telephone credit cards for example the

119
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,920
original number dialed might not be the

120
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,470
number of interest so wiretapping was

121
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,360
already getting more complicated and you

122
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,720
get a cut extra services like call

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,130
forwarding he tapping somebody's line

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,480
but the person is not home they were off

125
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,230
someplace else and their number is

126
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,620
forwarded someplace else and it life was

127
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:25,080
starting to get horner then the FBI for

128
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,880
all that I haven't probably will make

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,880
nasty comments about them saw this

130
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,320
coming earlier than most they knew there

131
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,780
was a problem it was as as it turned out

132
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,930
what they most of what they anticipated

133
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,250
to be a problem wasn't technology went

134
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,890
in a different direction they had

135
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,130
anticipated but they were already having

136
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:50,340
problems about cell phones imagine

137
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,530
yourself as a prosecutor in the 1980s a

138
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,679
state prosecutor in the 1980s when cell

139
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,799
phones were very unusual going to a

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,770
judge say in New York the story of a

141
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,710
woman I knew and telling the judge that

142
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,849
you want to get a wiretap order for what

143
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,070
looks to the judge like a California

144
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,320
phone number the judge is not heard of

145
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,940
cell phones say what I don't have

146
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,620
jurisdiction in San Francisco

147
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,300
no your honor this is New York but it's

148
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,420
a California phone number yes your honor

149
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I understand that they knew that there

150
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,270
were more changes coming so I got

151
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,090
Congress to pass a law known as Korea's

152
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,830
Kalia the communications assistance to

153
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,460
law enforcement act it was a

154
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,719
controversial act at the time for me was

155
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,210
actually good because one of the two

156
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,520
things that got me involved in doing

157
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,080
public policy as a professional activity

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,680
the other was cryptography I'll get to

159
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,690
it in a little while but they got

160
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,950
Congress to pass this law called Kalia

161
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,560
and what Kalia said is we don't care how

162
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,050
you build your phone network we don't

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,800
care if it's traditional twisted-pair or

164
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,900
cell phones or ISDN which they thought

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,090
the time would be the hot high-speed

166
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,440
data networking thing because it had the

167
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,450
truly magnificent speed for the day of

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:14,120
128 kilobits per second that was

169
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,280
preposterous lehigh in 1992 4800 bits

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,010
per second was unusually high and most

171
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,289
people who were 1200 bits per second so

172
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,150
I think tenfold increase that's great

173
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:28,730
hundred don't you all want to be online

174
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:32,809
under 28 kilobits a second however you

175
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:35,720
implement your phone technology whatever

176
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:39,169
it is there has to be a standard

177
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,660
interface in the phone switch and the

178
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,209
FBI or local law enforcement can plug

179
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,490
into the standard interface and say tap

180
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,940
this phone number and everything else

181
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,550
just works it's up to you as the phone

182
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,430
switch designer as the telephone company

183
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,829
to engineer to configure things

184
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:02,689
appropriately so this simple interface

185
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:05,750
works the interface isn't so simple the

186
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:10,310
code is even less simple but the thought

187
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,770
was make wiretapping about as simple as

188
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,619
allottee - alligator Gibson alligator

189
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,540
clips on twisted pair were in 1920

190
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,860
and this was a very popular idea with

191
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,099
lots of governments around the world

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,380
more or less every country certainly

193
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,890
every developed country has a similar

194
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,010
law

195
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,140
the generic name is lawful intercept it

196
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,960
sounds like a great idea for law

197
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,210
congressman's perspective some of us

198
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:41,190
were warning that this was a dangerous

199
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:46,050
notion and we were right lawful

200
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:48,840
intercept is a deliberate backdoor it is

201
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,050
designed to let somebody else listen to

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,270
a phone call it in theory only law

203
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,810
enforcement can get at it but hey this

204
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,819
is code phone switches are among the

205
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,109
most complicated pieces of software you

206
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,890
are going to find a modern phone switch

207
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,230
what's the population of this town about

208
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,840
a hundred and twenty thousand probably

209
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:17,940
within the region of a single maybe to

210
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:21,210
AT&T five e SSE's and you will have a

211
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,700
separate microprocessor for every line

212
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,110
card serving every telephone so every

213
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,960
telephone in this town back when

214
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,060
everyone had a landline AT&T was a

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,970
separate microprocessor all plugged into

216
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,369
one backplane massively despair Allah

217
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,190
massively distributed system very very

218
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,460
complex code for a while when I was at

219
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,140
Bell Labs I was in the research

220
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,310
department software engineering research

221
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,260
department for the phone switch

222
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,089
developers so I got to see up close and

223
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,510
personal how complicated this code base

224
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:56,820
was uh it's a computer it's hackable and

225
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,510
in Athens Athens Greece not the one in

226
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,840
Georgia

227
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,360
somebody just who is not known know

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,950
there's been a lot of speculation

229
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,640
hacked a mobile phone switch in

230
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:12,510
particular they abused the lawful

231
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,490
intercept mechanism that his Ericsson

232
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,939
had by law had to build into their phone

233
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,610
switches and they used it to tap about a

234
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,010
hundred different mobile phones up to

235
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,830
and including the Prime Minister's you

236
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,700
know phone switches do not run Windows

237
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,620
they don't run Linux

238
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:36,460
they're not programmed in C whoever did

239
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,860
this was skilled in arcane programming

240
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,900
languages in our and unusual programming

241
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,330
environments most hackers do not have a

242
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,069
five ESS auren Ericsson mobile phone

243
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,520
switch in their basements to experiment

244
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,260
with so everyone is pretty confident

245
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,949
this was an intelligence agency which

246
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,220
country

247
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,710
take your guess all and they relay the

248
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,930
intercepted calls to another one of

249
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,350
three mobile phones bought over the

250
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,819
counter for cash at some store in Athens

251
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,680
so we don't know what was we just know

252
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,080
that because the calls of being relayed

253
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,130
out through the same Tower

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,290
that was in roughly oh call it one and a

255
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,110
half kilometer to kill me the radius of

256
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,089
a particular point which includes the

257
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,950
Prime Minister's office which includes a

258
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,080
number of embassies including the u.s.

259
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,960
embassy take your choice pick your

260
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,360
government some high-end intelligence

261
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,240
agency did this hack and it would not

262
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,920
have been possible had the lawful

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,500
intercept capability not to be

264
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,540
impressive it takes a lot of code to do

265
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,040
something like this but thank you

266
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,709
Erikson's are already done the hard work

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,069
all they had to do was install the extra

268
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,260
little bit of software who installed it

269
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,270
how it was installed is not known to

270
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,150
this day if you want to know what is

271
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,680
known here's the article to read by the

272
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,030
way an older version of this talk is on

273
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
my web page with all these nice

274
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,300
clickable URLs it's called the Athens

275
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,760
affair and it's very much worth reading

276
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,280
it's a lesson in humility for software

277
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,600
developers don't assume you can get the

278
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,600
security mechanisms right

279
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,859
the problem isn't just grease there were

280
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,920
lapped procedural etcetera lapses by a

281
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,679
Vodafone grease it's not just Ericsson

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,050
switches at one point the NSA tested

283
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,449
every Kalia compliant phone switch sold

284
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,139
in the US and every single one of them

285
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:35,899
had security problems there was a larger

286
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,910
abuse of the lawful intercept capability

287
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,980
in Italy thousands of people affected

288
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,089
that's forgotten has gotten less

289
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,699
publicity some of the attacks on Google

290
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,519
five years ago attributed to China the

291
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:52,069
target of those attacks was a database

292
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,040
showing which users with the subject of

293
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:57,040
wiretap orders was this at the request

294
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,670
of the Chinese government I don't know I

295
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,699
have my meds

296
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,549
and there are rumors not substantiated

297
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,859
the Russian mob has hacked into kaliya

298
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:11,689
interfaces in the u.s. to spy on law

299
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:14,749
enforcement so yeah this is a problem we

300
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:19,248
built in this deliberate back door to

301
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:22,490
let law enforcement conduct just legally

302
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:25,549
authorized wiretap but we can't really

303
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:30,529
control who uses this door and other

304
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:34,369
people seem to be using it as well and

305
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:37,879
then technology changed again and for

306
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:40,429
all that Kalia seemed to be the nice

307
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:44,449
architecture and technology independent

308
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:47,299
solution in 1994 technology changed in a

309
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,399
way that the FBI didn't anticipate and

310
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,579
that no one in Congress I suspect could

311
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,639
even conceive of back in 1994 remember

312
00:14:52,579 --> 00:15:00,679
that in 1994 the internet was very very

313
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:05,299
new it's not known to most people with

314
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:07,179
pcs did not have the tcp/ip built in

315
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:10,189
into Windows 95

316
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,379
so most people could not get online if

317
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,629
you got a line it was you were in the

318
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,839
minority you did it by dialing up to AOL

319
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,850
and let them get on the internet for you

320
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,799
so this was something completely new to

321
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,100
Congress which is not made up of

322
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,380
technologists thank you

323
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,520
so voice-over-ip

324
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,529
ended up having a very different

325
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,660
architecture than Congress had

326
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,210
anticipated and Skype was preposterous

327
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,760
ly different lots of other forms of

328
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:41,480
communications should these be covered

329
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:46,520
by Kalia how let's take a look at what

330
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:49,370
voice over IP well if I want to get

331
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,860
local phone service I'm dealing with a

332
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:56,440
provider who's physically present in my

333
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:00,730
town the maximum run of twisted-pair

334
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,710
more or less no matter what you do is

335
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,020
five or six thousand meters you can't

336
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:09,830
run the signal just will degrade too

337
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,270
much if you go past that range and the

338
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,060
very worst you have a remote

339
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,829
concentrator note to terminate the

340
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,920
analog signal convert it to bits or

341
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,510
amplified or somesuch

342
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,459
if I'm dealing with a VoIP provider I

343
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,589
don't have to know or care where the

344
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,779
provider is I'm connecting to them over

345
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:30,200
the internet on the internet everybody

346
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,689
is local so my voice provider could be

347
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,640
in another country one that's not

348
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,270
subject to US jurisdiction the person

349
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,589
I'm calling

350
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:46,040
might be a customer of a different voice

351
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,050
provider again in another country the

352
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,550
signaling messages I'm dialing a phone

353
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:55,219
number goes to my from me to my voyeur

354
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,579
to the recipients VoIP provider to the

355
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,700
recipient computer or phone that's one

356
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:05,900
path I can be sitting in an internet

357
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,819
cafe half a country away from my

358
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,459
residence dealing with a VoIP provider

359
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,829
in another country and the same could be

360
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,670
true of the person I'm going to talk to

361
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,970
where do you put the Kalia tap physical

362
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:25,309
proximity is no longer necessary you

363
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:28,280
know if a phone company in your town in

364
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,530
your County doesn't comply with Kalia

365
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,840
they can be fined and if they don't want

366
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,060
to comply the federal marshal can go

367
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,010
walk up to the door and they'll a big

368
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,600
sign to the door saying you

369
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,050
seized by order of US District Judge

370
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,090
so-and-so physical presence you got

371
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,190
means of enforcement you don't even have

372
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,260
a legal means of enforcement let alone a

373
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,500
a practical one against someone in the

374
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,420
country that doesn't want to cooperate

375
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,700
good luck trying to serve a US wiretap

376
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,500
order on a Russian VoIP provider or a

377
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,980
Chinese VoIP provider it's just not

378
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,350
going to happen where do you put the

379
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,390
Kalia tap the architecture doesn't work

380
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,370
anymore and even if you put the tap on

381
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,980
the switches and get the call set up

382
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,199
messages and messages the call itself

383
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,940
doesn't go over the same path the call

384
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,300
can go directly from one phone to

385
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,760
another over the to local ISPs you're

386
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:24,040
not gonna get the voice map different

387
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:28,210
facilities and then we had Skype which

388
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:31,480
FCC report called truly bizarre

389
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,040
architecture and it's original it's a

390
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,430
Microsoft has changed microphones Skype

391
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,899
they've changed the architecture for

392
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,760
their own reasons some people think it's

393
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,060
because they tried to make it easier for

394
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,129
the FBI to spy Microsoft's explanation

395
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,200
is to accommodate mobile phones I

396
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,240
suspected that's correct it was a

397
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,610
peer-to-peer network your calls are

398
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,450
being relayed over random other

399
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:58,250
computers on the Internet

400
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,890
do you trust this random on the computer

401
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,060
of your law enforcement to have the

402
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:08,720
kaliya software and to honor the wiretap

403
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,040
requests maybe but the next call is

404
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,560
going to go through somebody else's

405
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,550
random computer it doesn't work anymore

406
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,710
this architecture is not compatible its

407
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,870
end-to-end encrypted well we now know by

408
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,550
that from the Snowden revelations of the

409
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,250
NSA is managed to crack this but that's

410
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:29,659
a separate story there's no place to put

411
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,840
a kaliya like tap anymore so what do we

412
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,840
do

413
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,179
and beyond that there are lots of other

414
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,159
ways to communicate today well this

415
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,700
email which the FBI wasn't thinking

416
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:45,400
about 1994 even though it existed text

417
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,850
messages in all their variants snapchat

418
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,790
you want to go bug snapchat voice

419
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,760
communication in multiplayer games you

420
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,290
stopped fighting the dragon long enough

421
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,330
to today okay

422
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,629
the plot is on weekly at the corner of

423
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,540
3rd and main tomorrow it's a different

424
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:09,910
communication channel it's not covered

425
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:11,860
by Kalia voiceover I am systems you can

426
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,360
do this I can send text message over

427
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,300
Skype I can switch the voice I can

428
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,610
switch the video and more there more or

429
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,490
more ways to communicate none of which

430
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:24,189
are covered by Kalia Kalia was expanded

431
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,080
by order of the FCC upheld by federal

432
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,330
court I think incorrectly as a matter of

433
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,629
law but I don't get a vote on that to

434
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:35,189
cover local-access ayat links to ISPs

435
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,750
come on of the stuff is encrypted and

436
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:43,000
the real actions and the application

437
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:45,970
level so for the last several years the

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,780
FBI has been advocating changes to Kalia

439
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,670
to cover all these other services what

440
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,379
they want is for all communication

441
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:57,280
services or at least all of the major

442
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:00,700
ones to include a wiretap interface not

443
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,700
just phone switches but everything if

444
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,330
you're going to have a you know world

445
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:10,450
world of warcraft 17 or something and

446
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:14,020
that voice communication you put in a

447
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,630
Kalia interface text message service put

448
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,470
in a Kalia interface something I can't

449
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,210
comprehend to put in a Kalia interface

450
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,310
no bill has been introduced yet but the

451
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,170
FBI keeps going to Congress and say

452
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,210
we're going dark that's what they call

453
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:32,080
it the going dark problem we can't do

454
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:34,030
these wiretaps it's not clear how big a

455
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,290
problem this really is I just saw some

456
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,810
numbers this afternoon and haven't even

457
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,870
had a chance to fully digest them the

458
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,399
u.s. the FBI did think about

459
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:45,010
twenty-eight twenty-nine hundred wiretap

460
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,160
orders it's actually up for about the

461
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,510
usual average of about

462
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,040
mm 2100 about 40 of the calls were

463
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,990
encrypted and in nine to them they

464
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:00,379
couldn't break the crypto which means

465
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:05,060
that 31 of them they could but there

466
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,770
aren't huge numbers of wiretaps and but

467
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,330
the FBI says they going dark the FBI

468
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,100
will tell you oh we don't bother ask

469
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,649
them for wiretap when is something like

470
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,469
Skype or Apple FaceTime because we know

471
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,420
we can't crack it I can't say that one

472
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,160
way or the other I can say that the

473
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,890
wiretap numbers have been pretty

474
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:26,360
consistent from year to year there are

475
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,570
several problems with this notion of

476
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,129
kaliya tooth if you try to do it it's

477
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,020
going to drive up costs hinder

478
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,090
innovation and see the Internet service

479
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,170
market to other countries which were in

480
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:40,159
another country might think is a great

481
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:44,380
idea but the FBI won't how do you handle

482
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,830
all the countries access requests okay

483
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:51,020
FBI gets a request through the State

484
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,350
Department from the UK to go to tap some

485
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,660
suspected terrorists yep and probably go

486
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,620
along with that and now you've got a

487
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,240
request from Saudi Arabia for blasphemy

488
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,290
for China from China for supporting

489
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,550
Falun Gong and from Russia for

490
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:11,330
criticizing Putin or opposing the

491
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,460
kleptocracy well this is a I won't say

492
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,750
it's a harder call is very easy to say

493
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,030
what the State Department will think of

494
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:21,230
this but how do you architect how do you

495
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:25,850
designed a service that works in all of

496
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:27,800
these scenarios technically it creates

497
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,439
security problems much like we saw in

498
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Athens and Rome this is still software

499
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,020
but other than the fact that it won't

500
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,000
work it's a fine idea

501
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,040
you can't put a backdoor into

502
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,280
open-source software I can just imagine

503
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,990
okay here's my download of Ubuntu with

504
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,060
the official Kalia interface to my

505
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,860
network stack thank you this is open

506
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:53,690
sourced 27 comma 39 to leaked great

507
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,639
public key for the FBI

508
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,640
let me change a few digits in there

509
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:06,159
putting it in the server what server in

510
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:09,220
Skype its indent Skype Apple FaceTime

511
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,010
our end-to-end encrypted where do you

512
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,590
put the crypto on this server that could

513
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,929
be intercept on the server if you put it

514
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,470
on the end system might might not be

515
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:22,330
noticeable and how are you going to stop

516
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,940
people from downloading software

517
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,799
developed in other countries a lot you

518
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,299
don't doesn't take huge physical

519
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,220
infrastructures to develop software

520
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,290
there's lots of popular software

521
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,390
including I might add Skype that was not

522
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:40,899
developed in the u.s. originally in

523
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,940
hinders innovation Kalia is based on the

524
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,120
implicit assumption that there's a

525
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,850
trusted place to put the tap the local

526
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,889
phone company and phone companies have

527
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,990
historically been in bed with the

528
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,179
government because until not all that

529
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,400
long ago they were extremely highly

530
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:00,640
regulated especially local phone service

531
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,710
is still quite regulated innovative

532
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,900
designs don't handle don't have central

533
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,720
servers are you going to rule things out

534
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,580
if Skype were a real telephone and

535
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,740
traditional phone company they'd be one

536
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,530
of the largest international carriers in

537
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,240
the world it's completely transformed

538
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:21,100
the way people make international phone

539
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:25,470
calls but it would have been ruled out

540
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:29,080
had kaliya been a requirement if you

541
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,179
impose this requirement for a law

542
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,100
enforcement interface on the small

543
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,950
innovative companies that are developing

544
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,689
the new services you want to add a

545
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,150
tremendous amount to their code base

546
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,980
probably buggy code because they these

547
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,230
people are app developers not security

548
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,320
software developers and they're going to

549
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,370
rule out certain solutions and

550
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,470
developers and countries that don't have

551
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,299
such a law will get a market advantage

552
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,030
they can ship sooner they can ship

553
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:59,410
smaller leaner more correct code why do

554
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:02,309
you want to do that what countries

555
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,350
access requests do you live do you

556
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:08,200
exceed and how do you how do you enforce

557
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,679
this technically here's an example a

558
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,320
problem this headline wasn't yesterday's

559
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,060
York Times sign is Apple's hottest

560
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,429
iPhone marketing by the way that's where

561
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,060
the iPhones are manufactured if I'm

562
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,500
going to put a backdoor into iPhones

563
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,649
that's one of the requests I'll get to

564
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,800
in a moment how do I keep the Chinese

565
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,030
government from demanding similar access

566
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,600
do I really want you as business

567
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:37,340
travelers to China being that exposed if

568
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,020
I'm the FBI no of course not and it

569
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,060
creates security problems and as a

570
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,100
security and privacy guide this is one

571
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,649
of the more serious problems problems

572
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,110
from my perspective the existing

573
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:52,160
implementations are problematic at best

574
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:55,969
and these were done by skilled phone

575
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,920
switch developers a lot for large

576
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,050
corporations you don't whip up a phone

577
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,920
switch in your basement the code is too

578
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,600
complex you know back when I was working

579
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,760
to the switch developers it took

580
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,800
considerably more than a day to just to

581
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,350
do the compilation the code is that

582
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,750
complex and very specialized code I

583
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,560
might add you give a whole separate talk

584
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,720
on how you design a phone switch for

585
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,899
serious reliability for now I will say

586
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,650
that phone switch outages due to

587
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,480
software the same ballpark as switch

588
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,320
outages due to hardware and the hardware

589
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:37,850
is also reliable and replicated they got

590
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,590
the software that reliable the problem

591
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,750
you're trying to solve with Kalia is

592
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,790
much less well understood than making a

593
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,900
phone call we've known how to build

594
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:49,820
phone switches for about 125 years we've

595
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,950
known how to do electronic phone

596
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:57,710
switches for 35 to 40 years and by the I

597
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,740
might add the 1980s AT&T had a hell of a

598
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,090
bed probably trying to build a 5 ESS

599
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,920
that's a separate lecture one I'm

600
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,860
probably not allowed to give still for

601
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,950
my time at AT&T and these developers are

602
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,260
not security experts if their own Coke

603
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,240
product specific code is home developed

604
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,340
it will undoubtedly have more serious

605
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,450
security problems and the attackers

606
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,159
won't know how it works

607
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,200
the attackers figured out how the

608
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,380
Ericsson code worked and that was a much

609
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,640
fun

610
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,640
but other than all that adds a fine idea

611
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:35,389
we have another problem that's heated up

612
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:37,340
just in the last few months now rewind

613
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,649
again to the 1990s the other thing that

614
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:43,428
gotten me involved in public policy it's

615
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:46,010
called the crypto Wars in the 1990s and

616
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:49,010
be earlier export of cryptography was

617
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:53,179
restricted by US law it was a munition

618
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:56,570
you can't export tanks or missiles or

619
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:58,850
encryption algorithms nobody outside the

620
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:02,960
country is capable of reading the NIST

621
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:07,760
standard for AES and implementing it

622
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,380
right you needed an export export

623
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,299
license despite that of course people

624
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,330
somehow outside the US were managing to

625
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:17,210
do this or buying us parts that had it

626
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,189
and somehow managing to export it and so

627
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,740
the government pushed the notion is

628
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,120
known as key escrow embodied in

629
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,059
something called the Clipper Chip and

630
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,489
the notion was that anything encrypted

631
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:31,070
with this clipper chip would have extra

632
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,500
field attached to it that would have an

633
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,510
encrypted copy of the key that only the

634
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,570
government could decrypt and use that to

635
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,730
actually read the session it was

636
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,340
bitterly opposed by virtually every

637
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:46,399
technologist who called it inherently

638
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:48,709
horribly insecure I talked to a former

639
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,059
prosecutor she told me she was terrified

640
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:56,149
of it well thought you needed to go tap

641
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:58,158
phone calls of these drug gangs but she

642
00:29:56,149 --> 00:30:01,189
worked what she was working on no that's

643
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,789
exactly why I'm terrified of it the drug

644
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,950
gangs she felt had so much money and so

645
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,179
much force was so ruthless that they

646
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,610
were going to get through all the

647
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:13,130
safeguards and get into the database of

648
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,010
all these escrowed keys and be able to

649
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:18,080
listen to anybody else's calls she had a

650
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,820
tremendous amount of respect for their

651
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,418
power and their ruthlessness she was

652
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,309
terrified of clipper eventually the

653
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,380
government gave up gave up there was no

654
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,770
market they tried persuading people

655
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,350
there's no market they also saw jobs and

656
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,389
contracts going abroad to countries that

657
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,299
didn't restrict crypto exports

658
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:40,218
and they said we are losing not only

659
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:43,158
losing this war trying to win it is

660
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:50,059
hurting the economy so by 2000 it was

661
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:51,950
hard it's back in recent years

662
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,779
especially in the last six months or so

663
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,459
the FBI is been asking they don't want

664
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:59,359
to call it a backdoor anymore they call

665
00:30:55,459 --> 00:31:00,889
it a front door or a golden eye I can't

666
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,049
make this up that I'm quoting the

667
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:05,869
director of the FBI this is a golden key

668
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:07,729
to let only the good guys in I once

669
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:09,589
wrote an April first RFC on what's

670
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:11,389
called the evil bit any packets for

671
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:12,829
hacking have to have the evil bit said

672
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:14,928
therefore the firewall knows to drop

673
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:17,690
them that's about what they want except

674
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:20,959
they they want look hold the angelic

675
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,940
bitch this is a this requests coming

676
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:26,539
from the FBI only we can set this bit

677
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,859
let us in and they wanted not just for

678
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:33,169
communications but for devices you know

679
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:36,859
these iPhones are now strongly encrypted

680
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:39,259
and Apple can't break it even with a

681
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:42,559
warrant and this has the FBI horribly

682
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:47,359
upset as a hearing on Capitol Hill today

683
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,168
where you have law enforcement agents

684
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,059
warning of dire consequences if

685
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,799
something isn't done you also people

686
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:57,049
like my friend colleague Matt Blais

687
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,279
saying you can't do this it just doesn't

688
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:03,379
work technically the NSA and homeland

689
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,759
security of joined the FBI the NSA was

690
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,439
standing on the sidelines with the

691
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:08,659
Clipper Chip they designed it but their

692
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,339
heart really wasn't in it their enemies

693
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:12,769
we're not going to listen to us law and

694
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:14,779
by us devices so what would they have a

695
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:16,009
go figure out ways to work around it

696
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:20,450
anyway this time they're saying they

697
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:22,190
needed NIST also a government agency has

698
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,969
stated publicly that they think this is

699
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,159
a bad idea

700
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:27,679
so is virtually every other

701
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,599
non-government technologist and I

702
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,749
suspect a lot of people inside the NSA

703
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,129
I've heard have been published reports

704
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:35,389
that a lot of people inside the end as

705
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:41,059
they don't think this is that great an

706
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:43,728
idea either it will be buggy it will be

707
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,789
insecure in the international aspects of

708
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:49,179
anything war two

709
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:52,299
so what do we do about this how do we

710
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:55,869
solve the lawful access problem that the

711
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:58,059
FBI says they have how do they let them

712
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:00,340
get in if we cannot provide them with

713
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:05,110
kaliya if we cannot provide them with

714
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:07,749
golden keys I think the first question

715
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:11,590
is is there even a problem it is not

716
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:13,080
obvious some people say that this is

717
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,939
actually the golden age of surveillance

718
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,970
because newer services are creating a

719
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,619
vast amount of metadata that's a word

720
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,320
that's become very popular in the last

721
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:25,779
ten years thank you mr. Snowden it's all

722
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,299
the data about two communications who

723
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:29,080
calls whom is extremely useful to law

724
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,460
enforcement

725
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,199
even without the content but and these

726
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,090
newer services is creating a tremendous

727
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,490
amount of metadata Skype leaks IP

728
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,408
addresses even though it's end-to-end

729
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,749
encrypted is leaking like the addresses

730
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,129
and we're all carrying tracking devices

731
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:47,950
that they can use to track your location

732
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:52,509
at any time I'm sorry I call it a phone

733
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:55,389
they call it a tracking device in fact

734
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:56,759
they something called a tower dump local

735
00:33:55,389 --> 00:34:00,610
police officer will go to the local

736
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,809
wireless company and say here here's the

737
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,258
court order actually they usually don't

738
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:07,149
bother with the court orders they say or

739
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:09,429
if they get a very low-grade easy to

740
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,690
obtain court order and say tell me all

741
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,589
the phone numbers that were associated

742
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,579
with this tower during this period I

743
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:17,710
wonder how many of those being used

744
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:21,780
right now in Baltimore to find out who

745
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,780
was in a riot torn area at certain times

746
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:31,629
mobile phones a person specific you call

747
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:35,259
you rewind twenty years before mobile

748
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:36,399
phones were the norm you call somebody's

749
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,230
house you're gonna get their spouse

750
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,918
their kids the babysitter to the plumber

751
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,599
or maybe the target of interest the fact

752
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,509
they're actually law enforcement

753
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,700
procedures for what to do this they call

754
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,319
it minimization you have somebody

755
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,908
listening in on the call and they hear

756
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:53,770
the wrong person they stop recording for

757
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,569
a while he'll they start recording it a

758
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,150
couple of minutes later to see okay it's

759
00:34:55,569 --> 00:35:00,250
two mobster spouses chatting for

760
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,410
while before they turned the phones over

761
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,299
to the actual target to throw off the

762
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,440
FBI agents they're clever they'll come

763
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:09,339
back on in a couple of minutes to

764
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,539
wiretap some more mobile phone you're

765
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,788
probably the only one who answers your

766
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:17,289
phone you're certain to get the target

767
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:20,680
of interest cloud-based email services

768
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:22,779
like Gmail Yahoo Mail and outlook.com

769
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,359
make preservation of data a priority

770
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,059
they're really good at keeping data not

771
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,650
deleting it

772
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:35,680
the official claims of dire consequences

773
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,750
of we don't get rid of this secure

774
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,569
communication have not historically

775
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,799
proven true these nine encrypted calls

776
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:43,538
they couldn't break through that's

777
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:45,640
actually the first time I've heard a

778
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:50,289
number that's as highest nine usually

779
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:52,210
the number is about one maybe two so we

780
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:55,140
have not really seen the previous

781
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,480
predictions of doom and gloom come true

782
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:01,470
most criminals don't really cover their

783
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,630
tracks very well they're pretty stupid

784
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,609
the fact is I was actually the one time

785
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,299
I whenever went to oral arguments at the

786
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,049
Supreme Court

787
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:13,569
I heard Justice Scalia say and about

788
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:14,980
these words we've never held that the

789
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,930
police can't take advantage of the fact

790
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,210
that most crooks are stupid it's not a

791
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,348
principle of US law they don't say it

792
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,279
doesn't have to be a fair game in that

793
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:26,319
respect and when there is a target that

794
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:30,339
they're really interested in despite

795
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:33,038
strong cryptographic defenses like the

796
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:34,808
Silk Road they can take it down they

797
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,710
know how to do this is a question of the

798
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:40,990
effort they have to exert but suppose

799
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,250
there is a problem what should law

800
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,649
enforcement Jukes

801
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,490
so our proposal this is joint work with

802
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:51,329
the Matt blaze from Penn one of his PhD

803
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,339
students Andy Clark and Susan Landau

804
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:57,880
pressor cybersecurity policy at whisker

805
00:36:54,339 --> 00:37:01,869
Polytech our proposal is pack the

806
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,880
endpoints don't go through strong

807
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,819
security like the crypto go around it

808
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,670
hack the endpoints capture the

809
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:11,980
conversation before encryption or after

810
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,900
decryption install your tab

811
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,350
microphone driver that in the audio

812
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:22,600
driver what do you newer this crypto

813
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:24,700
stuff for or maybe just send out a few

814
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:30,100
extra packets with the session key

815
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:33,129
encrypted the FBI's public key is it

816
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,130
illegal for the FBI to hack can they do

817
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:42,160
it will this lead to more security holes

818
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:44,470
in our software in the u.s. the ability

819
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,109
of the FBI of any police agency to do

820
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,939
things like wiretap is governed by the

821
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:51,220
Fourth Amendment the text of which you

822
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,320
see me for you it turns out the Fourth

823
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,770
Amendment does not say police need a

824
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,990
warrant before they search it says no

825
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,270
unreasonable searches are allowed what

826
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,379
is reasonable what is unreasonable if

827
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,330
you have a warrant just by definition

828
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,070
reasonable although there are guidelines

829
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,140
saying warrants and generally cert be

830
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,150
served in 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.

831
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,549
waking hours I don't know about you I'm

832
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,030
not up at 6 a.m. but ok that's what we

833
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:19,500
will say and particularity particularly

834
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,500
described in what you want to seize

835
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:27,609
judges can and do issue court orders

836
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:30,280
saying you police officer so-and-so FBI

837
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:33,819
special agent so on so have the right to

838
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:37,450
hack this particular computer to find

839
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:41,590
this particular data why because this is

840
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:44,560
a way to carry out the search it's

841
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,960
probably it I don't believe that this

842
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,750
Authority has ever seriously been

843
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,400
challenged in court it would probably be

844
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,210
upheld even though there is no specific

845
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,880
statutory authorization for it it is

846
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:01,030
being done today we do suggest a new

847
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,130
statute along the lines of the wiretap

848
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,670
law which is called title 3 in the law

849
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:08,260
is big for the it's title 3 of the 1968

850
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:14,260
omnibus safe streets and Crime Control

851
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:16,780
Act title 3 disperse are the conditions

852
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,670
on which can be done wiretap for example

853
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,859
require what's known as a super warrant

854
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,619
you actually have to satisfy a bunch of

855
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,640
other conditions about why you should be

856
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:28,240
allowed to do something

857
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,308
there's a wiretap software intrusions

858
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,689
hacking is even more intrusive let's put

859
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:35,980
those conditions on it and is it

860
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,220
feasible I think that's the most

861
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:42,660
interesting question today's systems are

862
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,730
very buggy once a month on Patch Tuesday

863
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,069
Microsoft releases their patches almost

864
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,859
every month there are several critical

865
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:52,900
vulnerabilities you don't have to do

866
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:54,029
anything and getting but you get

867
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,440
infected

868
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:58,329
Microsoft is Bertram endless amount of

869
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,549
evidence security in the last dozen or

870
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:03,220
so years and a tremendous amount of

871
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:05,170
respect Windows 8 is probably the most

872
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,669
secure commercial operating system out

873
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:11,920
there and I'm a Mac user they still get

874
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,079
they still have critical vulnerabilities

875
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,960
almost every month and that's to say

876
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,700
nothing else a Adobe which has critical

877
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,700
vulnerability and flash about every week

878
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,970
there's a market for these things

879
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,859
so-called zero days whole switch no

880
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,259
patches exist it's not kind of an

881
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:32,589
underground market or a gray market it's

882
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:34,299
legal in the US but it's not talked

883
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:36,220
about very much most of the customers

884
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:40,029
are intelligence agencies from one

885
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,439
country or another but the intelligence

886
00:40:40,029 --> 00:40:43,720
agencies are buying so much it's not

887
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,400
gonna add very much demand to the market

888
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,368
law enforcement is not doing that many

889
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,809
tabs if government has to develop its

890
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:54,849
own the FBI already has a lab that knows

891
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:56,890
how to do things like this the domestic

892
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:59,170
communications Assistance Center they

893
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,299
can develop this software for local law

894
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,250
enforcement they can find the new holes

895
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:06,788
and integrate them into the actual

896
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,440
wiretap software the market for

897
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,000
vulnerabilities is big you get a nice

898
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,220
juicy vulnerability you can sell it for

899
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,950
six figures sometimes high six figures

900
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,578
there are rumors that iPhone holds zero

901
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:21,328
days go for $500,000 there's a guy named

902
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:23,950
Charlie Miller he used his ex NSA hacker

903
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:26,440
these days puts most of the energy into

904
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:30,700
hacking cars he's been quite successful

905
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:33,940
thank you he sold one vulnerability he

906
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,379
found four he won't say exactly how much

907
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,480
but probably six figures to an unnamed

908
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,339
and agency he's on the record as saying

909
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,740
this there's enough other evidence

910
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:44,869
supporting this claim some of these

911
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,399
people will sell to all buyers some will

912
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,170
sell only to governments they trust

913
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,339
someone sell to all buyers don't lie

914
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:56,630
about it you know it's not a you don't

915
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:58,430
buy this on the New York exchange here

916
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,140
are some numbers from a few years ago

917
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,868
today's numbers are probably very

918
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:07,279
similar about how many zero days were

919
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:09,950
found in every month you see large

920
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:13,309
numbers of zero days being found by

921
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:15,348
different organizations for being

922
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:18,440
reported and bug track these are not a

923
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:20,779
scarce resource yeah not all that we're

924
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,039
gonna be applicable to all people you

925
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:25,809
know you're not going to get into this

926
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,009
machine with a bug in Internet Explorer

927
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,509
you're not going to get in with a bug in

928
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:33,529
flash because I don't have to let it

929
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:35,240
anywhere near my computer our code is

930
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:40,369
still buggy our code will always be

931
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:43,220
bunny we're not going to hurt security

932
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:46,700
by using this lawful hacking the bugs

933
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:50,629
are already there we're not creating the

934
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,038
problem we're taking advantage of it and

935
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,410
in fact we want to fix it

936
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:56,660
we advocate a mandatory reporting

937
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,970
requirement when a government agency

938
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:03,348
learns of a zero-day it must report it

939
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:05,118
to the vendor promptly experimental

940
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:06,680
evidence indicates that they still have

941
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,869
the better part of a year to actually

942
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,419
use it before it was fixed in any

943
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:12,859
significant number of machines so even

944
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,839
if they report it immediately

945
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:19,098
they've got most to be here to use it

946
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:22,640
with more they get new one so when they

947
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:24,440
find this oh by this development they'll

948
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,129
report and they'll be a patch so it's

949
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,140
going to help security not hurt it and

950
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,180
most of the actual wiretap code is

951
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,359
vulnerability independent the code to

952
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,038
actually hook into the the audio driver

953
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,049
export the session key that doesn't

954
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,910
depend on a new hole that depends on

955
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,559
they released the operating system major

956
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,990
releases come about once every several

957
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,839
years and even then those interfaces

958
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,368
don't change much oh I need a different

959
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,770
zero day because Microsoft has patched

960
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,200
that

961
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,810
fine I'll use this Adobe one instead

962
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,859
plug it in get into the system the rest

963
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:01,440
of the code remains the same so how do

964
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,510
you do it you scan the target or the

965
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,090
target Network yeah you've got to allow

966
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:08,670
for nads and multiple devices and so on

967
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:12,420
you figure out the operating system and

968
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,860
software used okay this one my passive

969
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,300
fingerprinting suggests that this wants

970
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:21,120
a Mac it's calling out to Apple for

971
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:25,350
updates therefore it's a Mac oh that

972
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,609
one's packet formats time to live looks

973
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,819
like Windows fine

974
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,990
pull out the Microsoft code book to

975
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:34,020
select a vulnerability and build the

976
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:36,419
tapping package and install it however

977
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,540
you need to install a drive-by download

978
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,060
and effective attachment hack into it

979
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,860
directly from the outside maybe even a

980
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,070
black-bag job break it to someone's

981
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:52,230
residence plant it that way but that's

982
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:55,670
the easy part you don't want the bad

983
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,630
guys reusing this tapping code

984
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,340
especially especially you don't want

985
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,350
them finding out about you 0 days which

986
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:05,220
can be turned against you so you

987
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:07,920
obfuscate the code you strongly tied the

988
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:11,160
tapping package to the target machine if

989
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,290
you look at some of the military-grade

990
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,060
attacks by the way if you if you're

991
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,220
interested in that subject I highly

992
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,549
recommend Kim's Letters book on Stuxnet

993
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,620
countdown to zero day she described the

994
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,120
flame package he's related to Stuxnet

995
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,400
probably came from one of the same

996
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,830
intelligence agencies which seems to be

997
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,090
the you most people say it's the US and

998
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:37,860
or Israel and the actual payload of

999
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:40,410
flame is encrypted with values specific

1000
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,030
to the actual intended target machines

1001
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,250
so on some other machine it won't

1002
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:46,140
decrypt so it won't run see you hack

1003
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:49,140
into the machine no pull out a few

1004
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,180
important registry keys MAC addresses

1005
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,339
what have you and you encrypt your

1006
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,140
tapping package it spreads someplace

1007
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,650
else don't wonder can else can

1008
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,900
decrypted use the theorem techniques you

1009
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,360
know the software vendors are already

1010
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:07,110
using this on the commercial operating

1011
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,430
systems to tie a particular piece of

1012
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,750
commercial software to a particular

1013
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:14,640
piece of hardware I cannot I can pull

1014
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,190
some app off my phone give it you and

1015
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,100
your phone is not going to run is the

1016
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:23,610
same mechanism is it perfect no does it

1017
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,319
work well enough in most cases yes in

1018
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,600
fact you don't even need the

1019
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:32,150
vulnerability most of the time you use

1020
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:34,589
the vulnerability to get into a machine

1021
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,690
download the actual tapping software

1022
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:39,030
then erase the vulnerability exploit

1023
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,950
it's called the a loader dropper

1024
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,960
architecture it's well known in the

1025
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,899
malware world law enforcement can use it

1026
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,030
well so these standard techniques to

1027
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,960
conceal the actual vulnerabilities which

1028
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,930
are the things of most interest so the

1029
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:58,650
full picture law enforcement may be the

1030
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:02,520
private sector labs find holes develop

1031
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:04,050
the exploit tools new holes get reported

1032
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,560
to the vendor but then you've got you

1033
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:09,510
know 10 months or so when the need

1034
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,210
arises you get a scanning warrant from

1035
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:14,880
the judge at authorizing you to scan the

1036
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,920
targets network figure out the operating

1037
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,730
system the applications the versions and

1038
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:26,100
so on get a hacking warrant build your

1039
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:28,290
package and plant the wiretap code it

1040
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:32,160
doesn't introduce new security halls the

1041
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:34,920
way kaliya - or golden keys would it

1042
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,259
doesn't care about national boundaries

1043
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,810
could try to do this yes could rush it

1044
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,040
through this Israel France yes of course

1045
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:46,890
but they can do it today it's not hoped

1046
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,040
by the FBI doing it so the way a kaliya

1047
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:52,379
- would help these agencies the

1048
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,850
mandatory reporting element will help

1049
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:59,040
overall security the new law will first

1050
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,230
will require a public debates about do

1051
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,630
we actually want people doing this do

1052
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,370
want law enforcement hacking do we need

1053
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,329
a super warrant requirement we've never

1054
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:11,790
had that

1055
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:13,560
we should and difficult legal issues

1056
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,540
like how do you resolve the fact that

1057
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,640
I've hacked into a computer with the

1058
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,359
particularity requirement of the Fourth

1059
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,990
Amendment

1060
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:24,150
after all the requirement says maybe

1061
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,129
it's these files on a machine not

1062
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:28,230
everything on the computer the Supreme

1063
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:30,359
Court is already recognized in a case

1064
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,069
known as Riley that cell phones have a

1065
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,790
tremendous amount of sensitive

1066
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:38,910
information like nothing ever in history

1067
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:41,640
has had we need this particularity we've

1068
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:45,598
never had this debate this is a one way

1069
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,868
to do it so this is what we advocate

1070
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:52,500
don't weaken the internet with new

1071
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:56,190
requirements for new backdoors use the

1072
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:59,640
existing calls for hacking if you want

1073
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:02,700
more reading two papers by myself and my

1074
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,009
colleagues and a a more technically

1075
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:09,930
oriented paper called going bright and I

1076
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:12,420
Triple E security and privacy a legal

1077
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,368
and policy oriented one it's a law

1078
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,190
review article Law Review articles along

1079
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:20,310
this one's about 70 pages and one-third

1080
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,720
footnotes by volume new every factual

1081
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,630
statement in the Law Review article

1082
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,098
needs a footnote I believe that lawyers

1083
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:31,170
really wish they could put footnotes on

1084
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:35,160
their footnotes but I can't but this

1085
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:37,200
explores in fairly gory detail what some

1086
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,980
of these legal issues and requirements

1087
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,689
are this is white paper from CDT about

1088
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,240
Kalia - and even in New York Times

1089
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,280
editorial there's more recent stuff in

1090
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,589
the last very few months about crypto as

1091
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,349
I said there's a hearing on the hill

1092
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:54,720
going I went on today I'm looking too

1093
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:59,880
anxious to go see the news reports about

1094
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,189
what was said and done but I'm hoping

1095
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:06,460
that Congress will see sense on that and

1096
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:10,320
not try this really bad idea

1097
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,320
so questions please

1098
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:21,719
no questions we got some questions but

1099
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:23,789
the window why use a Mac instead of

1100
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:27,029
Windows many windows more secure I'll

1101
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:28,499
give you the answer for one thing I'm a

1102
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:30,390
lot more productive the purpose of the

1103
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:33,689
computer is not to be secure

1104
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:37,680
it's to do something I'm more productive

1105
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:39,150
on Macs and Windows Apple made decisions

1106
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,558
correctly that Microsoft made

1107
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,279
incorrectly just in terms of the user

1108
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,430
interface

1109
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,809
besides it's Unix underneath there's a

1110
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,259
shell in a command line and all the

1111
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:50,249
powerful UNIX tools and I can do crazy

1112
00:50:48,259 --> 00:50:52,199
pipelines with eager up and walk and all

1113
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:55,609
the other fun things that drive me crazy

1114
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:59,130
with their absence on Windows but I

1115
00:50:55,609 --> 00:51:04,170
tried to run it securely but being

1116
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:07,829
secure actually spaff is known for his

1117
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,209
line that using secure crypto in the

1118
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:11,039
internet it's like using an armored car

1119
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:12,808
to transport money from someone living

1120
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,989
on a cardboard box to someone sleeping

1121
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:19,140
on a park bench there's another way to

1122
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:23,489
justify this thing it's probably the

1123
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:25,410
most neighbors like yeah so you're

1124
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:27,479
talking about you know utilizing bugs

1125
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:31,109
for purpose other than basically

1126
00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:33,379
monitoring how common is it for how come

1127
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:35,308
is it to utilize you know bugs that were

1128
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,709
so-called bugs that were actually

1129
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:39,150
introduced into certain pieces of code

1130
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:41,640
and actually you stumbling upon

1131
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,619
something that you know probably bomb in

1132
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,779
other words is law enforcement actually

1133
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,599
pressuring vendors to introduce bugs

1134
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:52,769
there is no evidence for that one way or

1135
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:55,289
the other it is fairly clear that most

1136
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:56,640
companies would resist it's not less

1137
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:59,459
clear that they'd have the ability to

1138
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,009
it's not clear at all how much

1139
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:05,009
cooperation from Microsoft the NSA had

1140
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:07,279
when they found out how to crack sky we

1141
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:11,940
know from the Snowden revelations that

1142
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:14,190
the NSA has tried to sabotage crypto

1143
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:19,680
standards the evidence I'm sabotaging

1144
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:24,750
code I don't know any even the evidence

1145
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:27,529
of sabotaging crypto other than the dual

1146
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:32,040
see random number generator is

1147
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:34,710
exceedingly slim the strongest case

1148
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:38,730
could be made for des shortening the key

1149
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:41,310
length 256 bits and I can actually I

1150
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,200
could argue that one both ways that 56

1151
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,630
bitch was the right engineering number

1152
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,629
given the overall design of des the

1153
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:51,720
technology of the time this so I don't

1154
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:54,510
there's no evidence for the proposition

1155
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,299
that they deliberately sabotage for

1156
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:01,410
example the the heartbleed that existed

1157
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:03,450
that was found last April is there any

1158
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,129
evidence that you know that that might

1159
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,200
have been intentional that was just a

1160
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:11,280
bug that there's there's no evidence for

1161
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,220
it whatsoever it's very easily explained

1162
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,230
by cut and paste error and editing error

1163
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,689
yeah thanks though longer things like

1164
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:24,330
this can be done suddenly some years ago

1165
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:26,340
I won't say how many years I opened my

1166
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,870
morning newspaper and found that three

1167
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,730
people had just been arrested for

1168
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,710
hacking one of them was working on an

1169
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:35,820
important project that I was associated

1170
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:38,520
with oh boy so I went to management with

1171
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,110
this and I put together a repair

1172
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,810
permission and encouragement I put

1173
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,310
together an audit team to go look at the

1174
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,410
code base we knew when the person who

1175
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:50,970
joined the project we had good source

1176
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:54,720
code control system so we knew what we

1177
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:59,540
had to look at and we started doing an

1178
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:05,459
audit of the code I found one clear

1179
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:06,720
convincing security halt the commit logs

1180
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,760
showed who did it just meant other

1181
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,819
remember the audit team good friend of

1182
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:16,950
mine she said her reactions oh my god I

1183
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:20,100
put that did that simple bug but then I

1184
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:22,759
found some other code it was a

1185
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:25,920
combination of two independent bugs

1186
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,680
it's neither alone was the security hole

1187
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,920
the two bugs together plus a common

1188
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,919
misconception

1189
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:41,950
bugs but for various reasons that I will

1190
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:43,890
not go into that was very plausibly a

1191
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:50,169
cut-and-paste error

1192
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:51,640
so was this a very clever backdoor or

1193
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,200
did I just stumble onto something really

1194
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,040
improbable I think that's the most

1195
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,919
improbable bug I ever found to this day

1196
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,640
I don't know of the three people who are

1197
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,770
arrested one was one pleaded guilty one

1198
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:09,520
was acquitted and the third pleaded no

1199
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:11,980
contest so I'd like to this day I've

1200
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,100
encountered that individual since then

1201
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,510
at conferences and so on I do not know

1202
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,049
whether I've never had the nerve to ask

1203
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:22,510
if he left that in there deliberately

1204
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:27,130
but no I've not seen I've not seen any

1205
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:32,770
evidence for this proposition heartbleed

1206
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:36,670
I would have liked to have seen the

1207
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:37,780
commit blogs from the Apple source code

1208
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,760
control system

1209
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,490
I obviously they have one of those

1210
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,220
whether it's good or SVN or CVS or

1211
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:46,180
what-have-you but that's the only way to

1212
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,790
resolve it

1213
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,379
I don't not think that that was the

1214
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:54,580
White House is officially designed that

1215
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:56,440
that was planted I suspect I believe

1216
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:01,240
that it's it doesn't have the right feel

1217
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:05,070
to me and it hopes I'd OpenSSL such a

1218
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,069
horribly buggy piece of card anyway

1219
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,420
other questions

1220
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,019
did mention Dooley see it was actually

1221
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:17,900
one of these if you look at it

1222
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:21,848
simplistically it sounds like a really

1223
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:24,259
great way to put a backdoor into crypto

1224
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:27,349
after all it's really a public key

1225
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:29,359
algorithm the if you don't have the

1226
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:31,670
private key you can't decrypt it so it's

1227
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:34,970
not open to the door to the Chinese or

1228
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:36,170
the Russians only the NSA if you look at

1229
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:39,319
it that way you're looking at it

1230
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:43,309
incorrectly you have to look at it from

1231
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:47,058
a systems perspective it is not one

1232
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:50,480
person looking at an intercept and going

1233
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:52,630
over to the hsm the high-security module

1234
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:57,549
that's got the private key and saying

1235
00:56:52,630 --> 00:57:00,619
decrypt this for me it is a whole system

1236
00:56:57,549 --> 00:57:03,769
with many intercepts coming from many

1237
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:06,140
people too many analysts all of them

1238
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:07,609
have authorized access to this key which

1239
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,910
by the way has got to be replicated

1240
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:12,319
because you have just the one HSM and

1241
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,808
there's a hardware failure you lose the

1242
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,490
key you've lost all that careful

1243
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:18,230
engineering and you can never recover

1244
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:20,450
this private key either because if you

1245
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,640
can the Chinese and the Russians can so

1246
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:24,950
this key private key is backed up and

1247
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,680
there are a lot of people of legitimate

1248
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,269
ability to get at it do you trust every

1249
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,618
one of these people all the processing

1250
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:32,720
procedures necessary to get out

1251
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:35,210
especially when you roll it out beyond

1252
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,769
the NSA and give it to every

1253
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,079
law-enforcement agency in the country

1254
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:42,919
how do you secure the total system

1255
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:47,049
including the people including Edward

1256
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:49,759
Snowden's sister-in-law's cousins or

1257
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:52,549
spiritual sister-in-law's cousins who's

1258
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:55,160
going to do the same thing except it's

1259
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:57,460
not Edward Snowden doing there a leak

1260
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,430
for the public good it's someone like

1261
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:03,460
Kim Philby you know the name Kim Philby

1262
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:07,190
yeah you would

1263
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,740
Philby was a trusted senior US

1264
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:13,430
government official a lot of access in

1265
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:17,390
the CIA and mi5 and mi6 post-world War

1266
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:19,788
two he was also a Soviet agent and

1267
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:21,618
turned over everything juicy to the

1268
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,140
Soviets before he got word that they

1269
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:27,750
were on

1270
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:30,210
and defected what if yeah if your

1271
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,920
project for Noda the Soviets during

1272
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:34,109
World War 2 in their act shortly a

1273
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,079
little while thereafter we're reusing

1274
00:58:34,109 --> 00:58:39,598
their one-time pads which is a

1275
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,630
cryptographic nono to use the precise

1276
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,450
technical term and the NSA and its

1277
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:48,150
ancestor the Armed Forces signal

1278
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:50,730
Security Agency had discovered this and

1279
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:53,730
were able to break Soviet spy traffic

1280
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:55,769
because of this until Philby told the

1281
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:58,319
Soviets what was going on and that's

1282
00:58:55,769 --> 00:59:00,000
among the most closely-held things at

1283
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,650
the end is that the NSA could have had

1284
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,200
fill we could trade it the Soviets

1285
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:06,809
caught on and we called all those

1286
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:10,769
one-time pad and issued new ones how do

1287
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:12,750
you know that some spiritual descendant

1288
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:15,118
of kim Philby is not in the NSA right

1289
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:17,339
now as one of these authorized analysts

1290
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,710
you don't know that you have to look at

1291
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:22,019
this as a system it's not individual

1292
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:24,299
components is a system a system of

1293
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:26,519
communication a system of key management

1294
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:30,599
a system intercept the system of correct

1295
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:33,328
analysis or lawful access if you don't

1296
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,299
look at it that broadly you will not

1297
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:46,619
understand the problem all of this is an

1298
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:49,769
issue yeah it's got one way to left it

1299
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:51,869
says let's talk quickly so I think it

1300
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:53,368
came out in the Snowden leaks that NSA

1301
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:56,210
and other security agencies collect

1302
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:59,190
these zero days to kind of target

1303
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:01,680
international targets or specific high

1304
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:04,079
interest targets so don't you think like

1305
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,410
keeping that whole wiretap issue aside

1306
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,420
that particular statute to kind of

1307
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:11,038
report these to the vendors should be

1308
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,339
put in in in the law

1309
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,710
absolutely absolutely it's difficult to

1310
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:19,019
enforce be easier to enforce if it was

1311
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,119
part of the total wiretap solution it's

1312
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:25,950
one of the reasons we advocate a new law

1313
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:28,109
to formalize legalized regularize the

1314
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:31,379
hacking process but also to ensure the

1315
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:33,150
reporting to improve security

1316
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,120
remember important securities a crime

1317
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:37,770
prevention mechanism a national security

1318
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,250
advantage as well so it all goes

1319
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,009
together

1320
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:43,050
and now we're at it now we're off the

1321
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:46,490
air I'm happy to stick around and answer

1322
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:46,490
more questions but we're off the air
