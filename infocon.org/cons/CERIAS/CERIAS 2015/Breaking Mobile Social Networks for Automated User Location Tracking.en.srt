1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,090
come to the serious security seminar

2
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:27,859
it's my great pleasure to introduce

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,500
today's speaker a doctor Cragen octagon

4
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:35,780
is a societal of computer science and

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:38,000
engineering at the suny buffalo and he's

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,970
also the director of the ubs AG lab

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,309
there his research spans security and

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,559
networking including cloud in

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,690
outsourcing security wireless and Weber

10
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,750
system security and human centered

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:56,599
computing and professor ready the

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,570
recipient open as a career award in 2011

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,269
and number of other award and today

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,089
he'll talk about breaking mobile social

15
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:08,270
network thanks for the introduction

16
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,490
today I'm really glad to be here to

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,189
share one of the our recent studies on

18
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,770
the mobile social network security the

19
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,419
title of this tub is breaking mobile

20
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,939
social networks for automatic user

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,740
location tracking and here's the apply

22
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:27,380
of the top are we're going to start by

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,818
introduced by introducing the current

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,420
location information management

25
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:34,399
practices in the today's our mobile

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,119
social networks and then we will move on

27
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,850
to the attacks that we identify which we

28
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,270
which enable us to our check the use of

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,158
occasions and then we will move on to

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,048
how we can now get the attack in the

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,569
real world setting and report the

32
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,399
experimental result and then if we have

33
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,549
time we'll talk a little bit about the

34
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,829
defense mechanisms and then the targets

35
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:03,560
concluded so mobile social networks so

36
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:06,458
they are so popular nowadays with the

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,170
ubiquity of the smartphones right and

38
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,840
paintings of users are activating using

39
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,929
them for social interaction

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,470
DNA bases and the verse except for

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,410
examples include Facebook and reach and

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,540
Google+ was have something so far and

43
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,430
location-based information are really

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,310
important in this mobile social networks

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,400
because they are key to the user

46
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,239
interaction experiences in many networks

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,040
today and this location information in

48
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,670
level and facilitated a lot of

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,099
location-based social interactions and

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,220
here are a few examples that we look at

51
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,260
it so well the location information are

52
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,959
being used in the social networks for

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,760
example checking services so allow users

54
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,340
to checking in to report their locations

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,030
because I'm balls include festival wave

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,640
or four squares foursquare etc and

57
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,709
geotagging right and when you post a

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,958
message there's a location information

59
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,410
is being attached to that a particular

60
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,480
message and the examples also there are

61
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,099
also very popular in different mobile

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,470
social networks and there are also

63
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,810
location dependent comments for example

64
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,180
in the case of year when you visit a

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,739
particular restaurant and you leave your

66
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,489
comments that basic issues that you

67
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,410
happy to that exact place and also most

68
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,750
popularly proximity-based friend

69
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:33,720
discovery associate discovery and that

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,459
is focus of this research and before we

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,340
conduct the research and the first

72
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,280
question we ask also updates that how

73
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,590
does how do the existing location-based

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,989
mobile social networks and quiet user's

75
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,120
location and how do they get the user

76
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:54,609
location so basically the approach is as

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,620
expected by everybody else right mobile

78
00:03:54,609 --> 00:04:00,310
users voluntarily report their location

79
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,760
we have the client-side app to the avn

80
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,590
service providers and there are various

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,450
types of location information being

82
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,840
collected depend on the availability at

83
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,959
the time being right it include Wi-Fi

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,180
signal if they are available or GPS if

85
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,959
you are in the apt or apartment and you

86
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,270
have a GPS chip and also in your etawah

87
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,540
ID right and this different location

88
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,030
information they have different

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,610
Teresa's the Wi-Fi these are the numbers

90
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,909
we cite it from the references the Wi-Fi

91
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,610
maybe gives you a 80 meters range of

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,430
accuracy and GPS give you a run 10

93
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,410
meters of range and while the cellular

94
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,500
tower I the cables you are very

95
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,020
consequent information around 600 meters

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,840
and they are being collected you know

97
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,060
theoretical a moment autumn combined

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,190
fishing right and there are different

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,260
ways to obtain from those information

100
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,840
sources well involved in the studies

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,480
that we look at the different service

102
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,599
providers the beach and the sky sky out

103
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,730
basically select the available one with

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,670
the highest precision right by

105
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,000
interactive is enjoyed our framework so

106
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:13,730
program gps Wi-Fi or cid depend on at

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,460
that time being at that time what kind

108
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:20,300
of location information is available but

109
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,419
the apps like Momo does not allow you to

110
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,770
direct a request from the system but it

111
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:30,320
rely on certain SDK in most particular

112
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,229
cases right on by those locations DK to

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,099
fuse the input from different location

114
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:40,610
sources so then we want to know how

115
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,550
accurate the displayed use of location

116
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:47,030
information in the apps right suppose

117
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,430
the abscess the location is the one uses

118
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,390
the locations at a certain place but how

119
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,730
accurate it is if this already you know

120
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,590
adding a lot of noises maybe the users

121
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,210
are already better off because the

122
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,630
locating any their accurate location

123
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,419
informations not being displayed okay in

124
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,030
the system so we want to study that we

125
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,780
fear that okay this location accuracy it

126
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,059
is played in the client app we it can be

127
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,359
reflected by the distance between the

128
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,300
users real physical location and the

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,810
display the location you obtain that

130
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,060
indicated by the app right so we found

131
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,400
that location accuracy varies across

132
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,620
different air be essence and they are

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,030
depend on two things right first of all

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,280
the available location information

135
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,719
sources at that for example in that

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,150
moment you are indoor and

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,640
you only have Wi-Fi connection probably

138
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,030
you know it is nessa great when you are

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,000
up after and you have a gps signal it

140
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,789
also depends on heavily on the internal

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,820
processing strategy okay as we were shoe

142
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,620
sorel experiment how different apps

143
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,830
treat the location will mention in a

144
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,290
different way but the observations that

145
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,620
the OBS and location readings are still

146
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,800
high that grid and here's the accuracy

147
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:12,870
testing we did our towards several

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,670
unpopular FPS ends and the way we do it

149
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,800
then we want to study the difference

150
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:21,360
between the rear distance of the two

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,680
devices okay versus to the distance

152
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,180
readings on the popular different apps

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,180
okay so basically what do we did that

154
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,570
when you first run two instances of the

155
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,540
same lbs and so is in two different

156
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,669
virtual machines and then we fix one

157
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,710
reference point in one instance and move

158
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,789
another test point a lot on straight

159
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,739
line so that we know how we move the

160
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,100
distance so that we have the ground

161
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,660
choose and then we refresh the app and

162
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,630
refresh the status and we try to

163
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,360
identify the readings we try to read the

164
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,520
readings from there and we compare the

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,470
two and we will try to find the

166
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,150
difference and obviously in the ideal

167
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:08,790
case they are should they should be the

168
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:14,849
same however in reality they are not and

169
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:19,320
their varied across different apps so

170
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:22,229
here's a the result we found ok so this

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,240
three figures use the experimental

172
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,500
result we did form almost out and

173
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,870
recheck and here the result first form

174
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,719
almost case the distance readings are

175
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,530
always run it at five meters so that's

176
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,750
basically to say that if it's used five

177
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,329
meters away from each other you are the

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,390
registrants is anywhere between zero and

179
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:49,070
five if the choose 10 is anywhere

180
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,140
between 6 and 10 that is the most

181
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,800
situation

182
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,260
and then you look at the scala sky up so

183
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,920
sky out basically runs up the distance

184
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,560
reading every one mile okay so that

185
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,130
basically says that if it says you guys

186
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,949
are two devices are two miles away from

187
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,939
each other the register is anywhere

188
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:17,050
between more than one to two miles okay

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:20,530
and also the Scout impose a minimal sort

190
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,020
of distance our accuracy that any user

191
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,959
any two devices whose distance is

192
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:30,160
smaller than 0.5 miles it's just stop

193
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:33,220
there okay so if the registers between

194
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,270
two devices are between 0 and 0.5 it

195
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,630
always indicate at 0.5 so that's the

196
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,520
case for Scott so you so basically you

197
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,480
look at the figure if you can this

198
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,870
staircase and you know which end

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,250
case are we found the two

200
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,900
characteristics first of all the

201
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,680
location precision the distance

202
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,850
precision run did at every hundred

203
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,640
meters ok so if following the same logic

204
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,250
right so if the two devices indicated to

205
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,860
be 100 meters away from each other the

206
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:14,470
real distance is anywhere between 0 and

207
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:17,920
100 meters and also yes are they doing

208
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,410
it for privacy protection so they round

209
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,500
it off or they actually don't get the

210
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,219
accurate data yes we were talking more

211
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,230
flow net direction neta so but which had

212
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,330
also imposed another constraint

213
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,500
basically in the metropolitan area it

214
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,440
does not indicate any user that are

215
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,130
further away than one kilometers okay in

216
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,650
the rural area that number increases to

217
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,350
lie to us three kilometres okay

218
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:50,020
depending on the population density so

219
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,610
that's another that's the practice that

220
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:56,170
we find for animal Vijay so next we want

221
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,150
to find out how are the location

222
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,990
information being shared among FBS end

223
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,370
users okay do we we did a lot we did a

224
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,040
long list of

225
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,770
way and we basically characterize them

226
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,740
into three broad categories the first if

227
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,189
we call it open direct access to any

228
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,920
registered users of the app okay so

229
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,750
sharing exact location location

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,990
information among any users of the same

231
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,510
app okay so basically there's no

232
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:29,680
location privacy at all as long as you

233
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,980
are winning to using that okay the other

234
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,020
one is called authorized directed says

235
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,730
so basically you unleash sheer you share

236
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,490
you still share exact location

237
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,550
information of the users but only amount

238
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,880
authorized users cannot any other use of

239
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,740
the app but they are friends i only

240
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:53,320
share the exact location information

241
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:57,880
among friends and then we called another

242
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,910
type is in direct access this constraint

243
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,089
so basically in many cases the exact

244
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:08,199
location of the users and never disclose

245
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:12,010
a lever display but they shoot through

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,630
an obfuscated away and the common

247
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,760
practice is to choose the relative

248
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,100
distance between the two devices instead

249
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,550
of the exact location of a particular

250
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:26,190
device and on top of that it's subject

251
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:29,229
to various additional constraint and

252
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,270
this is a simplified the severe result

253
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,630
right and and in the paper we have a

254
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:39,459
welcome exhaustive list so you can see

255
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:41,860
arm in the eye around app which has at

256
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,959
the time of being sweat I they have ten

257
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,110
millions of users it has opened direct

258
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,170
access to the exact location information

259
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,420
okay in the Google+ and Facebook they

260
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,510
have authorized a direct access sharing

261
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,459
exact location among users but in the

262
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,800
case of beachheads count and momo de

263
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:03,849
pesca they'd never share the exact load

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:09,069
user location so they but then they have

265
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:11,140
a lot of our users so here's a closer

266
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,430
look on the constrained in direct access

267
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,430
you have the essence so

268
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,590
first of all showing the relative

269
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,780
distance between the users ok Momo

270
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,670
displays relative distance with the

271
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,370
precision of five meters as we just

272
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,469
pointed out through the experiment right

273
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,690
and you see their distance to other

274
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,960
users instead of exact location and

275
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:38,290
that's sort of the way you know you

276
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,990
enable location based services but you

277
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,750
somehow also protect users privacy as

278
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:49,470
they expect as they want ok and the

279
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:52,210
service rather one and on top of that

280
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:56,170
not only we just show the relative

281
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:59,650
distance but we also want to impose more

282
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,990
strict limits so that we can why

283
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,610
preserve the utility right meaning in

284
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,860
about the location-based the services

285
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,140
still we want a better protecting over

286
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,840
the user's location promising so scarred

287
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,180
skype scout basically impose an

288
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,230
additional constraint saying that when

289
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,800
two users are smaller than ours 0.5

290
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,440
miles away from each other we just stop

291
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,630
there ok we never indicate any distance

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:31,570
smaller than their 25 miles ok so um and

293
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:34,090
every time the precision is at one mine

294
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:38,260
ok that's one of the additional

295
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:40,420
constraint that scalp considers and the

296
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,750
other one is imposing a maximum distance

297
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,640
constraint in the beach head case any

298
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:51,820
user that is one kilometres away from

299
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:54,100
you so it is not indicated in the app ok

300
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,210
of course in the precision in the

301
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,830
beachhead case is 100 meters so he that

302
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:05,110
sort of survey and analysis pronounces

303
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,090
the following observation right so the

304
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,610
current I obeisance they rely on

305
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:12,490
indirect and constrained location

306
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,610
sharing ok so that exact user location

307
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,860
information never shared among users

308
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,740
such so that they want to strike a

309
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,890
utility and privacy trade-off ok and

310
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,250
this these are the current industry best

311
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,980
practices ok so it's deemed by most

312
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,810
popular

313
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,880
there be a sense as a desirable middle

314
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,770
ground for protecting both the location

315
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,470
privacy why you never need fective

316
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:41,120
location-based services okay that's our

317
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:43,100
observation so now we want to move on to

318
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
the attacking part so we're basing your

319
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,010
said that kind of protection is not good

320
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,460
enough at all and we can easily attack

321
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:56,060
it so here's the attack goal and some

322
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,330
change so we assume only a very weak

323
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,729
outside the other vessel okay so heavy

324
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,420
exactly the same privileges as ordinary

325
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,660
users and we do not pack into the lbs

326
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,180
and service provider their servers we

327
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,930
don't we just treat the service as a

328
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,770
black box okay so we only exploit the

329
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,439
public available information okay and

330
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,900
yet such an adversary is still able to

331
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,640
achieve both localizing an arbitrary

332
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,590
user with very high accuracy and

333
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,780
performing long-term shrinking and

334
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,220
eventually try to reveal the user's

335
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,069
identity information it's high

336
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:38,930
probability and that's the goal and the

337
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:41,960
assumption and then we start to describe

338
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,359
the text so first the attack targeting

339
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,360
so we have like two different types of

340
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,820
targeting right so first is selectively

341
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,110
targeting so you know a particular user

342
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,270
ID and you want check him or her okay

343
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,700
the attacker is able to look look at a

344
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,490
user if he knows the users ID for that

345
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,210
particular app right the attacker does

346
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,069
not have to be the victim sprint for

347
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,810
example in the more more distance

348
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,939
readings can be retrieved when the

349
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:15,020
attacker searches the victim by user ID

350
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:17,960
and in Scout the attacker sends a

351
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,910
regular message to the victim okay not

352
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,530
necessarily his friend the relative

353
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,740
distance will display it for the

354
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,800
following quarries okay and they also

355
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,910
random targeting right so you just set

356
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:35,240
your gps location in arbitrary van and

357
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,910
you search people nearby and you select

358
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,970
whatever use ID shoes up

359
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:45,090
okay so within a certain range that's

360
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,790
the way you do the test targeting okay

361
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,830
then the attack overview so we focus on

362
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,950
forming clients I tab located on the

363
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,110
user's mobile device okay and we divide

364
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,150
my automated system which can be easily

365
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,479
scared up to handle multiple concurrent

366
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,910
the targets right and basically the way

367
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,640
we do it and we exploit the localization

368
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,740
Service protocols to fake the locations

369
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,310
of the egg points that controlled by the

370
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,990
advisory okay and modify the android

371
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,110
framework to tamper the location

372
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,540
readings to and inside the the essence

373
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:22,740
and this picture on the right basically

374
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:28,050
shows that the attack logic and and we

375
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:30,030
run the out the mobile app mobile social

376
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,370
network service apps inside the Android

377
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,820
virtual machine okay this attack logic

378
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,370
basically calculate the fake locations

379
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,179
and updated and fit that information to

380
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,739
the app and your multiple run fashion so

381
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,080
that eventually it will converge and

382
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:51,170
when it converges are put the X painted

383
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:55,439
at a location and the tech logic is is

384
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:58,650
simple and this not does not have to be

385
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,670
fancy so the key idea trilateration

386
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:05,610
right for example moment use relative

387
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:09,960
distance between two users right so

388
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:12,330
suppose this star is what we want to

389
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,670
localize the user okay your particular

390
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:21,210
location so obviously if ice if I have

391
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:24,030
three other points both all of them

392
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,310
showing this user is visiting their

393
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,500
range the relative distance saying that

394
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:33,929
this is two miles this is 3-5 miles then

395
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,210
this child a duration will gives you a

396
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,670
good idea about the exact location of

397
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,770
the user and of course it is not

398
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,840
accurate enough when you just do a one

399
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,940
run thing so you do it your multiple

400
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,840
renovation and try to convert the

401
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,250
eventually you will have a very good at

402
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,570
estimating about user's location

403
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:58,060
and let's mess the starting point and

404
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,760
then to further deal with that the

405
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:04,780
minimum accurist constraint Scott Baker

406
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,270
says at any distance smaller than 0.5

407
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,510
miles we are not going to indicate that

408
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:13,060
so in that case we will basically issues

409
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:18,120
the specs petition with the ideas still

410
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:21,399
straight forward right if the users see

411
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,550
another user is the attack that the

412
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,970
victim that is visiting smaller than

413
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:34,600
zero conf I saw that user with zero a

414
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:38,320
smaller than 0.5 miles even know the

415
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:43,719
victim is anywhere inside this blue

416
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:50,439
circle right and fine update his own

417
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:52,750
location and check if he sees the check

418
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,060
if the location reading is we how the

419
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,570
location region is being changed he he

420
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,659
will know that which area that look that

421
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:05,649
victim is so you keep changing your own

422
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:10,140
location and you eventually you will not

423
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,140
I'm sorry it's just a little bit delay

424
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,090
now eventually you will be further

425
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,060
narrowed down the location of the victor

426
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,639
so basically you use a child adoration

427
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,060
to get a rough estimation of the earth

428
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,240
Victor and then use specs petition to

429
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:48,970
further narrow down your target and of

430
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:51,320
course to do with the the beachhead

431
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,380
additional constraint basically said end

432
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,379
user further than one kilometers away

433
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,500
from you is not showing in your friend

434
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,170
list in that case you just to have a

435
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,710
good estimation about where the victim

436
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,990
is and try to scan the whole area ok so

437
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:13,280
let's also straightforward of course

438
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:16,970
then if you have a good estimation about

439
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,889
where the victim is it will simplify

440
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,900
your effort right then but if you are

441
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,690
going to search our global basis that

442
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,440
converge time will be much longer ok

443
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:30,080
uncle then last December I described I

444
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,200
visit the one of the research institutes

445
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,060
d in China and they follow out followed

446
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,910
up our work basically they said that

447
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,340
they deployed a large number of virtual

448
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,950
machine instances institutions as a

449
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,740
different location the form up like a

450
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,740
grid system covering let's say the whole

451
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,229
Chinese life area right so that it gives

452
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,870
it good so you that when you try to

453
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,240
locate a particular user ID it takes

454
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,389
much less time because you already have

455
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:08,080
those watch a machine oh those instance

456
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,080
instances being running ok

457
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:19,730
okay now is about system implementation

458
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,699
right so the attack in logic runs inside

459
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:27,110
the host machine okay and we also run

460
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,440
the the the mobile social network app

461
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,780
inside the Android virtual machine and

462
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,090
we also write the location faker app

463
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,760
running inside the Android virtual

464
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,939
machine so the attack logic basically

465
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,740
carries out the localization

466
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,780
calculations okay and communicate with

467
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,780
the location tracker app in the virtual

468
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,450
machine to set fake locations and chick

469
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,000
also trigger location update operations

470
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,460
right because you have to simulate the

471
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,830
user's input right either the screen

472
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,430
dragging or you know scrolling down and

473
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:04,610
all that operations and also reading the

474
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,860
information from the android adb logs

475
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:12,020
try to extract the location information

476
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,629
in a teacher of a man so the location

477
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,990
faker amp universal machine self effect

478
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,450
locations by first use android smoke

479
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,640
location provider because i enjoyed for

480
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,790
the debugging purpose android system

481
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,070
allows it right act as a location server

482
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:32,149
that answers the location requests from

483
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:35,810
the social network app and there are two

484
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:38,660
different ways when does the FPS NM

485
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:41,929
requested information as we introduced

486
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,180
earlier so first of all the first type

487
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,340
is that the request the basically trying

488
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,520
to get location from android system

489
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,580
right so in that case we implement this

490
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,379
test location provider and feed the app

491
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,389
with the arm with the fake location or

492
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:03,740
in the case of mobile they they use by

493
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,690
dou s sdk so they try to corey use that

494
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,880
API to corey the location will mention

495
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,490
asked by the saying that oh hey where is

496
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,280
my location right in that case we

497
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,050
implement this infernal colonel firewall

498
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,450
called IP table right that's already

499
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:21,549
there we just use it to intercept the

500
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:24,519
network Chevy and redirect that

501
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:29,700
back by feeding outfit location to the

502
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:32,499
the time kinda so here are more details

503
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,330
right so enjoyed system allows setting

504
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:36,519
month location we have the test location

505
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,939
provided for the top debugging purpose

506
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:42,519
and our location faker implements a test

507
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,929
location provider so location faker can

508
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,480
accept the request from the attacking

509
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:52,509
logic unit and updated occasions so

510
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:57,669
whenever you want you are okay so the

511
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:59,830
computer is a little bit delayed than

512
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:05,049
expected so you better fit perfect

513
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:07,090
location to that so in the arm momos

514
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,690
case because they use location API to

515
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,488
Corey for the location so basically we

516
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,009
use the firewall to intercept the

517
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:18,509
traffic and redirect that and fit the

518
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,509
app its effect location

519
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,090
ok

520
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,639
so reading locations from the ABS

521
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,949
because when you implement system so the

522
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,260
you will see that all the text related

523
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,510
information is displayed in a widget

524
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,370
called textview provided by the android

525
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:43,530
framework and the vigil has an interface

526
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:46,350
textview dot said text which is caught

527
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,720
by the apps to choose a text and so you

528
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,030
from the screen you try to extract that

529
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,850
smaller than 0.5 my information

530
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,990
digitally so you might be modified the

531
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:01,590
code and love them basically to the

532
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:04,140
a.d.d log buffer so in that case we get

533
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:08,149
all the digital information of the

534
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,150
location information store

535
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,770
and the location update of operation in

536
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,689
the app consists of multiple tapping

537
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,389
dragging due to the screen size of the

538
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,460
mobile device and we have to we have to

539
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,030
be able to simulate this input to

540
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:32,550
refresh the location of that ok because

541
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,470
we want the automated approach we run

542
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:41,040
the app inside the virtual machine and

543
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:43,440
we also mimic the screen scorning with

544
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,420
multiple Jack studio visit alum user

545
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,890
list to read back all the distance

546
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:54,180
readings and that that is also important

547
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,870
and that's basically the attack overview

548
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,270
and the the the system implement

549
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:03,300
implementation aspect about that time so

550
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:08,280
here's we move on to the attack

551
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:10,080
experiment so basically we perform those

552
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,750
three big long evaluation with certain

553
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,840
volunteers from China Japan us we focus

554
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:18,000
on first the tracking accuracy right we

555
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,370
did both synchronous checking and a

556
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,070
synchronous drinking and we want also

557
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:26,459
want to know the localization efficiency

558
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:28,139
right and the effectives of the non term

559
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,490
tracking we also give it a little bit of

560
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:35,190
that so the first part is synchronous

561
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,130
change it basically said well we want to

562
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,920
roll up the inference from the users

563
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,650
mobility you just want to know how what

564
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,020
what is the best result we can get so we

565
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,080
because these volunteers we recruit

566
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,050
they're basically we write a little

567
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,240
crunches recording app inside their

568
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,790
phone right so they record their exact

569
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,970
location all the time right and then we

570
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:02,040
draw attack and we try to localize them

571
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,610
and we compare the two because you have

572
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,889
to have the ground choose to compare

573
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,129
ways and when you report your location

574
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:14,120
you stop there and wait until the tag

575
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:18,000
completes so that we know that this is

576
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,889
the best and then the time we will do we

577
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,780
do not prevent the user from movie

578
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:28,030
okay so the user refresh the location

579
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,010
readings on the app and report the odd

580
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,290
occasion to the server now attacks over

581
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:35,160
right and upon receiving a report server

582
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:38,129
done should i attack immediately and

583
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,380
when you get the result you compare and

584
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,270
this figure passing shoes in the time

585
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,640
domain this action how these actions

586
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,560
have you know you can sequential manner

587
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,080
and the accuracy is measured as a

588
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:57,399
distance between the in for the location

589
00:29:50,080 --> 00:30:00,970
and the user's relocation okay then we

590
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,300
wish you this result we find that is a

591
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:06,670
fairly accurately we just this pictures

592
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,860
may not be that clear but just from the

593
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,350
result in the moon was case sixty

594
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:16,479
percent of users can be found with the

595
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:19,659
accuracy of 0 to 20 meters ok so if use

596
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,830
so basically if we say this user is here

597
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:27,790
it is amazing like 20 meters range sixty

598
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:31,620
percent of the chances okay and this is

599
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:35,580
basically what we did and some of the

600
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:39,850
result when we did the experiment and

601
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:43,330
you see some tail on statistics this

602
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:47,590
because it's a reality when user and we

603
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:51,040
found that it may be because of depend

604
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,780
on the availability of the location

605
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,240
information sometimes we rely on Wi-Fi

606
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,210
sometimes we rely on GPS some time you

607
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,810
rely on Eid and these students sometimes

608
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:07,060
they use subway in all day they may use

609
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:09,129
different transportation approach so an

610
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,960
asynchronous check-in basically is that

611
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,070
we want to know in reality when we do

612
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,410
not we do not enforce any mobility

613
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,840
constraint on the user and how where we

614
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,990
can do right now where we can perform so

615
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,570
we basically in that case we just again

616
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,300
use that ground choose recording app it

617
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:31,629
don't get it on the user's phone to pee

618
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,980
erratically report their relocation okay

619
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,679
and then we launched the attack also

620
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,260
theoretically at a lower frequency and

621
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,510
whenever we get the result we compare in

622
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,429
the time domain which are the close to

623
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,309
the page information we compare the

624
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:49,910
distance another way users moves all the

625
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:53,870
time okay we do not interfere with their

626
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:56,600
mobility pattern so the volunteers carry

627
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,459
an app that automatically report

628
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,678
location theoretically attacks are

629
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,500
scheduled at lower frequency and again

630
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:07,520
we measure the distance between the in

631
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,880
for the location and the real location

632
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,770
and we found out the result of course

633
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,650
the performance degraded but this

634
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,860
gracefully for the most case previously

635
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:21,140
as I said six percent of chances but now

636
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,709
is forty percent of chances and that's

637
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:28,370
depend on wtt pattern that we the

638
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,980
volunteers have okay some of them they

639
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,020
are working so they do not know change

640
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,049
the accuracies high but if we take the

641
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,470
subway there will be a different issue

642
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:41,660
okay and for the time efficiency bike we

643
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,450
found that eighty percent of attacks

644
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,610
takes less than 900 second to complete

645
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,250
when egg points are randomly choose and

646
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,559
globally okay we do not pre assume the

647
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,470
location of the user but if you already

648
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,320
know this this user is for grammar in

649
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,040
China or you in a particular city then

650
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,049
you can narrow down this searching time

651
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,460
and we found that most of the time you

652
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,280
spend on waiting for the network

653
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,799
responses because when you refresh your

654
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,389
location right basically you want to get

655
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,400
the service provider know that the

656
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,620
location is changing so there's a

657
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,640
waiting time and that because we do a

658
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:22,209
lot of one right so that caused a lot of

659
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,580
costs innovating portion of the time and

660
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:29,120
this basically these two figures based

661
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:32,480
issues that if you can guess the victims

662
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,879
location say to a city or to a country

663
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,440
then you you can save your time by

664
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,630
avoiding random guessing as a

665
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,870
locations and here's the effectiveness

666
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:49,170
of non term tranki the idea is that we

667
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,340
know this nature paper you go to some 13

668
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:57,060
saying that if you can recover the top

669
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:01,470
four locations of a particular user then

670
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:03,629
it can be linked to your eid with a very

671
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,240
high probability but that experiment was

672
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:10,200
conducted based on the cell cell tower

673
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,139
ids right so four different said how ID

674
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:17,460
can be uniquely linked to a particular

675
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:20,759
user so so so the recovering the real

676
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,490
user ID not not just his user ID on the

677
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,310
app the real user ID is basically maps

678
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:28,469
to the problem of can you can recover

679
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:34,199
the top and locations of this particular

680
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:36,870
user so we follow the same approach so

681
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,020
obviously if the ground choose has the

682
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,359
top three locations anyway so cause if

683
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,280
you can recover to that base of day two

684
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,550
or three if we can recover all of them

685
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,230
that work great and you know case out on

686
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,770
top and location is much more vibrant

687
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:58,100
it's not a sale cell tower ID right if

688
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:04,230
this fits on Wi-Fi and then it is much

689
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:07,200
smaller area so we just do this visiting

690
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,330
our three-week experiment period right

691
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,419
and we find that the for all three apps

692
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:16,740
which you hi top one location coverage

693
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,090
and the five then this top five top

694
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:24,959
locations i'm much more fine grain and

695
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:28,410
this is basically the table that

696
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:33,720
summarizes the result and now i want you

697
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:37,350
you a attack demo so so first of all you

698
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,830
see the target is in the blue circle

699
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:44,700
which is my lab at suny buffalo and then

700
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:47,450
we first random guessing okay so we use

701
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,399
trilateration so this red thought is a

702
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:53,020
of agar point we set an arbitrary

703
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,420
location right and we set three of them

704
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,390
these pictures use the closer one and

705
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,670
the air right now issues in the in the

706
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:05,859
bottom of the window says that this is

707
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:11,680
189 8829 this is a huge error right

708
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:14,470
that's by no means and now we start from

709
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,350
the trend adoration and then we try to

710
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,149
narrow down the result at the location

711
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,910
then we use space petition to further

712
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,340
narrow down to improve our estimation

713
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:29,170
and the the pictures and the right base

714
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:31,330
issues the stuff we're running in the

715
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:36,360
virtual machine right and this on the

716
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,360
right bottom is the screen of the

717
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:49,640
so I assume this so what happened this

718
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,640
should be

719
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,910
why

720
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,480
okay so it's now actually wrongs so

721
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:27,009
whenever you see three soakers they

722
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:33,040
asked trilateration and my position my

723
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:42,599
screen and each time wish you the

724
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:45,819
clothes point you read the tree thing

725
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,839
but which app which is social networking

726
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:52,690
service you're exploiting right now for

727
00:37:48,839 --> 00:38:01,480
tradition I think I believe this one is

728
00:37:52,690 --> 00:38:03,940
a false car so when you see a single

729
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:10,410
so-called that's we use space petition

730
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,410
to further narrow down the location

731
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:31,950
yeah and eventually it stops here so the

732
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:35,700
in the end because the accuracy also

733
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,020
relies heavily on the available page

734
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,020
information because it's an indoor

735
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,150
target we don't have the GPS so the best

736
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,360
possible location remains through Wi-Fi

737
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,240
so this is justin from the next building

738
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:55,440
so the area is now choose a little bit

739
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:57,779
less than 40 meters okay so um so in the

740
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,340
interest of time I was keep the defense

741
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,320
mechanism because there are so many

742
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,840
different defense mechanism try to

743
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,270
obfuscate the location and we did this

744
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,850
only because when this paper was first

745
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,740
submitted to ccs they said that we do

746
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:14,130
not accept pure tagged paper you have to

747
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,470
propose some defense mechanisms so then

748
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:27,510
we have to add something so basically

749
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:29,310
i'll skip this so the concluding remarks

750
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,410
so we have developed an automated

751
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,210
attacks for the first time against the

752
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,490
popular lbs ends with hundreds of

753
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,800
millions of users proximity-based friend

754
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:41,939
discovery pose serious threats to the

755
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,560
user's location privacy so I automatic

756
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,080
the user tracking attacks without

757
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,850
hacking into a BS and service can be

758
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,400
carried out without much technical

759
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,470
difficulty or resources and it can be

760
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,340
scared and where they know some of the

761
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,899
groups they try to deploy it a lot of

762
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:01,900
virtual machine instances and try to

763
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,420
localize user so

764
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,970
so and it is very important to protect

765
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,100
the user's location provides as

766
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,419
everybody agrees so we believe that

767
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,460
people should be able to take the

768
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,550
control of their own personal location

769
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,410
data and maybe an open source personal

770
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,950
location of a skater and controlled only

771
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:26,560
by the user hymns of a self its design

772
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:29,379
ok so the paper appears at sm 0 behalf

773
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,120
2040 and join the work between soon

774
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:46,000
Buffalo and Shanghai junkman University

775
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:50,020
and thank you questions yes sorry if you

776
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,770
only authorized a disservice to some

777
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:57,340
friends so with that of eliminate tax

778
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:59,830
enero so in the authorised scenario yeah

779
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:06,070
Assam and so we shoot in the previous

780
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:12,549
away um I think like Google+ and

781
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:16,090
Facebook so the depend on different apps

782
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:18,760
right and I talked with conscious

783
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:22,600
student last year CCS they get the

784
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,570
attack on the facebook so deficiency you

785
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:29,319
don't need to be friend I don't know the

786
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:31,870
details about the facebook so he said

787
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,270
that Nathan he found that the facebook

788
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:37,150
has a new of your feature they can do

789
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,950
but the young kids in some cases you

790
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:44,230
don't have to be the friend as i said in

791
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:47,080
d here for example in the beach head

792
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:50,200
right you just choose the people nearby

793
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,620
I don't have to be the friend and in the

794
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:56,140
most K so you just such you know the

795
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,210
users ID you sometimes you need to know

796
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,810
the users ID right if we want to select

797
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:05,170
a target to check right oh if we pick up

798
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:07,570
random use ID and it may not be as

799
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,590
meaningful when you check a random

800
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:17,740
person I

801
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:19,930
of them to your study on average how

802
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,379
many in tracing you did for each

803
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:26,319
participant how many times how many

804
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:29,530
times but we will perform those three

805
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,860
weeks all right but experiment you sort

806
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,650
of you it's time you started tracing

807
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,450
right and then and then finish it so

808
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,730
you're not you're not treating it like

809
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,980
every second or something right so we

810
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,070
recalled all the information and Rhonda

811
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:53,290
don't run that hand so for the earth

812
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:55,240
synchronous attack is said we well kill

813
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,670
means i have to say during the sweet

814
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,529
weeks of explain sometimes the server

815
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:05,050
crashed now you because I noticed you

816
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,480
you find out all the the top one address

817
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,570
in all in our application which i

818
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,270
believe is probably their home address

819
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:16,180
let my guess so but for top of the

820
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,430
second address didn't find out very many

821
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,500
I wonder this maybe it depends on how

822
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:25,379
many points you have sampled right I

823
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,380
thought I can't remember exactly dear

824
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:32,799
yes so you said like if the points are

825
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:35,410
chosen globally you are able to localize

826
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,320
the I you are able to find the location

827
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,549
in nine hundred seconds right in eighty

828
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,720
percent of the cases you are able to

829
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,600
find the location in nine hundred

830
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,109
seconds right so like on an average if

831
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,990
you know the city how much time would we

832
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:52,440
will know the city okay so an average

833
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,439
sized city

834
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:12,470
so you see in this are in this size what

835
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,810
the left picture is that you random

836
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:22,220
guess the right picture is that you know

837
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:24,759
the city so you can see the arm this the

838
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,709
cdf of the checking efficiency you can

839
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,780
greatly improve but the exact numbers

840
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,780
you can find it in the paper
