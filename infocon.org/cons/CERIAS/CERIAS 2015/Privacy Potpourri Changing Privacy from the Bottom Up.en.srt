00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,420
business that are oriented toward

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,480
software as a service and privacy

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,300
consulting she also heads a couple of

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,620

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,110
join me in welcoming professor Harold to

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,539
Purdue thank you thank you very much i'm

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,269
very happy to be here today and talk

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,820
with you about like it says a potpourri

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,699
of things i tried to think about what

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,260
would be best to cover but there's so

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,870
many things going on right now with

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,140
regard to privacy and to new

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,110
technologies and i've been involved with

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,790
a lot of Internet of Things issues in

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,150
the healthcare space with medical

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,830
devices in the energy space with smart

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,890
meters also with location-based types of

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,689
issues so as I go along today please

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,820
just let me know if there's something

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,110
that you have a question about or if

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,020
there's something that you want more

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,340
information on because I didn't create

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,679
this session to be you know strictly

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,689
following my slides to have so if you

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,200
want to go over something else please

35
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,600
feel free to ask and then at the end i

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,360
have my latest book I've also written

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,780
this is my 16th book and it's on smart

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,880
grid privacy so I'll ask you a question

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,509
I used to teach 7th through 12th grade

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,030
math and computers too so I like to give

41
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,799
quizzes but this one will just be if you

42
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,619
answer right the person that answers

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,060
they can have my my latest book there so

44
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,050
I'm happy to be talking with you today

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,200
about many different issues now of

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,450
course you you know

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,670
since well first of all how many of you

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:22,349
are actually researching privacy issues

49
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,170
okay so is this something that might be

50
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,690
a possibility for some of you great well

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,780
maybe I can inspire you to to look into

52
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,849
some of these specific fields because we

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,000
need to have more people looking at some

54
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,670
of these issues that are troublesome and

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,160
where people are not doing anything to

56
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,730
actually solve the problems that are out

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,220
there so of course we have a lot of

58
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,679
privacy problems that are going on the

59
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,739
health wearables this is an issue it's

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,959
just crazy to me that we have so many

61
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,360
different devices that people are buying

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,760
and putting on their arms and following

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,769
them around and and collecting so much

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,349
data and I'll give you some examples of

65
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,450
what I found through questioning a very

66
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,959
popular one here in a few slides but

67
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,450
they're doing all this without even

68
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,880
realizing how all that data is being

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,630
collected who it's being shared with and

70
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,329
what it's being used for and those

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,590
devices are not that secure and I don't

72
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,359
know if any of you have done any

73
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,760
research into the security of those

74
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,810
devices or the apps that communicate

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,030
with them but they were created

76
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,910
generally very quickly and also with the

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,799
idea that let's get this to market we

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,930
can make a bundle of money on this so

79
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,420
let's get it out there and what's what

80
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,639
sacrifice when people get out there the

81
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,160
security and then also of course privacy

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,430
is overlooked so we have a lot of

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,420
privacy incidents they're increasing

84
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,760
we're getting so many different breaches

85
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,298
there was a stat that I read just a

86
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,849
couple of months ago and basically

87
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:06,900
there's been more people two and a half

88
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:10,130
times the population of the US has been

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,769
breached over the last two years meaning

90
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,019
multiple people have had more than one

91
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,399
breach that they've had to deal with how

92
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,500
many of you have had your data breached

93
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,989
so at least a third it looks like and

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,990
then I bet those of you that didn't

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,150
raise your hand

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,940
you might have had your data breach you

97
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,508
don't even know about it so it's kind of

98
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,690
the reality right now is instead of

99
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:39,490
thinking what do i do if i get breach

100
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,069
you need to think about what do i do

101
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,110
when i get breached and what kind of

102
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:45,550
data is it that they're going to call me

103
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,870
about if it's your health data that's

104
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,630
going to be a lot different type of

105
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,759
thing then if it's your financial data

106
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,990
or if it's some other type of data that

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,960
might impact reputation higher ability

108
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,960
in the future and so on so the privacy

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,810
incidents are increasing and also the

110
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,568
privacy attitudes and actions that we

111
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,630
have out there really threaten prior to

112
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,669
see a lot I mean it was mentioned

113
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,580
earlier that I've been leading one of

114
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,370
the NIST groups since june 2009 I've

115
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,659
been leading the NIST smart grid privacy

116
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:25,300
subgroup and we started out as a group

117
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,400
of primarily information security folks

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,979
and I was the privacy person in there

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,400
well recruited some of the utilities and

120
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,490
we recruited some of the lobbying groups

121
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,799
that work for the utilities and their

122
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,020
representatives came in they were the

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,310
lawyers of course which is fine i have a

124
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,159
lot of really good friends who are

125
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,719
lawyers but three different lawyers who

126
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,400
came from the lobbying groups when they

127
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:51,130
first started the first thing they said

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,049
was there's no law against using this

129
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,330
data that's coming from the smart meters

130
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,090
or anywhere else so that means there's

131
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,948
no privacy issues and I think that's

132
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,650
something that you need to think about

133
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:06,069
the fact that in a lot of organizations

134
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,330
out there there's the opinion that if

135
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:12,729
there's not a law against using data

136
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,250
then there's no problems with using the

137
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,440
data and of course that can can't be

138
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,469
further from the truth because think

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,500
about it when our laws created almost

140
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:27,340
all eyes are created as a reactionary

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,840
type of event after many bad things have

142
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,580
happened and so we want to make sure

143
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,289
that we identify risk as we're evolving

144
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,409
technologies and then identify what we

145
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,099
can do to prevent the bad things from

146
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,560
happening

147
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,890
well it's not personal information

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,130
that's another thing that came up a lot

149
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:51,219
in the smart grid groups over the years

150
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,170
as I've been having discussions one of

151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,350
the things we identified that could be a

152
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,210
privacy issue is of course depending

153
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,110
upon what kind of smart meter you have

154
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,479
and how often you get meter reads you

155
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,490
could get if you are doing constant

156
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,280
meter reads and right now in the u.s.

157
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,950
there's none no utilities that are but

158
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,320
if you use being constant meter reads

159
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:18,310
you could basically tell everything that

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,240
a person was doing in a home based upon

161
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,030
that energy usage and it was figured out

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,930
even back with the dumb wheel going

163
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,570
around to measure your energy there was

164
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,260
research done back in the 1980s using

165
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,909
that to show how you could determine

166
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,570
exactly when someone was boiling a pot

167
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,970
of water on the stove or they were

168
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,940
cycled in on their refrigerator well now

169
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,210
it's even something more critical is

170
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,770
that fingerprint if you will that can be

171
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:56,109
attributed to a specific location so

172
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:59,020
when we were talking about the risk what

173
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,830
if insurance companies got these energy

174
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,380
fingerprints that could have perhaps a

175
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,479
difference on what your premium was if

176
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,060
they saw that you were using a lot more

177
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,780
energy or they could identify that you

178
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,130
had a really old refrigerator that was

179
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,729
constantly going and it was a fire

180
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,260
hazard and so on so these are the types

181
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,260
of things you need to think about not

182
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:27,250
only that but we have all of this

183
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,289
scrutiny of the energy industry and what

184
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,930
they're doing with smart meters and yet

185
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,539
people are buying smart appliances like

186
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,880
crazy I mean their sale this is cool I

187
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,120
don't know if you saw it was in the last

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,000
week there was on ABC News they did a

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,180
little experiment and they showed how

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,990
easy it was for this one house that a

191
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,719
woman had everything smart in that at

192
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,079
home she had what is that amazon

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,800
on a tower that you can talk to now it

194
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:01,839
the what echo yeah she had one of those

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,479
so she was talking to it all the time

196
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,110
she had all of her locks on the house

197
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,779
all connected she had everything in that

198
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,670
house the blender the the washing

199
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,800
machine the dryer everything was there

200
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,170
and they showed how people could hack in

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,810
and then just start turning on things so

202
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,209
what's been very interesting to me to

203
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,209
notice over the years is we have these

204
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:27,758
groups that are just adamant about how

205
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:30,878
smart meters are horrible and they're

206
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,920
invasive on privacy and all this but yet

207
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,129
if you look at those same group members

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,469
they're buying this these appliances and

209
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,600
they have no idea where all this data is

210
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,810
going to so that's something else that

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,939
you know these attitudes about privacy

212
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,699
and how to address it are really

213
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:51,939
lopsided they're focusing on one thing

214
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:54,310
and completely ignoring another and why

215
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:56,139
is that well in my theory and what I've

216
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:00,638
seen over the years is the fact that

217
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:03,459
when people have perceived control over

218
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,410
these devices they bought them they put

219
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:07,089
them in their home they're using them on

220
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,089
their tablets you know controlling them

221
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,829
they perceive that they have control

222
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,430
over them so they don't view them as

223
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,829
being something that's privacy invasive

224
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,680
especially if they have perceived value

225
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,930
from them as well well I I can get to

226
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,809
work and notice that if my garage door

227
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,149
was open so I can use this controller to

228
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,399
shut it that's really cool yeah it is

229
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,829
cool but at the same time they look at

230
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,949
what someone who they have no control

231
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:39,370
over the utilities or the government is

232
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:41,349
doing and that raises the red flag a lot

233
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,089
higher so this perceived control is

234
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,930
another thing to consider when you're

235
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:51,040
looking at privacy issues that that

236
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:53,378
impacts actions that people take posting

237
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,649
about some someone else and this is

238
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:59,019
something that happens all the time I'm

239
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,559
assuming most of you are on Facebook or

240
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,590
Instagram or Twitter or all of them and

241
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,069
even more

242
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:09,770
a few years ago why I'm from Des Moines

243
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,140
Iowa and we have a great Iowa State Fair

244
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,319
we have great entertainment that comes

245
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,720
so I some of my friends to the train and

246
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,030
maroon five concert and one of my

247
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,640
friends was kind of nervous about going

248
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,579
because her husband and her two sons had

249
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,130
gone that weekend on a camping trip and

250
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,530
she was in a neighborhood that had

251
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,500
recently had some break-ins so she was

252
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,720
concerned about leaving her house there

253
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,000
without anyone in it so she turned on

254
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,730
the TV and she turned on lights and she

255
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,060
had a radio going she said that should

256
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,960
be okay well about 20 minutes into the

257
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,469
concert somebody posted two to Facebook

258
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,260
hey Wendy I see you you're seven rows

259
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,450
below me at the the Train maroon five

260
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,850
concert how do you like it how do you

261
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,450
like being alone without all the guys at

262
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,390
the house that just ruined her night I

263
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,880
mean she got so nervous after that that

264
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,250
it really she had a hard time

265
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,460
concentrating and she actually went up

266
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,220
and asked the person to remove what was

267
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,580
a public post to Facebook it wasn't even

268
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,250
one that was restricted for viewing so

269
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,880
she could think about you know having

270
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,130
fun but other people post other images

271
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,410
and other files about other people all

272
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,320
the time we have frictionless sharing

273
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,990
meaning when you go online and you're

274
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,750
maybe you're going to a site you're

275
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,120
looking for some shoes some clothes who

276
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,910
knows what there's all sorts of data

277
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,500
automatically being collected while

278
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,600
you're on those sites well guess what

279
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,760
when you go to other sites then all of

280
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,210
that data that's been collected through

281
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,680
your browser's through other types of

282
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,870
metadata that's being shared in the

283
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,329
background that's being sent to

284
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,770
marketers and lo and behold when you go

285
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,600
to another side all of a sudden

286
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,300
something pops up that you were looking

287
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,920
at an hour or two previously in air like

288
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,319
you look well that's frictionless

289
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,449
sharing you didn't ask them to give you

290
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,580
this information but they were following

291
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,650
you around digitally so they know that

292
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,310
it's there and and they're going to

293
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,130
gather more data about

294
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,310
as you go nobody cares about privacy

295
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,560
that's another thing here and a similar

296
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,779
one is well if you're not doing anything

297
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,569
bad then you don't need to worry about

298
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,520
it right all people who say that I think

299
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,790
they're they haven't thought it through

300
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,569
because really can you imagine if you

301
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:42,150
were completely open and actually did do

302
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,330
everything under the scrutiny of a

303
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,329
camera and audio I think you wouldn't

304
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,490
want somebody in the shower with you or

305
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,250
when you're doing other things maybe

306
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,150
that is private and plus it's it's not a

307
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,560
matter of doing something bad anyway

308
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,060
privacy at its core is about giving

309
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,510
people control over their own

310
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,640
information and letting them have the

311
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,670
opportunity to make decisions about how

312
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,589
it's used to its shared with how it's

313
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,110
used for making decisions that impact

314
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:16,290
ultimately their lives their livelihood

315
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:19,339
and so on and then also online data is

316
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,829
fair game I hear this a lot one of my

317
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,720
businesses that I have which is the

318
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,480
software as a service is for health care

319
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,520
covered entities and business associates

320
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,190
and I I saw there was a huge need

321
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,410
because there's so many small and medium

322
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,330
sized covered entities and business

323
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,730
associates especially in health care who

324
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,000
really know nothing about securing

325
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,150
information or how to address privacy so

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,890
i created this tool to help them and so

327
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,829
they come to me with questions and

328
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,600
almost every week I get a question from

329
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,580
one of my business associate clients

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,870
saying well protected health information

331
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,940
under HIPAA and it's 18 items plus one

332
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,250
that's a catch-all that says anything

333
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,530
that can be tied to an individual but

334
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,660
anyway the VA's come to me and say well

335
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,150
you know we don't have to protect name

336
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,300
or address right because name and

337
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,010
address can be found in a phone book and

338
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,560
since it's out there for everybody to

339
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,450
see anyway it doesn't matter well it

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,900
does matter because you have to consider

341
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,070
context and context is so important and

342
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm going to go through a few slides

343
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,350
here in a little bit so you can see why

344
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,150
you have to consider context and that's

345
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,640
something so new for most people

346
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,880
specially if you've been just dealing

347
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,800
with information security and following

348
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,230
all of the good types of frameworks for

349
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
risk assessments and so on context is

350
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,660
something that hasn't really been

351
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,000
drilled into the methodologies that are

352
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,089
being used with privacy you have to

353
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,190
consider that there's also many more if

354
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,440
there's no personal information involved

355
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,330
there's no privacy impacts boy where

356
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,820
have you heard this before with metadata

357
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:05,200
right well metadata is not personal data

358
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:07,840
well there's been all sorts of proof

359
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,570
that you can take metadata and reveal

360
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,940
basically the details of a person's

361
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,890
lives just by looking at the metadata

362
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,470
thats related to their phone calls or

363
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,439
emails or online activity the

364
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,390
surveillance that happens to be at

365
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,370
stoplights and on the sides of buildings

366
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,520
and so on and all of that's being

367
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,010
collected in fact this is an aside at

368
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,290
anyone see there was a headline this

369
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,470
morning that now they're saying that the

370
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,770
bulk collection of phone records wasn't

371
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:42,370
started on sep tember 11 it was actually

372
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,079
started in 1992 under Bush Senior so I

373
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,220
thought well I haven't had a chance to

374
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
read through that but that'll be

375
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,930
interesting reading if you guys want to

376
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,230
look at that later encrypt it and you

377
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:56,530
don't have to worry I hear this a lot to

378
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:59,440
encryption alone is a great tool it

379
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,170
protects confidentiality right it keeps

380
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,910
people from seeing the data getting to

381
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,040
the data but that is not the same as

382
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,560
privacy so you're going to find out

383
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,899
there a lot of people when they say

384
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,669
you're protecting privacy you know are

385
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,530
you protecting privacy or how are you

386
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,770
addressing it they'll say we encrypt the

387
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,230
data period that's not enough to address

388
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,750
privacy you have to go so much more than

389
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,760
that if people put the personal

390
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,089
information online and they want you to

391
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,950
have it I hear that a lot too in fact

392
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,320
there's a lot of businesses out there

393
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,600
and I've talked with some of them and

394
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,429
given classes to some of them who

395
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,500
actually have tools that go out and

396
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,770
scrape all of the data that they can

397
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,780
find publicly available on websites

398
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,830
certainly on social media sites but they

399
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,320
go beyond that

400
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,629
to other sites as well put that into

401
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,700
databases and they resell it oftentimes

402
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:56,140
as marketing databases to big companies

403
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,179
right there you have a problem if you're

404
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,909
a big company and you didn't look at the

405
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,940
ethics with which that database was

406
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:06,279
created because if people didn't give

407
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,940
their consent to have their information

408
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:13,330
used for marketing that's context of use

409
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,720
right there then basically they could be

410
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:19,149
violating a number of not only privacy

411
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,399
principles but basically depending upon

412
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,018
the industry they're in or the location

413
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,340
there and they could even be violating

414
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:29,409
federal rules or state rules as well

415
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,840
also this is another one I hear it just

416
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:35,909
drives me crazy too many privacy

417
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,610
protections inhibit innovation and in

418
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:43,110
inhibit positive advances i hear that i

419
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:46,840
think are you serious because really if

420
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,199
you want innovation create a tool that's

421
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,299
not only going to do cool things but

422
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,889
it's going to be even more innovative if

423
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:57,460
you create it in a way that it actually

424
00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:00,010
protects privacy so it doesn't it

425
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:03,250
doesn't inhibit innovation it should

426
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,929
inspire better innovation so that you

427
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,059
have a tool that's not going to

428
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,039
ultimately result in bad things

429
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,320
happening to the people using them and

430
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,590
then a couple of years ago of course

431
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,019
after the NSA revelations why they say

432
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,539
why should we even use encryption if NSA

433
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,880
can break it all well of course you know

434
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:24,190
that it's not that NSA can break it all

435
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,919
and also it's not just about keeping the

436
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,330
government out of files right there's a

437
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,070
lot of other people you want to keep out

438
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,720
of those files that you encrypt too I

439
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,570
mean there's a lot of crooks that would

440
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,130
love to get to data that's encrypted and

441
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,740
if you have it strongly encrypted they

442
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:42,669
aren't going to get to it so context

443
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,850
must be considered and I this is a

444
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,159
pointer to blog post in fact if anybody

445
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,080
wants a copy of my slides after I've

446
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,529
gone through this just send me an email

447
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,730
and i'll send you a copy of it but I

448
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,799
write a lot of blogs I have been since

449
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,590
2005

450
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,408
five or six but it's so important you

451
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,379
have to think about not just the data

452
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,749
items and I know from back when I was

453
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:11,418
creating systems and software often

454
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:14,029
times in the specs that's all you would

455
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:16,419
see well this specific type of data has

456
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,429
to have this specific type of control

457
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:21,580
nothing was even mentioned about the

458
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:24,289
context within which it was being used

459
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,119
well now as you go forward you're going

460
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:29,029
to have to if you're going to go into

461
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,189
engineering systems or software or

462
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:33,559
whatever you have to consider the

463
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,259
context and often times if you get a job

464
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,450
with a large organization they might not

465
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:40,730
realize this they might just say create

466
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,470
the system that's when it's going to be

467
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,470
important for you to come back and say

468
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,999
well tell me more about the context

469
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,009
within which the state is going to be

470
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:53,299
used so I know what other types of

471
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:57,080
controls or permissions that we need to

472
00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:00,649
use for it so here let's let's take a

473
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,220
very simple type of personal information

474
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:06,529
item your full name okay so when you

475
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,879
have a full name and you have and they

476
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,529
still deliver them I don't know if you

477
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:13,399
all still get them here but you get the

478
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:15,710
big old white pages yellow pages has

479
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:18,408
everybody's name and phone number and an

480
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,679
address in there well if you look at

481
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,119
somebody's name within that phone book

482
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,549
it's just a name with a lot of other

483
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,488
names and the context for the use of

484
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,499
that is to be able to find people's

485
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:33,470
phone numbers right so you can call them

486
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:36,559
that's the context within which those

487
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:40,039
names are found well now what if

488
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,850
somebody had a data file from a mental

489
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,429
health facility that had a list of

490
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,289
peoples and names now all of a sudden

491
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,210
that context is different right you

492
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,789
might have a lot of names and it might

493
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,580
be the exact same names that exist in

494
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:58,309
the phone book but now the context is

495
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,249
that they are associated with a mental

496
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:04,190
health facility so now you know

497
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:08,090
something more about them than you knew

498
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,480
in the phone book now you know that they

499
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,699
might be getting mental health treatment

500
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,679
or they might be working there they

501
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,730
might be doing something there the

502
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,830
context matters what if you found a list

503
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,740
of persons who were sexting with a

504
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,629
popular politician well that could have

505
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,210
some ramifications especially around

506
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,429
election time certainly but even if you

507
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,910
had the same names they were in the

508
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:36,000
phone book when you put it into this

509
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:39,309
context for showing activity they did

510
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,580
that creates different privacy risk and

511
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:45,760
different privacy problems as another

512
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,860
example what if you found a list of

513
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,860
names the same names that are in a phone

514
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,830
book but it was names that belong to

515
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:57,040
some sort of hate group within that

516
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:00,428
context now this is maybe a revelation

517
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,159
it might be a revelation if it's true or

518
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,440
if it's not true it could negatively

519
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,470
impact somebody's life maybe that

520
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,240
somebody has the same name as someone

521
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,160
you know with that name and now all of a

522
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,540
sudden that person is going to be

523
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,770
treated differently because it's

524
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,720
perceived that they're in a different

525
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:22,660
route or what if you found a revenge

526
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,419
poor shaming site this was just in the

527
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,720
news here in the last few days to where

528
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:31,679
this guy he's getting 18 years in prison

529
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,910
now he actually set up a site so after

530
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,890
couples broke up why one of them it was

531
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,780
right in the ninety-eight percent of

532
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,480
them were the men that we're taking

533
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,399
naked photos and videos of their

534
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,980
ex-girlfriends and putting it up on the

535
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,040
site and then this guy also had another

536
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,049
business and this other business was

537
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,820
will pay me five hundred dollars or

538
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:57,668
eight hundred dollars and I'll make sure

539
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,639
this other site gets all of those that

540
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,620
information down you watched it go out

541
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,020
there sometime and watch the testimony

542
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,299
of the victims of that and a lot of them

543
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,389
talked about the impacts the privacy

544
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,668
impacts the privacy harms that happen to

545
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,559
their lives some of them said they don't

546
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:16,590
even have their family talking to them

547
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,450
anymore some of them in lost their job

548
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,449
so those again what if you had the names

549
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,250
and and that was another thing he

550
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,700
didn't list people's names on that site

551
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:30,179
and their address context has to be

552
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,279
considered also something very important

553
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,559
with regard to privacy is that it's not

554
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,960
just about information and most

555
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,779
companies only deal with protecting a

556
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,669
privacy by protecting specific

557
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,370
information items but it goes beyond

558
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:46,470
that you also have to think about three

559
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,678
other types of privacy now one of them

560
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,019
is bodily privacy bodily privacy means

561
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,799
that you're finding out something about

562
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:59,070
a person's makeup so this could be like

563
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:04,110
DNA testing drug testing that employers

564
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,600
often make you know applicants do when

565
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,969
you go to the to the airport I mean I

566
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,269
did this this morning that's pretty

567
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,669
invasive from a bodily standpoint you

568
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:17,159
know they're getting every view possible

569
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:20,190
there so you have to think about all of

570
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,889
that data that's being collected when

571
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,419
you're doing invasive things to people

572
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:26,789
like that how are you protecting that

573
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,620
information how are you using it who are

574
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,919
you sharing it with what decisions are

575
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,418
being made that could impact their life

576
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:36,240
territorial privacy this gets into like

577
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,179
the surveillance cameras so you're

578
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,940
watching what people might be doing

579
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:43,980
maybe you're doing have cameras that are

580
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,519
out in a public place but oftentimes

581
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,950
those cameras get into private places I

582
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,840
mean Google Street View is constantly

583
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,960
dealing with the fact that they're on a

584
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,330
public road but they're taking images

585
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,010
from private property as they drive

586
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,370
along so they can load it on their site

587
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:06,240
and now there's even many different

588
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:08,939
websites that are called the funny shots

589
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,620
from google street view and so on that

590
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,620
people have put up that show people

591
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,860
who've passed out on the lawn or falling

592
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:19,610
down and so on well what Google Street

593
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,320
View did was they did create a way to

594
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,949
remove an image if you found it and

595
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,918
submitted a complaint but what's kind of

596
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,419
bad about the Hat is the fact that

597
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,419
village is out there and as you know

598
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,940
once an image is on the internet and if

599
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,250
it's a funny image or

600
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,050
to be funny by someone that image is

601
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,760
going to be copied and it's going to be

602
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,050
all over the place you'll never get it

603
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,750
off so you need to think about

604
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,800
territorial privacy and then of course

605
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,350
communications privacy so this is

606
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,620
privacy of not only your digital

607
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:55,909
communication your email VoIP that's

608
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:59,030
stored on incorporations if you're using

609
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:02,330
skype white all of that conversation is

610
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,220
being stored inaccessible and even here

611
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,740
in the classroom you know the potential

612
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,500
that somebody might have a smart phone

613
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,210
recording everything and that's you know

614
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm fine with that today but maybe

615
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,780
you're in a situation where you're in a

616
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,330
meeting and you don't want to have those

617
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,480
conversations recorded that's

618
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,129
communications privacy now there are

619
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,310
many different types of privacy

620
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,830
principles throughout the world and if

621
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,389
you've been to any of these privacy

622
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,760
classes you've probably heard of them so

623
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on

624
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,800
this I watched some of your past serious

625
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,990
videos so i know that you've got over

626
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,600
this but probably the one that people

627
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,210
point to the most are the oecd privacy

628
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,659
principles that were released in 1980

629
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:50,180
they were actually updated in 2013 and

630
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,450
they were updated to reflect the newer

631
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,430
technologies now that have to really

632
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,510
address such things as privacy breaches

633
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:00,920
and so on but just you know using these

634
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,180
and saying when you build a system

635
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,250
builder process you need to collect only

636
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,780
the data necessary for the purpose for

637
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,090
which you're collecting it that's the

638
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,300
collection limitation certainly well we

639
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,520
know a lot of we know a lot of the

640
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,560
mobile apps right now aren't doing that

641
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,190
in fact there's been several studies

642
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:25,820
that show how many other third parties

643
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,020
that the are being shared with the data

644
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,030
that's being collected through the

645
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,180
mobile apps and why did the mobile apps

646
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,460
need to get access to my email contact

647
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,680
list anyway doesn't make sense I just

648
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,810
wanted a time app on my phone I didn't

649
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,760
want to do anything about sending

650
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:43,310
messages to people when I go to

651
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,520
different time zone you know so they're

652
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,470
collecting a lot more data than isn't

653
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,660
necessary and there's another good thing

654
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,310
that you can look up and if use your

655
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,770
favorite search engine and you can see

656
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:58,030
this but i think it was down in

657
00:28:53,770 --> 00:29:00,040
Australia they did a study or not a

658
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,020
study but experiment so you know when

659
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,030
you load a nap a lot of times it'll say

660
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,330
oh we're going to collect this so we

661
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,790
need access to post messages on facebook

662
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,310
on your behalf and we want to do this

663
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,560
most people say okay sure you know

664
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,770
what's worse that can happen what they

665
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:21,129
did was they had one of their fast food

666
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:23,110
restaurants the the workers there they

667
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,570
had them whenever somebody would come up

668
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,250
and do an order they had them ask the

669
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,250
same types of questions that the mobile

670
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,700
apps use so when somebody would order

671
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,530
like a hamburger they said okay and then

672
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,040
they'd say let me see the last three

673
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:41,500
texts on your telephone and the person

674
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,090
would look at like why as they say well

675
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,890
let me just let me see them you know if

676
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,139
you want your hamburger let me see the

677
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,520
the text and if they'd say no then

678
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,170
they'd say well let me look at the

679
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,210
photos that you have on your smartphone

680
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:56,050
so they're asking the same type of

681
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:58,270
questions is what the apps were but of

682
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,370
course the people were like heck no we

683
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,480
don't want you to do that what was the

684
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,429
difference they were having

685
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,140
person-to-person interaction and they

686
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,540
were actually thinking about the fact

687
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,660
that here is a live person that could be

688
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,040
looking at this we're in actuality when

689
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,900
they're using those apps that they

690
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,629
loaded their probably sharing that with

691
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,100
you know hundreds of other third parties

692
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,370
that might have hundreds of employees

693
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,439
themselves so you need to think beyond

694
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,479
just these principles and you need to

695
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,170
think about how you're implementing them

696
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,910
now this I love infographics this is

697
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,760
when I did a couple of years ago and

698
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,560
this was when I started getting into the

699
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,570
Internet of Things and again I know it's

700
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,040
hard to see right here but if you send

701
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,919
me an email I'll be glad to send you a

702
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,510
link to it I wanted to demonstrate that

703
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,630
as you go through the course of the day

704
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:49,450
you're sharing your data in many ways

705
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,910
that you may not even realize from the

706
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,070
time you get up when your iPhone alarm

707
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:57,590
goes off and when that iphone alarm goes

708
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,418
off chances are that that app knows that

709
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:03,590
you got up at that time they sent it out

710
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:05,779
to whomever the app provider is it can

711
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,289
automatically turn on your coffee maker

712
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,120
and even warm up your shower to just the

713
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,799
right amount before you get in there so

714
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,918
you don't have to wait until it you know

715
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,080
it's not too cold you go to the hospital

716
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,299
to visit a friend or relative there's

717
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,918
all sorts of surveillance and other data

718
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,679
being collected especially through

719
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,590
medical devices so anyway this is

720
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,289
something I created to demonstrate to

721
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,350
folks that your data is being collected

722
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:36,020
when you just simply walk from one side

723
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,168
of the campus to the other even if you

724
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,679
don't have a smart device I guess here

725
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:45,919
I'll show you what I use for my not so

726
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,799
smart phone I travel with this do any of

727
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,809
you still use a flip phone and think so

728
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,270
I actually found somebody last week that

729
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,830
did but they were paranoid like me about

730
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,860
the fact that their smartphones were

731
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:01,340
collecting so much data but anyway even

732
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,100
even if I have this there's still data

733
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,590
being collected about me and what I'm

734
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,629
doing based upon everybody else around

735
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,270
me so we're all a part of the Internet

736
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,779
of Things whether or not we have a smart

737
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:17,658
gadget on our person we also have to

738
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:20,899
think about big data big data is another

739
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:23,679
area that it's just amazing have any of

740
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:27,049
you been working with big data analytics

741
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,529
okay so you know the power of how you

742
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:33,168
can take data that just five years ago

743
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:34,580
if you looked at it and analyzed it you

744
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:38,210
would not be able to get a lot of

745
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,428
meaningful results out of it but now big

746
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,880
data analytics can take anonymize

747
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:46,760
databases that are huge mix them with

748
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,450
other anonymized databases that are huge

749
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,029
and when merging them and analyzing them

750
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:56,419
they can pull out a lot of information

751
00:32:53,029 --> 00:33:00,110
about individuals and their lives from

752
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:01,820
those databases and the data is coming

753
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,399
from everywhere I mean there's so many

754
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,950
different things you need to think about

755
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,350
when you're using big data this is

756
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,169
something I tell the companies that I do

757
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,139
the work for

758
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:16,590
a lot you know how are you using your

759
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:19,350
big data results and oftentimes they say

760
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,809
well it was anonymized so we don't have

761
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,389
to worry about privacy that's why we are

762
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:26,639
using anonymized data so basically

763
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:29,689
they're using the results of big data

764
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:32,879
analytics without any consideration for

765
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:35,100
privacy after they get the anonymized

766
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:37,709
data that they're using and that's a

767
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,469
fallacy because we know that you can

768
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,929
take big data analytics and reveal

769
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,529
massive amounts of information about

770
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:49,409
people who do they disclose it to do

771
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:52,440
they have any limitations for who gets

772
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:54,989
the results well no because there's no

773
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,759
privacy issues involved so we can share

774
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:59,609
it with anyone or we can even post it

775
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,549
online another fallacy you have to think

776
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,529
about what can this be used for another

777
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:06,450
thing you know big data analytics is

778
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:10,679
really cool but is it a hundred percent

779
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:13,440
accurate it is not in fact it can reveal

780
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,559
things that are so far from the truth

781
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,869
that if you start assuming that that is

782
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,960
fact you can have big impacts on

783
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:24,089
people's lives as well when you start

784
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,799
using that data to make decisions about

785
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:28,049
individuals so you need to think about

786
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:30,389
how you're keeping that data so it's

787
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:33,899
accurate and factual how long are you

788
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:35,790
keeping data this is something that this

789
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,828
has been a problem with companies i mean

790
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,730
i've been working in this business for

791
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:42,990
25 years and i tell you every single

792
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,389
organization that i've done work for and

793
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:48,178
that I've worked for they have a problem

794
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:50,369
with never throwing anything away in

795
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,730
fact a lot of times organizations will

796
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,889
say we keep we keep data until the media

797
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,260
that it's on falls apart or we don't

798
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,819
have technology to read it anymore so

799
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,369
when you're dealing with some

800
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:04,950
potentially sensitive results from big

801
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,349
data analytics how are you going to keep

802
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:10,439
that data how long do you really need

803
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:12,599
that data you should only keep it for as

804
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,079
long as necessary for the purposes for

805
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,260
which you created it to begin with but

806
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,000
storage is cheap it's getting cheaper so

807
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,570
organizations say well you know we might

808
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,910
need that

809
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,590
in some time and this is a problem with

810
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,990
organizations it's problem with

811
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,930
government agencies as we look at the

812
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,879
billions of Records literally that have

813
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,149
been collected over the years by the

814
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,920
various just for phone records that

815
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,590
we're learning about and then

816
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,340
availability who has availability to

817
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:47,400
access that data to use it and so on and

818
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,830
there's a lot of different risk involved

819
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,210
and you know I'm not going to go through

820
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,279
all these because I want to get to some

821
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:57,420
of my case studies but this gives you a

822
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,920
good idea of a lot of the risk with big

823
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,320
data and then you have the Internet of

824
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,840
Things and don't get me wrong I mean I

825
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,620
think those gadgets are cool I think

826
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,720
they can really truly have some great

827
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:13,109
benefits I mean just think about what

828
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,529
you can do with and I work a lot in the

829
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:19,710
healthcare space they have amazing pills

830
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:23,610
now smart pills so that the patient can

831
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,040
swallow them and the actual digital

832
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:29,130
mechanism in them will eventually

833
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,470
dissolve but as it's going through their

834
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:34,050
body it's communicating with a patch on

835
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:37,049
their skin the patch on their skin since

836
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,550
the data to typically a mobile app but

837
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,000
if they're in the hospital it might be

838
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:45,150
to computer so they're doing analysis

839
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,160
with the smart pills in ways that they

840
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,050
were never able to do before and they

841
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,200
used to have to do exploratory surgery

842
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:54,960
and so on that could do a lot more harm

843
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,060
than help in many cases so there's

844
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,820
things that are really good but when you

845
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,710
don't address security and privacy a lot

846
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,260
of really bad things can happen and in

847
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,110
fact a couple of years ago the FTC

848
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,840
brought the first Internet of Things

849
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:12,390
sanction against a monitoring company

850
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,840
they sold a security monitoring device

851
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:19,049
and a baby monitoring device trendnet

852
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,690
and they even had a big ol logo right on

853
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,600
the cellular box this is safe and secure

854
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:27,180
give you peace of mind this data is

855
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,450
going to help you keep track of your

856
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,460
your home and your children and nobody

857
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,250
else can get to it well guess what

858
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,470
somebody hacked into their devices and

859
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,080
they

860
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:41,540
livestreaming the images from the rooms

861
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,000
where those devices were put on to the

862
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,970
internet too many different sites so all

863
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,880
of a sudden now people had what they

864
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,770
were doing in these rooms and the

865
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,440
conversations of their children and what

866
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:57,230
they were doing online and those were

867
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,360
being shared with others so the Internet

868
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,460
of Things is something that is not only

869
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,920
a huge concern because there's so many

870
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,900
different gadgets being created but even

871
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,550
the FTC just put out earlier this year

872
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,360
and I encourage you if you're interested

873
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:13,070
in this to read their report they put

874
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,160
out an Internet of Things report

875
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,230
recommending that organizations that are

876
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,460
creating these smart devices start

877
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:25,070
making sure that they actually build in

878
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,710
security and privacy controls to keep

879
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,450
bad things from happening and I find it

880
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:33,250
interesting that so many of these

881
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:36,200
organizations that have the very risky

882
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,330
security risky privacy risky devices

883
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,509
that they put out there they immediately

884
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:45,259
said well that TC shouldn't have done

885
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:47,990
this why did they say that because it

886
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,840
ruins innovation if they tell us that we

887
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,750
should do this and so you know there's

888
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:57,680
that that innovation argument again

889
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,330
that's not valid whatsoever and there

890
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,649
are many different location based

891
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:05,779
privacy concerns I put this here because

892
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:09,350
in February I actually went up to

893
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,260
Anchorage Alaska and they had a

894
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:14,650
surveying and mapping conference there

895
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,900
so I had a chance to give a one-day

896
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:20,180
geolocation privacy class to a bunch of

897
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:24,470
folks who are mappers and surveyors and

898
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:27,230
it was really really interesting but you

899
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:31,009
know because they were they've been out

900
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:33,050
in the the filled in the tundra for 20

901
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,350
30 years a lot of them so a lot of this

902
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:39,760
was very new but it's it's really

903
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:42,200
concerning that location-based

904
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,680
capabilities are being used not only for

905
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,980
good things but it's also being used for

906
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:53,210
much more nefarious types of activities

907
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:57,140
as GPS tracking and stalking in fact

908
00:39:53,210 --> 00:40:00,890
this is so much of a concern that there

909
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,690
was a Senate hearing about it and a lot

910
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:05,980
of people were brought in from various

911
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:09,140
groups to talk about how often these

912
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:13,369
stocking apps that use the GPS that

913
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:17,029
people had actually loaded on to their

914
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:20,240
ex spouses or ex-girlfriend boyfriends

915
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:23,750
devices without them knowing they had

916
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,220
all sorts of very concerning statistics

917
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:31,040
about that also of course a lot of

918
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,129
location data is being collected without

919
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,200
the person even knowing it car companies

920
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,570
I mean look at this year we're soon

921
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,160
going to have more cars coming out this

922
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,680
year the new models that are

923
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,319
internet-enabled right you can sit in

924
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,569
your car and be driving down the

925
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,369
interstate you can be online at the same

926
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,109
time which you know that'll be pretty

927
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:53,119
cool you can keep working if you're in

928
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:56,660
the passenger seat or if you're in a

929
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:00,020
driverless car let some computer drive

930
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,089
for you but you have to think about Lao

931
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,759
well if somebody can hack into these

932
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:07,040
cars and turn off my car step on the

933
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,160
brake or step on the accelerator and

934
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,290
this has already been done with these

935
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,839
types of cars you have to think about

936
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,910
that so their safety their security but

937
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,760
also privacy who would love to know

938
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,640
where you've been driving and when you

939
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,340
were there and where how long you were

940
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,500
there there's an unlimited number of

941
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,660
groups your employers might want to know

942
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,400
if you called in sick and they found out

943
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,200
that you were in Las Vegas driving

944
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,020
around that might cause some problems

945
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,960
you know we when you're going through a

946
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,660
divorce why the the lawyers would love

947
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,790
to see if your story corroborated with

948
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,368
what your car said you were actually

949
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:50,240
doing on a certain day so all of this

950
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:53,690
data needs to be protected and again

951
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,060
like I said earlier context what was the

952
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,740
context for which all of this data is

953
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,350
being collected through these smart cars

954
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,520
who's using it is it appropriate for

955
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,410
them to use it and then

956
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,500
the people who are using those devices

957
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:12,100
know that that data was even collected

958
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,100
or from them or being shared with others

959
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:18,440
this I talked about the NIST smart grid

960
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,130
privacy group I've been leading this is

961
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,840
from actually a table in one of our

962
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:28,000
reports and if you go out onto the NISS

963
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:33,070
site actually go out to the I think it's

964
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,930
CSRC dot-gov there's special

965
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,030
publications or SP reports and some of

966
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:42,190
you are probably familiar with SP 800

967
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:46,010
reports there's also misters or the NIST

968
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:50,030
IRS that they call them that's actually

969
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:54,290
where i put had our team create reports

970
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:57,050
for what our organization has been doing

971
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,400
over the last six years now with regard

972
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,900
to our research so if you're interested

973
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,090
in location-based risk for privacy

974
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,580
within the smart grid why you can go out

975
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:10,550
and look at some of the the NIST I ours

976
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,319
that we've been putting out there the

977
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:17,090
Opus research paper was something I

978
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:20,980
covered with the surveyors and map the

979
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:23,600
Opus research within their work so I was

980
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,370
talking with them about some of the

981
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,580
privacy issues with how they're

982
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:31,460
gathering images with drones and with

983
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,529
satellites and using them for their

984
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,600
mapping capabilities and how they make

985
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,510
them available to the public and to

986
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,770
other types of organizations now this

987
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,300
was an example i gave and this if

988
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:47,150
probably you can all remember when that

989
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,880
really horrible tornado went through

990
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:54,500
joplin missouri this was actually

991
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:58,220
through an opus system that actually had

992
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,620
an image of the path of destruction of

993
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,899
the tornadoes now I use this as an

994
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:06,380
example of something that made some

995
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,110
efforts that were good for preserving

996
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,820
privacy Canady can any of you see what

997
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,630
they did there to try to preserve

998
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,630
privacy

999
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:22,380
if you notice only the area that had the

1000
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,870
path that the tornadoes went through is

1001
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,430
actually visible from a satellite view

1002
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:30,240
what did they do with everything else

1003
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:33,330
outside of that path they removed it so

1004
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,399
that kept you from being able to drill

1005
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:38,360
down and actually see other people's

1006
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,820
property that was not part of that

1007
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:44,010
actual incident so they were limiting

1008
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,350
the collection of the data that they

1009
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,530
were presenting to only that which was

1010
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:52,350
necessary for that context that was to

1011
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:55,560
determine the damage from the tornadoes

1012
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,900
and they removed everything else in an

1013
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,450
effort to keep the privacy of those

1014
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,880
adjacent properties from being seen I

1015
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:05,609
thought that was pretty good so that's

1016
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,650
just one example of something that you

1017
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:10,590
can do to help protect privacy by

1018
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,110
removing these things nest last year

1019
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:16,110
started a privacy engineering initiative

1020
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:19,910
and I participated in the first one and

1021
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:22,560
that was out in their Gaithersburg

1022
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,569
offices and then there was another one

1023
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,670
last fall that I participated in and

1024
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,980
right now I'm doing a lot of work for

1025
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,750
them with regard to our starting the

1026
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,390
work for them with creating some

1027
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,790
worksheets to go through and create case

1028
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,069
studies and so on but they are creating

1029
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,550
at the very beginning of creating

1030
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:44,850
standards for organizations to use to

1031
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:47,970
help identify privacy risks and also

1032
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:51,270
privacy harms so from that privacy

1033
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:54,540
engineering activity then here's what

1034
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,790
they've identified as privacy risks so

1035
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,880
this is something that you look at what

1036
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,740
actions would your company take the

1037
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,670
organization that you're at to help

1038
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:08,390
eliminate or mitigate to acceptable

1039
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,290
levels these different types of risks so

1040
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,770
appropriation that means somebody else

1041
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:16,320
is using someone someone's that's not

1042
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,110
them personal information so identity

1043
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,200
theft someone's appropriated them

1044
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,790
distorting it meaning that you have

1045
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,098
information about individuals or an

1046
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:29,369
individual and it's

1047
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:31,200
incomplete or it has bad data mixed into

1048
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:34,079
it so it distorts the view of that

1049
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,598
individual and bad decisions that could

1050
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,130
be made in this disclosure what if

1051
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:43,920
you're requiring someone to provide more

1052
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,479
information than is really necessary for

1053
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,239
the purpose for which it was collected

1054
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:51,239
to begin with mobile apps do this all

1055
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,009
the time lack of security they could be

1056
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:57,450
used for surveillance that's another

1057
00:46:53,009 --> 00:47:00,450
risk an unanticipated revelation the way

1058
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,910
that target a few years ago you probably

1059
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,970
saw this in the news they were using big

1060
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:10,009
data analytics to look at the buying

1061
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:13,229
habits of their customers and they were

1062
00:47:10,009 --> 00:47:16,049
automatically sending out coupons to

1063
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:18,839
women who they determined from their big

1064
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:21,059
data analytics were pregnant and they

1065
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,670
could tell that based upon big data

1066
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:28,229
analytics and buying habits and this was

1067
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:30,749
discovered when a man got some coupons

1068
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:33,328
and he was raising a sixteen-year-old

1069
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:35,578
daughter and he found out she was

1070
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:38,660
pregnant it through targets coupons

1071
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:42,380
saying congratulations on your upcoming

1072
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:45,440
event and so you know that was a big

1073
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:49,619
problem it was an unanticipated

1074
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,729
revelation on the part of her father and

1075
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:56,430
it was done by a retail store and then

1076
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:58,288
unwarranted restriction meaning you

1077
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,149
aren't being given the access to

1078
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:02,160
information that you're asking for it I

1079
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,259
have an example of that for you coming

1080
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,589
up here we're running out of time we

1081
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:09,930
have privacy harms by my big point about

1082
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:11,578
this is the fact that today when you're

1083
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,680
been dealing with information security

1084
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:15,839
risk assessment and even privacy risk

1085
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,640
that we just talked about you're looking

1086
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,519
internally at how it impacts your

1087
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:26,339
business you're looking at how it could

1088
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:28,379
impact your business customer trust it

1089
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:32,130
could impact your business in some other

1090
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:34,200
way now you have to expand that point of

1091
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,329
view when you're thinking about privacy

1092
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,269
to think about privacy harm to those

1093
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:39,869
about whom that information applies so

1094
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:42,720
now you

1095
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,519
not only have to consider inwardly how

1096
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,249
your organization can be negatively

1097
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,288
impacted through privacy events you also

1098
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:51,299
have to look out and say how is this

1099
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:54,180
going to impact the individuals about

1100
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:57,599
whom this information applies obviously

1101
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:59,999
with the the target coupon situation

1102
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,309
they didn't think about that apparently

1103
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:04,049
or they probably wouldn't have done that

1104
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:06,990
privacy harm now has to be considered

1105
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:10,319
and you have to look outward and that is

1106
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:12,269
a big change when you're making a system

1107
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,579
when you're programming an application

1108
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:17,430
you start you need to start thinking

1109
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:20,069
about this from the very point time that

1110
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:22,740
you have an idea that you think is great

1111
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:24,390
and you want to put out there so you

1112
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:29,069
have challenges to how you're going to

1113
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,749
use the data beyond which it was

1114
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:33,450
actually meant to be personal

1115
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:36,720
information I want to get to a couple of

1116
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:40,220
these one last thing and I know I have

1117
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:44,308
one minute left here sorry about that

1118
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:47,189
the Fitbit folks I have a thing about

1119
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:49,410
the Fitbit folks there's I have a lot of

1120
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,630
people who are my friends in the privacy

1121
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,069
world a lot of privacy lawyers and

1122
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,720
they're wearing the fitbit's all over

1123
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:56,279
the place which is fine it's helping

1124
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,950
them they're saying we're losing weight

1125
00:49:56,279 --> 00:50:01,160
we're getting fit I said well how much

1126
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,419
data is it collecting on you though oh

1127
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,640
you know I'm not worried about they have

1128
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,109
a privacy policy well I went out and

1129
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,779
looked at the privacy policy and it

1130
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:13,170
didn't tell me anything really it was

1131
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:16,680
vague and so does this next one have it

1132
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:18,480
no and so i called him up well first i

1133
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,129
sent him an email and they didn't answer

1134
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,619
my email so i called him up and

1135
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:25,380
basically i said just give me some

1136
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:29,460
simple information i want to know how

1137
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,589
much quantity of data are you collecting

1138
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,289
through your fitbit's each day are you

1139
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:37,589
collecting 10k are you collecting it big

1140
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:41,220
because what does that relate to that I

1141
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:43,349
mentioned on the principles the data

1142
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,819
limitation right you're limiting you

1143
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:47,099
know are they limiting the amount of

1144
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:49,470
data they actually need if I if I knew

1145
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:52,539
that they were collecting you know a

1146
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:54,368
gigabyte a day I'd say

1147
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:57,189
I do they need all that data to tell me

1148
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:59,380
how much weight I lost anyway I asked

1149
00:50:57,189 --> 00:51:03,359
him for that I asked them for some other

1150
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,979
questions the specific data items I

1151
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,709
asked him you know just tell me are you

1152
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:11,739
getting like my location what else are

1153
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:13,629
you getting I also asked them how it was

1154
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:15,519
anonymize because they said don't worry

1155
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,369
about it it's an autumn eyes don't worry

1156
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,308
about it it's an autumn eyes well okay

1157
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:23,289
tell me how it's anonymized well I asked

1158
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:26,049
them that and then I say can I turn off

1159
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:28,359
the gps collection so I asked him all

1160
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:30,910
these questions and after I was passed

1161
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:33,819
around to about four or five different

1162
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,890
people I finally had their lawyer came

1163
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:39,729
back and said we can't tell you that

1164
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:41,890
information it's a privacy issue I said

1165
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:44,558
yeah it is a privacy issue I said it's

1166
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,819
my privacy and I have an issue with it

1167
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,799
and that's why I want to know the

1168
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:49,959
answers I said you have right on your

1169
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:52,509
privacy policy that you're transparent

1170
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:55,089
with how you're using your data so I'm

1171
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:57,640
asking you to be transparent and tell me

1172
00:51:55,089 --> 00:52:00,578
how you're using their data and so I

1173
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,529
waited a day or two and then finally got

1174
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:03,969
another answer back and they said we're

1175
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:07,509
sorry we cannot tell you that

1176
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:10,839
information its intellectual property so

1177
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:13,229
my data personal data that they're

1178
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:15,189
collecting from me now became

1179
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:17,558
intellectual property and that's an

1180
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:19,808
that's the final thing I'll leave you

1181
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:21,309
with the fact that now even with the

1182
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:25,150
Internet of Things with big data

1183
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:26,890
analytics that data even if it is all

1184
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:30,249
about an individual it's revealing

1185
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:32,589
things about their lives it's considered

1186
00:52:30,249 --> 00:52:35,169
to be intellectual property and so it's

1187
00:52:32,589 --> 00:52:39,640
not being released and that relates

1188
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:42,308
directly to this unwarranted restriction

1189
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:44,019
it's not being released because they

1190
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:46,449
view that as a competitive advantage

1191
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:49,359
against all their other competitors out

1192
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:51,279
there if that ever got out so when

1193
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,640
you're working with an organization that

1194
00:52:51,279 --> 00:52:56,289
is creating really cool devices that

1195
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,109
collects a lot of information about

1196
00:52:56,289 --> 00:53:00,699
people and they call it intellectual

1197
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,919
property well that might be true but

1198
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:04,869
what Trump's and that's my question I

1199
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:06,118
guess to leave you with what should

1200
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:09,100
trump

1201
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,600
intellectual property your privacy and I

1202
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,089
guess one more thing really quick I

1203
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:16,960
don't spend time this is the best

1204
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:20,859
interview I saw with with Edward Snowden

1205
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:24,070
truly John Oliver actually got an

1206
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:27,279
interview with him in a way that the

1207
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:29,369
general public can understand and if any

1208
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,070
of you saw that she probably saw it and

1209
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:37,450
he also got him to understand that you

1210
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:40,060
know he actually sacrificed privacy of

1211
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:42,339
many people whose information was not

1212
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,040
redacted or hidden when it was released

1213
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,810
to the public in the name of privacy so

1214
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,190
it's like maybe that could have been

1215
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,590
thought through a little bit better

1216
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:53,080
before it happened but you know he kind

1217
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:55,090
of put it on the the reporters that was

1218
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,810
their fault for releasing it like that

1219
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:02,109
but anyway we could talk about that for

1220
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:07,150
a week but I guess the main thing is

1221
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:09,640
when you're dealing with oh ok sorry I

1222
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:13,990
want to give my book away if any of you

1223
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,299
wants this book ok so in 1890 there was

1224
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:18,700
the seminal paper written for the the

1225
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:22,960
harvard law review the right to privacy

1226
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:26,649
by samuel warren Louis Brandeis what was

1227
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,530
what was it that motivated them to write

1228
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:34,960
that don't be good on it what motivated

1229
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:39,869
them to write that paper I'll give you a

1230
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:45,240
hint it was a type of technology yeah

1231
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:45,240
nope nope

1232
00:54:47,760 --> 00:55:05,079
no no think about what was being popular

1233
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:08,410
back then no the camera the brownie

1234
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:11,140
camera the brownie camera was being sold

1235
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:13,420
started being sold widely and samuel

1236
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,328
warren i think it was him it was samuel

1237
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,920
warren was at a wedding reception and

1238
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:20,760
somebody was taking pictures there and

1239
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,260
he hated the fact that he was being in

1240
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,000
photographs that other people were

1241
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:31,599
taking with all these little brownie

1242
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:36,099
cameras so here's that so any questions

1243
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,780
