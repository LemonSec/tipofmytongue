1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,588
everyone I'd like to introduce Olivia

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,350
Stella he is doing a talk called

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:10,380
airplane mode cybersecurity at 30,000

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,870
feet thank you all for joining us and

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,110
big away Olivia awesome thank you Jason

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,850
hi everyone my name is Olivia Stella I'm

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,460
going to talk to you today about cyber

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,820
security in the aviation industry and

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:29,080
like for every good presenter we always

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,880
have our infamous disclaimer wide so

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,339
just wanted to give a heads up this is a

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,100
presentation based off my experiences in

13
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:38,679
the aviation industry and other past

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,719
experiences and the engineering field so

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,359
nothing's endorsed binding my current or

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,219
past employers and I really like my jobs

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,109
though just want to be able to keep

18
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,499
doing conferences like Wild West hacking

19
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,420
fest

20
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:51,129
more importantly everything in this

21
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,120
presentation was found on the open

22
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:56,829
Internet nothing is secret or

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,800
proprietary so you can find it if you

24
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,679
want afterwards I do have my slides on

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,379
my website Olivia's telecom if you want

26
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,150
to find that and I provide a reference

27
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,729
list at the end of that slide deck that

28
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,010
cure code that you see right now is a

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,690
survey I'm always really interested in

30
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,660
what people want to know about aviation

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,610
cyber security so if there's something I

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,950
didn't cover in this topic let me know

33
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,470
if I hit all the marks awesome too

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,510
I always want to try to evolve my

35
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,980
presentation I had someone from a past

36
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,050
conference come up to me and say hey I

37
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,810
want to know more about the regulatory

38
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,370
cell side of aviation cybersecurity and

39
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,770
I actually did a new presentation for

40
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,170
that so always interested in knowing

41
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,340
what the audience wants to hear so a

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,340
little bit about me over 12 years ago I

43
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,620
started as a comp 9 major by degree but

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,020
I found out that us 100% software

45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,270
development doesn't spark joy but I love

46
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,910
interacting with people especially in

47
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,100
the engineering space so when I'm not

48
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,009
doing curling which is what I'm showing

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,300
in the picture I love doing anything I

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,550
can cyber-related

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,350
and learning more when I started in my

52
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,000
career I was really fortunate that I got

53
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,969
to work on a lot of transportation

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,499
programs right out of college so really

55
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:14,569
early I started on an air command

56
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:17,780
control program doing certification

57
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:19,970
I worked on a GPS program that was used

58
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,430
by aircraft and then I got really lucky

59
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,980
that I found my way into an in-flight

60
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,739
entertainment company doing software

61
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,840
integration and tests and my focus and

62
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,180
my team was on the flight crew terminal

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,120
that the crew uses to control the IFV

64
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,560
and its functionality and once I was

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,200
there for a couple years I got an

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,720
awesome break into product security and

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,298
that's when I had my Eureka moment in

68
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,329
that I'm loved cybersecurity I'm never

69
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,859
coming back and deviation is just like

70
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,959
this cool niche that you don't really

71
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:53,959
find anywhere and I've been geeking out

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,730
in this industry for over six years so

73
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,590
something I want to cover on where I get

74
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,238
into more the technical information is

75
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,700
the scope of this presentation I've

76
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,109
actually had people walk out after the

77
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,819
first two minutes because they thought I

78
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:07,450
was going to talk about hacking planes

79
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,760
and this is the complete opposite of

80
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,849
that concepts though it's just to give a

81
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,980
high level of aviation cyber security so

82
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,720
including some of the regulatory aspects

83
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,660
the players that are involved in the

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,090
space and the components of the aviation

85
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,310
ecosystem so if anybody works in the

86
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,099
industry some of this might be an

87
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,359
overview for you or really high-level

88
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,569
but that's the scope I'm going to cover

89
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:36,230
today cybersecurity regulation and the

90
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:38,470
aviation industry it's very similar but

91
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,388
it depends on what country you're in a

92
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,190
supplier manufacturer may have to comply

93
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,709
with several different government

94
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,410
agencies so this presentation I'm going

95
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,799
to focus on the US regulation which is

96
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,948
very similar to European regulation and

97
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,480
those associated authorities

98
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:59,150
specifically for aviation cybersecurity

99
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,730
there's three main documents and here

100
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,799
comes the mass of acronyms and numbers

101
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,349
them and talked about so I actually took

102
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,780
a bootcamp on these documents because

103
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,298
they're really really big and they're

104
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,250
perfect reading material if you want to

105
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,159
go to sleep at night you have insomnia

106
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,639
but I'm gonna go over three key

107
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:23,450
documents though the first one is do 326

108
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,490
a and it's air worthiness for security

109
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,710
process specification so what is that

110
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,750
why we knew that is when

111
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,030
safety assessments are created for

112
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,060
aircraft it was initially developed the

113
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,258
focus on failure onboard systems the key

114
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,949
word you're gonna hear me say throughout

115
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:42,099
this whole presentation is a few flight

116
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,849
everything revolves around that so the

117
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,580
specifications at the time weren't

118
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:49,610
focused on failures caused by malicious

119
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,770
intent so this document helps to fill

120
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,630
that gap by defining the security scope

121
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,330
during the certification process and

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,449
that could be for new systems or

123
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,820
modifications to existing systems so in

124
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,520
addition to the scope it also has a list

125
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,210
of requirements regarding security

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,570
assessments and effectiveness

127
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,690
requirements so for number two is the

128
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,509
nice really really thick big

129
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,680
specification this is do 356 a

130
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,990
airworthiness security methods and

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,520
considerations so what is this guy it

132
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,009
explains the type of methods that can be

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,250
used to show compliance from the

134
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,500
previous specification go3 2016 but for

135
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,509
example if you're developing a security

136
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,270
architecture and your corresponding

137
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,039
measures what are some examples if you

138
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,870
needed assurance guidance for

139
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,419
verification activities like threat

140
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,759
assessments what systems should you be

141
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,139
logging in your environment for security

142
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,509
issues so that they can be properly

143
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,259
monitored a lot of guidance is provided

144
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,909
in this document for me as someone who

145
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:53,810
works for an air operator an airline

146
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:55,060
third document do 3:55 is something that

147
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,830
we really care about

148
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,349
3:55 is information security guidance

149
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,210
for continuing air worthiness that's a

150
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:04,880
bunch of words saying that once you have

151
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,190
this beautiful shiny plane how do you

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,110
make sure that it continues to be safe

153
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,630
for flight in case you need to be air

154
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,000
worthy in regards to cybersecurity and

155
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,919
also who is responsible so this guy

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,479
highlights Incident Response and

157
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,729
management practices what are the

158
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,300
personnel roles you need to have in your

159
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,360
organization so that you can properly

160
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,669
manage this type of aircraft and the

161
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,030
development of an aircraft information

162
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,340
security program

163
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,190
but there's also additional guidance in

164
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,909
regards to who needs to follow these

165
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,410
three directive ordered documents and

166
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,660
it's aircraft with special conditions

167
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,700
and what does that mean and what causes

168
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,520
an aircraft to have a special condition

169
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,390
well all aircraft do not necessarily

170
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:56,109
have special conditions and there's a

171
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,750
great quote that I found in one of these

172
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,810
guidance documents escaping me right now

173
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,120
but specifically it's this airplane will

174
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,860
have a novel or unusual design features

175
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,900
when compared to the state of technology

176
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,490
envisioned in the air worthiness

177
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,919
standards for transport category

178
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,080
airplanes these new connectivity

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,789
capabilities may result in security

180
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,219
vulnerabilities to the aircraft's

181
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,990
critical systems for these design

182
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,450
features the applicable air worthiness

183
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,010
regulations do not contain adequate or

184
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,070
appropriate safety standards for

185
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,200
protection and security of airplane

186
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,960
systems and data networks against

187
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,729
unauthorized access and that paragraph

188
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,890
keeps going on but the gist of that

189
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,990
statement is saying back when the

190
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,370
original operational standards were

191
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,290
created for legacy or older aircraft

192
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,900
they didn't have in scope that there

193
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,650
could potentially be malicious activity

194
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,210
on newer types of systems so aircraft

195
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,510
that are tagged with special conditions

196
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,060
so for example the 787 737 max than a

197
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,159
350 they all have newer onboard

198
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,780
networking systems that these brand new

199
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,700
conditions help to cover to make sure

200
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,210
that the cybersecurity of that new

201
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,219
network and the space of the aircraft is

202
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,080
appropriately documented so special

203
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,419
condition aircraft also have to have

204
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,219
something called an aircraft Network

205
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:23,109
security plan that each airline and the

206
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,470
original equipment manufacturers or OEMs

207
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,390
have to work together to build and they

208
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,580
ensure that any system modifications are

209
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,409
update don't negatively impact the

210
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,319
continuing air worthiness due to any

211
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,479
cyber security vulnerabilities and this

212
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,390
ongoing agreement is is a living

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,760
document between the manufacturers the

214
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,250
air operators and your regulatory bodies

215
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,470
so for US carriers

216
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,330
we developed this plan with an agreement

217
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,450
with the manufacturer we send it off to

218
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,910
the FAA where they sign off on it and

219
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,460
agree that yes you have the proper scope

220
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,850
to manage the special condition aircraft

221
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,640
and when developing these a MSP or

222
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,920
aircraft network security program type

223
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,260
documents we do leverage some of the top

224
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,469
frameworks in the industry so we

225
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,080
leverage this CSF in regards to several

226
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,210
of the other ones and I'll I'll tag on

227
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,640
that a little bit later as well so the

228
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,370
main takeaway from the regulatory aspect

229
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,350
is that these documents and guidance

230
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,190
emphasize the safety of flight in

231
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,300
regards to cybersecurity by using a

232
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,460
defense-in-depth approach and we'll talk

233
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,530
about that a little bit more so who are

234
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,140
the players in the space there's a lot

235
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,300
of them and they all have equally

236
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,040
important roles and each of them need to

237
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,209
follow the regulatory aspects to a

238
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,459
certain extent that I mentioned

239
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,660
previously there are a handful a list of

240
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,460
who are the players that are involved

241
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,160
but I really like the compilation that

242
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:50,250
was referenced in the 2018 u.s. national

243
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,230
strategy for aviation security so this

244
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,020
was the US government produced document

245
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,050
and they refer to them as the six days

246
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,970
so the first one would be the aircraft

247
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,689
there are over 24,000 commercial flights

248
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,790
daily over the u.s. in traditional

249
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,380
flying capacity today might be a little

250
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,300
bit different in light of what's going

251
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,939
on in the world but this category

252
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,990
includes government and private aircraft

253
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,100
in addition to commercial for Airlines

254
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,500
what's highlighted in the airline

255
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,589
section is that there are Airlines of

256
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,480
multiple sizes covering all different

257
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,580
functional scopes and operation and

258
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,140
maintenance and they're considered

259
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,420
responsible for several different

260
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,400
enterprise networks and it spans more

261
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,349
than just the aircraft it expands

262
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,050
customer reservation systems if you

263
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,760
think about it of how you book tickets

264
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,140
through the airline and also the ground

265
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,210
systems you want to make sure that

266
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,130
sheets your bags where they're going but

267
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,620
my favorite sentence in this document

268
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,960
was referring to how an airline is

269
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,000
managed has an impact on its safety and

270
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,070
the security of the aviation ecosystem

271
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,470
that just highlights how every player

272
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,880
has an equal and important impact to

273
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,860
that ecosystem here lists were a new

274
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,480
before I joined this industry and

275
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,310
there's just the cargo version of

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Airlines and one may think that oh

277
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,020
you're just a cargo carrier you don't

278
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,820
have as many restrictions as passenger

279
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,740
carriers but it's a complete office that

280
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,320
they follow the same regulations that we

281
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,150
do and if you think about it they have a

282
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,130
greater economic impact so the

283
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,579
International Air Transport Association

284
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,860
or I oughta references that over 35% of

285
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,990
the world's trade by value about six

286
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,240
trillion dollars is being transported by

287
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,610
airlift carriers I am someone who loves

288
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,890
my Amazon Prime so that is something

289
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,690
that I do care about next our airports

290
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,330
and there's over 44,000 airports

291
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,070
globally and about 19,000 in the US and

292
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,260
when you think about airports

293
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,150
traditionally the big hubs pop into your

294
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,250
mind at first but this also includes

295
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,610
helipads package delivery hug and

296
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,380
logistical airports and if you're not

297
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,750
familiar with logistical airports they

298
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,000
are full airports often in the middle of

299
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,280
nowhere where you see scenes filled for

300
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,850
movies or where airlines store their

301
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,009
aircraft

302
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,290
in addition to the physical airports the

303
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:06,319
entities that run the airports are also

304
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,139
included in this category the fifth

305
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:11,839
category is aviation management so that

306
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,790
would be your international and national

307
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,620
regulatory bodies that manage the

308
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,410
operation and administration of your

309
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,709
ecosystem for the US that would be the

310
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,540
FAA Austin Europe and a lot of countries

311
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,500
have their own individual civil aviation

312
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,050
authorities

313
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,550
so this is where air traffic control

314
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,560
would reside out of these group of

315
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,029
players the last and final group is

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,180
categorizes actors and I sort of feel

317
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:39,850
that it's a catch-all bucket it's not my

318
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,469
favorite on how they have it defined

319
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,540
from the stand point and this is how

320
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,420
it's quoted people or entities who

321
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,120
operate maintain or utilize any aspect

322
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,639
of the aviation ecosystem I think the

323
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,529
scope is very wide and it includes

324
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,009
anybody from original equipment

325
00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:00,889
manufacturers suppliers contractors and

326
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:02,750
they even reference nefarious actors in

327
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,480
this group and I and I don't think

328
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,060
that's necessarily fair to group at all

329
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,490
I'm personally like to divvy things out

330
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,589
a little bit more to be specific but

331
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,750
they reference it from activities coming

332
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,540
from the outside it is applicable

333
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,370
insider threat could be a thing but a

334
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,949
lot of these groups work very hard to

335
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,449
secure their portion of the aviation

336
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,849
ecosystem so now we're going to dive

337
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:28,160
into the ecosystem when I first started

338
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,649
there's a lot of information so I like

339
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,660
to break it down easily and most people

340
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,910
can relate to being a passenger if

341
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,420
they've flown so I like to think of it

342
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:41,209
what happens before F during and after

343
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,180
the flight this graphic is Christie and

344
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,829
NASA and I like it because it gives

345
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,719
somewhat of an operational perspective

346
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,888
of the players who are involved but bear

347
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,589
in mind that it is a government

348
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,319
perspective but most importantly it

349
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:56,300
captures the major components starting

350
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:58,579
before the flight where you even think

351
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,079
of planning your trip or buying your

352
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,550
ticket there's a lot of activities

353
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,310
happening in the background so that you

354
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,170
can book that's why worship your cargo

355
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,149
so if we go back to the certification

356
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,519
that I talked about earlier in regards

357
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:12,199
to these regulatory guidance lovely

358
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,430
books the aircraft needs to be certified

359
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,170
safe

360
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,439
through whatever Civil Aviation

361
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,990
Authority that the aircraft resides in

362
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,090
and you also need to make sure that you

363
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,030
have staff that's approved fly that

364
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,800
aircraft as well and in the US there's

365
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,380
also exhilarate groups you need to have

366
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,599
TSA personnel that are able to support

367
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,760
the airport operations so that you can

368
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,860
get their security in the u.s. there's

369
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,110
also Customs and Border Patrol the

370
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,810
airport ground crews your airline gate

371
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,910
and flight attendants from a planning

372
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,380
and aspect what staff is needed for that

373
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,990
you want to make sure you have a proper

374
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:51,680
flight crew or a wide-body plane the

375
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,290
huge 787s are they a 380 as a post you

376
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,569
may only need a very small crew for

377
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,120
regional planes and also how many

378
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,770
flights are needed do you need to have

379
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,780
more going to your hubs what type of

380
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,740
aircraft you need to support that for

381
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,300
instance you wouldn't want to take a

382
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,010
regional jet on an international flight

383
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,380
that'd be really really uncomfortable

384
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,390
and then we jump into reservations so

385
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,689
what options are available to do

386
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,819
passengers and cargo reservations you

387
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,620
need Next Day Delivery do you have full

388
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,300
internet connectivity on your flight if

389
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,760
it is that really long international

390
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,050
flight and everybody needs power because

391
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,630
we all need to charge your phones and

392
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,370
what locations can you fly to so some of

393
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,230
those are the high levels of what

394
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,270
happens behind the scenes before your

395
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,760
flight during the flight we see a little

396
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,680
bit in regards to what happens well

397
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,300
while you're in the air but there's

398
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,219
still more going on behind the scenes

399
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,050
you have the avionics aspect of the

400
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,220
aircraft that is in constant

401
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,900
communication with ground and also

402
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,310
people on board the aircraft so the

403
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,140
pilots are talking to the flight crew

404
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,089
and then the flight crew has their own

405
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,340
cabin functionality that they're able to

406
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,050
talk to each other then there's the

407
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,000
cabin functionality itself that you want

408
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,089
to make sure is in same 'pliance

409
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,120
regulatory order you're lighting any of

410
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,030
your safety functions and your lighting

411
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,350
crew and passenger functionality you

412
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,120
want to make sure your flight our team

413
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,040
is working right you definitely don't

414
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,980
want to be on a really long flight and

415
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,420
not have anything to watch one item that

416
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,130
people don't think about is having

417
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,560
connectivity so you can get accurate

418
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,330
weather readings weather is very very

419
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,949
important regards to the safety of the

420
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,339
flight to make sure that it's the most

421
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,829
comfortable experience for the

422
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,420
passengers but also for the crew there's

423
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,729
times where the weather could be so

424
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,290
severe crew could get hurt moving up and

425
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,459
down the aisles and we definitely don't

426
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,050
want that to happen

427
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,790
during that whole process air traffic

428
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,670
management is providing additional

429
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,459
navigational information so tying it

430
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,378
back to the weather example if there

431
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,209
happens to be bad weather when they go

432
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,009
fly in a different airspace can they

433
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,619
take another path that would be better

434
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,649
for everybody on board and after the

435
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,720
flight but after you land still more

436
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,029
activity in the background your plane

437
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,639
gets checked again by a certified pilot

438
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,409
they do that visual walk-around or the

439
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,329
new pilot comes on to the flight and

440
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,679
there may or may not be maintenance even

441
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,240
though we don't like to be delayed it's

442
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,039
important that it's done in a timely

443
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,510
fashion but you want to make sure your

444
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,220
baggage gets to where it goes so if

445
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,720
that's your final destination you want

446
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,140
to make sure it doesn't get shipped to

447
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,000
another location by accident and make

448
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,230
sure that if you do have a connecting

449
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,720
flight that you're getting to your right

450
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,520
locations so we do our best to make sure

451
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,199
that your gates are relatively close to

452
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,210
each other because I don't like running

453
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,070
across the airport and your first

454
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,440
ability and then there's also constant

455
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,600
communication with ground systems so

456
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,630
sometimes the aircraft need to offload

457
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,418
data potentially do information updates

458
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,059
and that happens behind the scenes as

459
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,279
well so if we put all of that together

460
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,320
we get a really high level the

461
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,200
operational aspect of the aviation

462
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,970
ecosystem now we have to secure all of

463
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,809
this what is deviation cyber security is

464
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,860
every single system related to the

465
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:04,379
functionality components that I

466
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,779
mentioned previously I'm gonna speak to

467
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,360
what I've experienced in the industry so

468
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,490
keep in mind that is from a third-party

469
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,289
supplier perspective and an airline

470
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,510
point of view so here's another cool

471
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,490
graphic that I really like and it's

472
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,220
courtesy of the American Institute of

473
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,500
Aeronautics astronautics they had a 2013

474
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,350
white paper entitled a framework for

475
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,270
aviation cybersecurity and they

476
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,789
referenced the section where this

477
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,460
graphic is located as aviation and the

478
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,559
evolution of information and

479
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,600
communication technology and what I

480
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,700
really like is that they highlight that

481
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,050
the plane was a closed system this

482
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,560
awesome

483
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:46,350
was intended to not have the world open

484
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,540
to it and then it expanded due to the

485
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,580
demand of the outside industry and I'll

486
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,830
talk about that a little bit later but

487
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,020
if you want more of an understanding of

488
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,760
cybersecurity in aviation I highly

489
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,760
recommend reading that right white paper

490
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,890
so let's start with the aircraft itself

491
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,620
so if we think about securing all the

492
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,230
data for each parts of the system it's a

493
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,580
lot you can't do it by yourself no

494
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,070
matter how large of a company you are

495
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,610
and you're dependent on a handful of

496
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:17,820
those other players referenced in the

497
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,500
group of the 6s although you have to

498
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,570
remember that you're under the watchful

499
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,860
eye of your government jurisdiction so

500
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,679
you want to make sure that you're doing

501
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,020
everything within compliance so if you

502
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,490
think about the onboard systems of the

503
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,250
aircraft there's some that are native

504
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,440
the like the avionics and then all the

505
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,020
way up to third-party systems like your

506
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,990
passenger internet connectivity and your

507
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,760
your internet systems then how do we

508
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,680
talk to the rest of the world in regards

509
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
to those systems that's when you jump

510
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,150
into the communication aspect taking

511
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,760
those onboard avionics systems how do

512
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,150
you talk to the rest of the world so in

513
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,890
the air you have your Wi-Fi INSCOM

514
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,500
versus if you're on the ground you have

515
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,420
cellular connections ACARS is also an

516
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,060
in-flight communication aspect as well

517
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,620
on the ground you have to make sure you

518
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,899
have the appropriate infrastructure so

519
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,719
that you can adequately a transfer data

520
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,000
back and forth if needed and you have to

521
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,460
support all that infrastructure make

522
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,050
sure that it is up-to-date briefing from

523
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,940
owner abilities to the best of your

524
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,000
ability we jump to the external

525
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,940
environment from an airline perspective

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,490
there are a lot more external players

527
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,400
that are indirectly related so if you

528
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,170
think about the airport aspect you have

529
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,210
your baggage systems you want to make

530
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,640
sure that anything that's being rerouted

531
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,580
is done appropriately efficiently and

532
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,780
then that ties into ticketing if someone

533
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,570
happened to change their ticket

534
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,129
last-minute how does that affect where

535
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,840
they're bad gets sent and hopefully

536
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,550
that's done before their flight and not

537
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,439
during their flight so that it goes a

538
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,419
little bit more smoothly and then

539
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,400
there's maintenance aspects as well if

540
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,020
you need to pull the plane out you have

541
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,790
another one will hit at a nearby Shang

542
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,190
er do you have a flight crew that's

543
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,350
certified that can actually fly that one

544
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,030
as well and making sure that the

545
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,340
communication is constant within those

546
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,649
external environments is very important

547
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,800
because sometimes they may or may not be

548
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,390
owned by the airline versus the airport

549
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,909
that year you're interacting with

550
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,950
another level removed think about the

551
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,840
Internet of Things or IOT devices and

552
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,940
systems of the third party companies use

553
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,459
that provide additional services so

554
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,380
anytime that catering comes out they may

555
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,660
have a tablet saying hey this flight has

556
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,750
so many passengers they have so many

557
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,430
special needs meals needed we need twice

558
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,740
the amount of people in a cleaning crew

559
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,690
to cleaning a wide-body plane versus a

560
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,190
narrow-body plane and they're all

561
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,890
sharing that infrastructure and it may

562
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,320
be the airport's Wi-Fi it may be the

563
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,920
airline's Wi-Fi if they have that's

564
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,470
closer to where they're located so now

565
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,840
you have to secure all that data for

566
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,790
each part of that system

567
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,459
so these past few slides have been a

568
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:59,760
small peek into the world that I live in

569
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,680
right now I'm gonna talk about data just

570
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,990
a little bit more whenever I get to the

571
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,970
slide people their eyes light up because

572
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,830
I can see in the back their heads going

573
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,870
Olivia I want more information about the

574
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,970
plane tell me more about the plane

575
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,639
though so this is to feed that need

576
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,460
before I jump into more distinctive

577
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,740
aspects of aviation cybersecurity I want

578
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,710
to go into data domains and currently

579
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,050
for aircraft we have it divided into

580
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,750
three specific domains in our industry

581
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,700
right now and these domains are

582
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,890
highlighted sometimes in special

583
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,650
conditions depending on the needs of

584
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,240
that specific aircraft so this is

585
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,730
another cool graphic provided by a

586
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,680
connected aviation today and that the

587
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,140
domains are listed in order of

588
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,860
criticality to safety of flight so

589
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,780
remember

590
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,729
favorite phrase again safety of flight

591
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,770
so if when we start with our first

592
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,200
domain it's the aircraft control domain

593
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,600
and this is the most critical data

594
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,220
domain in regards to safety of flights

595
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,850
so this is where all the flight controls

596
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,100
happen the core cabin functions these if

597
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,110
you look at it from a risk perspective

598
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,990
going back to the regulatory guidance of

599
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,419
hey what are them

600
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,550
foods and considerations that you would

601
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,860
need this domain would have the highest

602
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:15,010
level so this ties back into defensive

603
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,659
death again jumping to the second

604
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,700
domains sort of the middle of the

605
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,490
sandwich it's the airline information

606
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,100
services domain also known as the EIS D

607
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,830
there's a another industry group named

608
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:30,010
ICAO they have a description that they

609
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,809
noted in 2014 saying that this domain

610
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,670
provides services and interconnectivity

611
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,040
to other domains while providing a

612
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,660
security perimeter I'm not saying it's a

613
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,460
firewall but if you want to think of it

614
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,650
as a security perimeter between

615
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,230
the next domain the passenger domain and

616
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:48,640
the aircraft control domain you can see

617
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:50,950
it as that and the ASD can be categories

618
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,870
it into two separate subdomains as well

619
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,510
so the first one is an administrative

620
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,159
sub domain which provides operational

621
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,790
and airline administrative information

622
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,320
to both the flight deck and cabin so you

623
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,178
can think of that data as potentially

624
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,520
being like weather related information

625
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:08,800
going back and forth from the air

626
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,120
traffic control tower for example like

627
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,399
if someone sends an errand a cars

628
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,409
message a house this information being

629
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,050
communicated it could be passed through

630
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,090
that domain as another safety layer the

631
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,040
second sub domain is passenger support

632
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,100
subdomain which provides information to

633
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,899
the passenger system so it's a great way

634
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,389
of thinking of it as like a fork in the

635
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:32,350
road whereas if you're you're getting

636
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,660
information from the ACD and you need to

637
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,399
pass it to the third domain which is the

638
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,160
passenger information and entertainment

639
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,860
services domain it's just another layer

640
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,590
of protection to make sure that it's

641
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:47,678
getting directed correctly and more

642
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,889
importantly data flow is restricted in

643
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,990
certain aspects so jump into the Pius T

644
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,690
which is the passenger information and

645
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,929
entertainment services domain this is

646
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,550
reference of having the most dynamic

647
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,440
functionality in order to keep up with

648
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,960
the demanding home and office markets

649
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,790
you think about it everybody's bringing

650
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,309
their own devices on the aircraft and

651
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,870
this domain needs to support that they

652
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,520
want Internet connectivity they want

653
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,668
streaming media and we have to be able

654
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,350
to support that for almost any type of

655
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,390
device with any type of configuration

656
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,610
and stuff

657
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,860
package but this domain also includes

658
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,919
other functionality and passengers so if

659
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,139
you have a business class seat and the

660
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,080
seat actuators or seat adjustments are

661
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,150
controlled via the feedback monitor or

662
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,500
you have a little side panel that says

663
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,350
hey you can press this button to make

664
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,120
the lights turn on the seat that also is

665
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,730
communicated through through that system

666
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,560
and one thing I want to emphasize is

667
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,020
that a lot of these systems have

668
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,760
segmentation within their own networks

669
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,000
so I don't want anybody to think that

670
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,160
you can pass one way and back it's very

671
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,190
very segmented like any good network

672
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,620
should be it had segmentation where it

673
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,210
makes sense and also in our industry

674
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,189
where it's a need to know for certain

675
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,560
data it's the same thing for the data

676
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:07,230
domains if someone doesn't have need to

677
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,750
need to know then they shouldn't have it

678
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,040
so a good example I like to give is some

679
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,020
of the in-flight entertainment systems

680
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,909
provide the speed that the aircraft is

681
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,770
going their altitude what's the

682
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,370
temperature outside so that information

683
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,830
is often passed through the ASD because

684
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,449
they're able to get it through some of

685
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,790
the equipment through that layer and

686
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,740
then passed down because you don't need

687
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,149
it from the aircraft control domain then

688
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,610
you shouldn't have to get it there and

689
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,460
it's all System pacific configurations

690
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:38,669
so to thinking about how to secure all

691
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,380
this data for each part of the system we

692
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:43,470
have to think about the certain level of

693
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,930
risk tolerance as well so if you think

694
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,760
about the the passenger domain there's a

695
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,770
little bit more of a risk tolerance

696
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,360
because you're letting people bring on

697
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,070
their own devices and you don't know

698
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,310
what they're going to have so we're

699
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,610
going to definitely fortify that more

700
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,020
than you think you would need to a lot

701
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,020
of people think well it's it's open

702
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,389
Wi-Fi like a Starbucks coffee shop that

703
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,490
you'd go to and connect your laptop but

704
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,130
from my past experience a lot of the

705
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,690
vendors put more security features on

706
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,550
there and then you think that they would

707
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,860
need and and that makes me feel better

708
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,110
knowing that they do care about that

709
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,570
aspect of it and then as you go further

710
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,790
on the different data domains the level

711
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,310
of security if you're dealing back in

712
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,830
the infamous layers of the onion it just

713
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,480
keeps getting more and more intense the

714
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,000
stringent so that was a lot of

715
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,300
information especially

716
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,280
this is new to you thank you so to let

717
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,129
it digest a little bit I'm going to

718
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,250
frame it in how do we think this fits in

719
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,810
our world we understand the rules now we

720
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,110
know the players in the space and the

721
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:49,879
ecosystem and the data domains but how

722
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,850
do you treat this really unique

723
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,860
environment a lot of people come from

724
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,080
traditional IT backgrounds they might

725
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,110
think it's it's an IT system if you

726
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,510
happen to be an OT person you may think

727
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,610
hey this would be definitely ot related

728
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,890
and when I think of an OT environment

729
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,800
I see electrical grids blind treatment

730
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,510
plants nuclear power plants specifically

731
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,669
facilities that if there was a failure

732
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:17,510
there's going to be a negative impact to

733
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,890
safety of human life and normally ask

734
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,470
people in the audience if they have

735
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,850
questions or if there's any ot experts

736
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,850
in the audience and then I point them

737
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,919
out because I am NOT an OTS expert go

738
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,709
find those people so if you're an OT

739
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,480
expert hit it up on discord I really

740
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,000
like to hear your your side of it as

741
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,340
well but does this mean that the

742
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,340
aircraft is industrial control system

743
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:43,310
not exactly but it's definitely not a

744
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:46,070
regular IT system as well specifically

745
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,350
due to the safety of flight aspect the

746
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,800
more environment becomes open in regards

747
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,959
to connectivity evolving technology we

748
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,820
really see these two areas we're in the

749
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,280
middle and that's the fun part of my job

750
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,010
from the avionics aspect of the aircraft

751
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,040
the components within the aircraft

752
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:06,140
control domain are really like ot SCADA

753
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,080
systems in regards to software that if

754
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,280
something were to happen you may have a

755
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,990
loss of life a risk that's the more to

756
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,930
electric grid failure or a nuclear power

757
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:21,260
plant failure when you relate it back to

758
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:24,830
the passenger devices used in in the

759
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,600
Paiste that's really your IT aspect

760
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,689
where you have the latest and greatest

761
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,250
technology going on your aircraft and

762
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,830
that software could be the most

763
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,380
vulnerable in comparison to your your ot

764
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:39,980
software so I live in the in-between

765
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,360
where IT in ot divided and I like to

766
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,070
coin it as where

767
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,199
like an integrated control system in a

768
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:47,750
commercial environment with ot like

769
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,730
regulation and IT needs from passengers

770
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,740
and the business it's clear as mud

771
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,160
sometimes but that's really what makes

772
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,900
my job very very interesting and

773
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,299
integrated control systems were new for

774
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,790
me and they were super interesting and I

775
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,230
was happy to find out that Herrmann

776
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,659
Homeland Security actually has some

777
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,420
great online trainings if you want to go

778
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,679
to that link you can check out their

779
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,150
classes but it's always the

780
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,280
give-and-take of do you want to give the

781
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,230
government more of your information to

782
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,690
sign up to take these classes so I'll

783
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,580
leave that decision up to you so this is

784
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,270
one of my favorite sections of this talk

785
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,540
that I lovingly call aviation unicorns

786
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:29,389
the unicorns are a handful of unique use

787
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,889
cases where I've experienced certain

788
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,290
items in industry that sets us apart

789
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,330
from typical ite you know tea

790
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,879
environments and I just like to give a

791
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,879
little stories on each if you think

792
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,580
about software caching and upgrades this

793
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,040
was something I dealt with often back in

794
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,320
the in-flight entertainment company so

795
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,230
for software updates if it was critical

796
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,389
we had the luxury to be flexible enough

797
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,850
that we could do same-day update

798
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:58,220
software package release completely go

799
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,290
through the QA cycle all hands on deck

800
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,820
sometimes we had the work nights or over

801
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,350
the weekend but we could get it out to

802
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,418
make sure that we met a certain security

803
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,030
need and then we would hand it over to

804
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,250
the customer and the caveat with that is

805
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,918
we may provide the software for the

806
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,260
system but the airline owns the system

807
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,090
and they own their aircraft so even

808
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,919
though we have the latest update we hand

809
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,199
it over to them we don't have control

810
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,360
over when they actually upload it to the

811
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,790
aircraft and every airline has a

812
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,860
different process so in our industry

813
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,200
what has been a great advantage is the

814
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,959
level of communication that's the pliers

815
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,630
and Airlines any customer relationship

816
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,820
is extremely high we we have to have

817
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,919
that considering how many segments of

818
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,200
the supply chain that we have from an IT

819
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,169
standpoint if you consider your iPhone

820
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,730
software upgrades get pushed and

821
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:48,650
eventually your phone functionality will

822
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,960
degrade or get locked and it will

823
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,910
automatically push the update reset your

824
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,910
phone definitely do not want that to

825
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,520
happen on

826
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:59,280
aircraft ot systems have the luxury

827
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,470
sometimes to say hey based on the

828
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,170
recommendations of the manufacturer we

829
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,110
may not push this patch now we have

830
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:09,570
enough compensating controls to mitigate

831
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,399
that level of risk based off of what

832
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,679
that vulnerability or security issue

833
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,050
might be we're going to wait until we

834
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,760
have our normal shutdown period - to

835
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,440
upgrade that part of the system but for

836
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,810
example if it's closed environment you

837
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,970
don't have internet connectivity and

838
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,010
maybe ok to wait but at least the system

839
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,970
owner has that option to make that

840
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,740
determination you don't necessarily want

841
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,930
either of those to happen on an aircraft

842
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,630
things need to be done in a timely

843
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:39,150
manner so how do we combat against this

844
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:41,310
in a unique our unique situation is that

845
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,410
once again our defense-in-depth

846
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,100
Security's though for example software

847
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,260
sign

848
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,909
we have roots of trust that exists

849
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,800
components of the aircraft our embedded

850
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:53,040
systems they are not open operating

851
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,649
systems you may see Linux systems reboot

852
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,920
on the seat back of inflator tainment

853
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:00,630
system it may look like it's red hat or

854
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,940
a different version of Linux it is still

855
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,460
pared down they rip out as much as

856
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,260
possible and use the bare minimum of

857
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,840
functionality that they need to help

858
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,240
mitigate risk that could be from just an

859
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,159
open version of that and also my

860
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,750
favorite example is especially on the

861
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,930
aircraft some of the software can only

862
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,300
be loaded via an official push there's

863
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:24,720
literally a switch you have to turn push

864
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:28,139
the software and it back and it's locked

865
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,170
so there's really a lot of different

866
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,060
security measures in place to help put

867
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:35,750
those different layers of the onion to

868
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,370
make sure that we're more robust

869
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,530
somebody asked what exactly are you

870
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,750
securing what type of information and

871
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,270
data do you handle we'll get that to the

872
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,820
end next unicorn topic is the

873
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,210
ever-expanding attack surface so thank

874
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,178
you

875
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,970
to IOT to exploding this environment

876
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,789
into every which way I never amazes me

877
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,350
when I'm checking out Twitter to see

878
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,419
what's the latest gadget that's Wi-Fi

879
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,418
enabled and I'm like you really need to

880
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:05,450
have Wi-Fi for that I recently bought a

881
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:07,700
washer and dryer and they had the Wi-Fi

882
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,550
option that was like no I'm not gonna do

883
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,949
that so we had this closed environment

884
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,139
and opening up just blew apart or

885
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,299
attacked surface so the moment we had

886
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,099
it's calm and you're gonna connectivity

887
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,919
you just see your potential

888
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:24,409
vulnerabilities expand a good example of

889
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,589
that would be a lot of the USB ports on

890
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,020
aircraft initially they were data and

891
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,720
power and they thought they might have

892
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,570
functionality that people would want to

893
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,209
plug in a USB stick and view their

894
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,830
photos on the back of the sea door or

895
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,300
listen to their music they just wanted

896
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,310
to give passengers more functionality

897
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,419
but realize that people are going to do

898
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,040
that because it's already on their phone

899
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,989
so what do they end up doing is they end

900
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,509
up turning off the data capabilities

901
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,699
they remove the software off the system

902
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,639
that would even use any of that data

903
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,919
from that port so a lot of them are

904
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,630
power only some airlines are even going

905
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,150
to the extensive they're putting epoxy

906
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,650
in them so that no one can plug anything

907
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,540
in especially if they already have a

908
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,660
regular outlet at the seat but it just

909
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,880
it goes back to risk tolerance of what

910
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,609
you're willing to do so the main point

911
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,530
is that IOT is consistently on a radar

912
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:19,880
to the extent that my team's title is

913
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,609
aviation cyber security and IOT

914
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,220
technologies so that made our scope

915
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:27,890
really big but I'm happy that

916
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:31,549
incorporates the IOT aspects of regards

917
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:35,569
to the aviation system last unicorn

918
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:38,030
story to tell you the future states when

919
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,609
you think of over-the-air updates it's

920
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:43,030
the great Segway because it's already

921
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:45,619
happening for cars right from a

922
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,839
technology standpoint why couldn't that

923
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,560
happen to aircraft and the first time I

924
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,779
gave this

925
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,610
someone stood up in the audience it was

926
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,740
like that is a horrible idea

927
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,750
and I was like yes sir but you beat me

928
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,029
to hunch because I didn't get what I was

929
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,440
gonna say yet but but the background is

930
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,440
if you think about it from a passenger

931
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,300
perspective if you need to have some

932
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,520
sort of software update right if the

933
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,930
aircraft is on the ground you want to

934
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,700
take advantage of however long you have

935
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,500
it right so if you have like a short

936
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,990
update you can push that's not going to

937
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,420
delay any ongoing flights awesome let's

938
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:20,779
go do that some updates may take hours

939
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,910
and luckily airlines are great to

940
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,260
schedule to put it in the hangar it's

941
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,960
gonna get some regular maintenance and

942
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,910
also do a software update but sometimes

943
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,860
that just doesn't happen and we really

944
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,859
don't want to inconvenience passengers

945
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,780
so car can do an over-the-air update why

946
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,190
can't the aircraft there's a lot of

947
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,040
reasons why you don't want to do that

948
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,380
initial talks are specifically if we go

949
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,290
back to the data domains that this may

950
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,000
make sense to do it in the passenger

951
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,940
information and entertainment services

952
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,580
domain right it's supposed to be the

953
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,400
least effective to least critical to

954
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:57,590
safety of flight back to the regulatory

955
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,780
standards there's a list of different

956
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,000
levels of systems and regards to their

957
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,490
safety of flight and ify systems are at

958
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,730
the bottom like you can shut them off no

959
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,330
impact the plane can still function life

960
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,110
goes on

961
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:14,690
depending on an IFV vendor or an

962
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,490
airline's risk tolerance also the

963
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,680
original equipment manufacturers are

964
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,990
involved as well because those systems

965
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,120
are being installed on the aircraft that

966
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,799
they create they all have to be an

967
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,990
agreement and talk about the risk

968
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,060
tolerance if they want to do that so you

969
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,859
definitely don't want to do any type of

970
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,950
over-the-air updates for any any

971
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:36,590
critical system even if you're IFE

972
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,600
system doesn't update properly you can

973
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,730
shut it down but you want to still have

974
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,470
a graceful failover right you want to

975
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,660
make sure the software can be backwards

976
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,939
compatible depending on the type of

977
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,740
flight you're on if you're a long-haul

978
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,780
carrier that you're doing a 14-hour

979
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,850
flight you may not want to take that

980
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,770
risk that software push you do

981
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:57,529
over-the-air caused the system to fail

982
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,509
and then you lose the ability for your

983
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,609
passengers to purchase items during the

984
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,619
flight that may be a rev

985
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,119
new generator for you or so many

986
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:07,670
passengers in business class

987
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,460
traditionally by internet you don't want

988
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:14,029
to lose that revenue as well so it just

989
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,430
depends on business model risk tolerance

990
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:18,890
which is what I would see the future for

991
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,808
this to be big important points are is

992
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,509
the system robust enough that it can be

993
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:25,039
backwards compatible what makes me happy

994
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,410
to know is that things move very slow

995
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,869
heating the aviation industry when it

996
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,190
comes to technologies like this it's not

997
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,470
going to happen overnight there's going

998
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:37,160
to be lots of discussion there's going

999
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,618
to be regulation on it and just getting

1000
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,589
those conversations going is something

1001
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:44,059
that I'm highlighting right now it's the

1002
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,849
Chain of Custody important for

1003
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,799
operational flight plans that's a good

1004
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,259
question I I don't know but let's talk

1005
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:54,288
about that at the end think we're doing

1006
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:56,509
ok on time I'm definitely almost to the

1007
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:58,220
onion so how do we deal with all of this

1008
00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:00,470
it's the reason why I love working in

1009
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,538
this industry we have constant

1010
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,999
communication with everybody involved of

1011
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,430
the ecosystem everybody is working

1012
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:09,558
towards the same common goal if if one

1013
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,169
person has a vulnerability it's going to

1014
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,700
spread to other parts of the ecosystem

1015
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:16,009
so we all have to have a proper amount

1016
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,839
of information sharing and we're very

1017
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:20,749
fortunate to have industry groups like

1018
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,640
IATA and the aviation ice pack stands

1019
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:25,368
for information sharing analysis center

1020
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,150
be facilitators of that information so

1021
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,849
on a daily basis I am communicating with

1022
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:34,279
my competitors and counterparts and

1023
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,650
industry to see how we can better share

1024
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:38,210
information and notify everybody of

1025
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,180
whatever vulnerabilities that we see

1026
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,489
also we are trying to be better to work

1027
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,430
with the research community so I have no

1028
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:48,289
problem being an advocate to say that we

1029
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,269
need to keep doing more I think it's

1030
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:52,130
gotten a little bit better in the past

1031
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,618
year or two but it's though we're near

1032
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,190
enough to where it needs to be

1033
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,470
organizations are finally getting

1034
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,599
getting the hint that this needs to be a

1035
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,399
component that they need to have in

1036
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,920
their security program we've seen a

1037
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,739
handful more bug bounty programs

1038
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,839
vulnerability disclosure programs

1039
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:11,029
American you picked off coordinated

1040
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,980
disclosure program that's in its private

1041
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:16,400
phase right now and we're hoping to have

1042
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,529
that be open towards later in the

1043
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,200
but it's a process we need to educate

1044
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:22,789
everybody involved and we continue to

1045
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,649
need everybody's patience to make sure

1046
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:27,319
that everybody gets the information that

1047
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,720
they need we we never condone doing any

1048
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:32,480
testing on aircraft but doing nothing

1049
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,519
isn't acceptable either so we need to

1050
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,890
work on solving the problem of how can

1051
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:39,499
both sides be curious while being safe

1052
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,460
that's an ongoing item that industry

1053
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:42,740
needs to work with the research

1054
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,690
community to help solve regulations

1055
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,899
state that we need to prove that systems

1056
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,420
are secure and testing is a way of

1057
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,999
validations so all parties need to need

1058
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,470
to work together and I feel like slowly

1059
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:55,939
that's starting to happen a little bit

1060
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,328
more which makes me happy

1061
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,460
another issue that I see is that we do

1062
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,430
not have enough trained cybersecurity

1063
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,420
professionals in general everybody here

1064
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,848
is that probably at every conference

1065
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,859
they go to but it's exacerbated in the

1066
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,839
aviation industry because not only do

1067
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,029
you need to understand general security

1068
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,499
concepts you need to understand

1069
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,329
everything else that I mentioned in this

1070
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:19,038
presentation there's times where I feel

1071
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:20,809
like well I need to be a pilot and I

1072
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,150
need to know airline and aircraft

1073
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:26,809
operations and maintenance while knowing

1074
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:29,569
IT and threat Intel and it's it's a

1075
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:31,900
unicorn of a person that doesn't really

1076
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:34,670
exist it sounds like the worst job ever

1077
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,309
we need to do a better job of growing

1078
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:40,009
the knowledgebase so that people can

1079
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:42,529
learn how to do this and and help the

1080
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,400
industry in the future and that's one of

1081
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:45,049
the reasons why I'm giving this

1082
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,749
presentation a lot of people feel that

1083
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:49,309
it's the security by obscurity there's

1084
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:52,399
just not a lot of information out there

1085
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:54,529
and there is information but you it's

1086
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,839
hard to know where to start so I hope

1087
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:58,220
that this presentation helps provide a

1088
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:00,288
starting point for anybody who's

1089
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,779
interested you can start by doing your

1090
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:04,730
homework with a lot of the documents

1091
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:06,200
that I reference some of them are free

1092
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,930
other ones and you do have to purchase

1093
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,058
but we can always start a conversation

1094
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,399
if you have questions on on anything in

1095
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:15,380
specific that is it for my main

1096
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,940
information these are all the reference

1097
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,589
slides that I have you want to know

1098
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,319
where to find all these documents and

1099
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:25,180
like I said all these slides are on my

1100
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,180
website olivia stella calm

1101
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,669
normally I give out this awesome sticker

1102
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,930
when I present in person so I really

1103
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,390
want to make sure you guys get stickers

1104
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:37,808
some house I'm gonna figure out if I can

1105
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:40,480
I don't know add it to swag bag or even

1106
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:42,730
or mail it out to people but if you're

1107
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,309
interested in a sticker definitely go to

1108
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,930
my survey then give me the honest truth

1109
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:49,390
and say Olivia send me a sticker and

1110
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:52,839
then I will try to make sure that

1111
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:56,049
happens but thank you so much for tuning

1112
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:58,450
in to my presentation and big huge

1113
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,790
thanks to the crew of Wild West hack and

1114
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,470
fest when I heard things were getting a

1115
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,990
little more serious in California I got

1116
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,549
worried and was really afraid that the

1117
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,828
conference was gonna get canceled and I

1118
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,349
was just so grateful that they decided

1119
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:14,140
to turn it virtual so thanks again

1120
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:15,430
really appreciate everybody's time keep

1121
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,529
the conversation going

1122
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,779
find me on my twitter handle olivia

1123
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,339
curls and we can keep talking thank you

1124
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,960
so much for being here and for giving

1125
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:25,058
your talk today awesome thank you I

1126
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,809
think I have maybe a couple minutes for

1127
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:31,690
questions so yeah let me let me scroll

1128
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:34,020
back and there is no one after you so if

1129
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,200
you do go a little long feel free oh

1130
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,390
okay

1131
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,098
so box whopper was asking are the policy

1132
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:43,058
books available in digital format or

1133
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:46,630
paper um both but the organization that

1134
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:48,220
develops all of these documents you have

1135
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,380
to have a membership to get them and

1136
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,020
they do charge so depending on who you

1137
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,089
work for you may be able to get that can

1138
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,940
you send the white paper I'm gonna guess

1139
00:43:55,089 --> 00:44:00,970
that was the US government dance on

1140
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,859
aviation cybersecurity the link is in my

1141
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,419
reference section but if you have a hard

1142
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:07,509
time finding it just reach out and I'll

1143
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,700
get it to you Steph was asking for the

1144
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:13,150
avionics aspect what are you securing

1145
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:15,098
the information data do you handle so if

1146
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,839
you think about it from like a regular I

1147
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:18,609
don't know the answers to all this I'm

1148
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:20,170
just going based off of the system that

1149
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:22,720
I worked on which was the in-flight

1150
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,339
entertainment system it has aspects of a

1151
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,828
traditional network in that you're

1152
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:29,170
communicating how is being transferred

1153
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:31,630
back and forth so for an IFV system it

1154
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,430
would be the media components what items

1155
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,900
are functional there are some

1156
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:38,598
functionality that business-class has

1157
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:41,509
maybe that economy doesn't have or

1158
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,859
I know for for some airlines like for

1159
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:44,869
shorter flights they would charge for

1160
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:46,578
certain food items or would be free in

1161
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:48,410
business class I know this isn't

1162
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,700
probably the info you're looking for you

1163
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:52,549
want more of like the stuff of the

1164
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,038
aircraft control domain but that was not

1165
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:56,509
what I was trained on another question

1166
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,549
what's being disabled when doing

1167
00:44:56,509 --> 00:45:00,769
airplane mode I'm gonna assume that's

1168
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:06,259
meant for this cellphone it's it's

1169
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:08,569
nothing batter or specific loving all of

1170
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:10,970
the questions they're like a flood step

1171
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:13,130
into these USB ports I did too luckily I

1172
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:17,149
work for the IFV company and they let me

1173
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:20,359
uh see what could happen yeah I think of

1174
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,069
it going back to software updates there

1175
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,519
may have been software configurations to

1176
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:28,640
stop data flowing but maybe he didn't

1177
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,038
get updated yet so it just depends there

1178
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,379
is no problem of reaching out to that

1179
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,200
airline and be like hey I see this and

1180
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,079
just take a screenshot if they happen to

1181
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,249
have a vulnerability disclosure program

1182
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,499
providing the most amount of information

1183
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:44,209
you can is very very helpful because

1184
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:46,009
people like me are the ones that run the

1185
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,079
issue to ground so we need to know what

1186
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:50,210
flight you're on even give what's what's

1187
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,469
deep what route and then I'm the one

1188
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,420
that goes in and tries to figure out

1189
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:57,140
what system you are actually everybody

1190
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,369
wants a sticker I think oh there's a

1191
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,788
question what kind of questions you get

1192
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:04,160
from pilots the most they are just

1193
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:07,579
generally curious about how we're

1194
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,558
advancing in cyber security so where

1195
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:10,940
we're taking better initiatives to try

1196
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,369
to communicate with them better and

1197
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,739
there's a lot more industry

1198
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:18,469
organizations that are focusing on

1199
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:21,559
cybersecurity in regards to violent

1200
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:23,150
activities so I'm excited about that how

1201
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,249
long does it take to make improvements

1202
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,160
based off of your research it depends on

1203
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:30,709
the level of severity in regards to are

1204
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,899
you making a drastic change that could

1205
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:35,869
affect the entire aircraft and the

1206
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,359
ground systems or is it something of a

1207
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:41,589
more dynamic system so for the IFV

1208
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:45,109
company they were always looking for

1209
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:46,819
newer hardware and what type of software

1210
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:48,200
you could throw on it and what type of

1211
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:50,058
functionality you could have but there

1212
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,700
were sensing capabilities where it would

1213
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:53,619
know you were there by just

1214
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,629
in front of it sometimes people are like

1215
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:57,339
why do things have old s video

1216
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,780
connectors well back in the day they

1217
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:02,680
wanted to give as many options as

1218
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,329
possible and just through course of

1219
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,359
events I mean these systems are on the

1220
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:09,130
aircraft for years and years the life of

1221
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,380
these systems could be anywhere from

1222
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:14,170
like 10 to 20 years depending on how

1223
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,520
long as in service so even though you

1224
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,500
look at it and you're like it's silly

1225
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,150
back at the time it could have been more

1226
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,880
late-breaking if it's a more dynamic

1227
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,579
system it could be in a couple years

1228
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,069
honestly like everybody else is

1229
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:30,540
experiencing it's time and resources and

1230
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:33,460
money I don't think I see any other

1231
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,470
questions so with that thanks again

1232
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,540
everybody I really appreciate it

1233
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:40,629
this has been fun I want to give a quick

1234
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:43,540
plug to a box whopper he has is on

1235
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:46,240
Aviation presentations we borrow always

1236
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,339
wanting to help get more info about our

1237
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,589
industry out there so check that out

1238
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:52,589
tomorrow and thanks everyone
