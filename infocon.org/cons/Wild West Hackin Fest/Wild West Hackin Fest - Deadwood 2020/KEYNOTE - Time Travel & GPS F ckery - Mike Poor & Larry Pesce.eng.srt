1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,470
time travel and GPS that's fun I've

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,720
already kind of announced Larry and Mike

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,400
Larry is a co-host of security weekly

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,349
since the very beginning I have way too

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,030
many pictures on my computer of Larry

6
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,839
and various states of undress wearing a

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,299
Linksys wart

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,650
everyone has their hobbies but Larry is

9
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,990
one of the most brilliant wireless

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,310
security researchers we ever seen an

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,130
instructor with Sansa stood for a long

12
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,169
time he's been a agents with in

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,939
guardians for a long time as well

14
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,320
learned a tremendous amount from Larry

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,750
over the years almost anything weird

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,670
obscure and brilliant comes through

17
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,350
Larry has everyone just kind of shared

18
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,510
stuff with Larry Larry is probably the

19
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,250
nicest person in information scary and

20
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,820

46
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,830
been maintaining a lot of contact over

47
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,199
the last month or so over this just to

48
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,720
tell a little personal story in 2003 I

49
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,880
was working for Sam's and they sent me

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,580
to teach at the Sam Stars I mean sorry

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,189
Stan's Singapore conference during the

52
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,220
SARS epidemic they had canceled the Hong

53
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,779
Kong conference that was kind of the

54
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,479
outside of mainland China epicenter of

55
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,100
the stars epidemic then in Singapore

56
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,020
they decided to go ahead with it because

57
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,059
their Ministry of Health was basically

58
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,770
saying yeah we have 54 people but

59
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,329
they're all in quarantine and we're fine

60
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,220
everything's good I faced the prospect

61
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,098
at the time my wife and I we were

62
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,080
recently expecting at the time our you

63
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:13,780
know first on max I faced this daunting

64
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,410
idea of getting flown into an epidemic

65
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,420
with

66
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,100
real knowledge at a time we didn't

67
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,679
really know anything about SARS other

68
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,500
than it was spreading and it was deadly

69
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,840
that really impacted me tremendously

70
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,270
it impacted sands and a bunch of other

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,390
training organizations in lieu of that

72
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,790
you know sands grew most of their remote

73
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,579
training capabilities from that

74
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,910
particular event when when John and I

75
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,070
started talking about this and and the

76
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,320
phis staff you know looking at this this

77
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,670
was definitely one of those I don't know

78
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,799
if it's gonna work but we probably

79
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,540
really should go virtual for this so I

80
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,610
really appreciate everybody's

81
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,440
understanding in fact you know tons of

82
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,540
people that signed up for the particular

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,340
this particular event after it went

84
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,200
virtual because all of a sudden they

85
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,150
were able to attend so thank you to

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,390
everybody all gets and these are showing

87
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,820
up pH is especially gone and Felda Jason

88
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,070

89
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,420
hog and and round of applause you know

absolutely so yeah I was having a little

94
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,680
issues those of them slides here but I

95
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,840
think we got it fixed so hey now you can

96
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,690

97
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,560

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,100
the form of consigliere actually wartime

101
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,380
consigliere meaning when the shit hits

102
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,780
the fan that's usually when I engage the

103
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,510
most but after retiring from Sam's three

104
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,190
years ago I've taken a very active role

105
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,410
in managing the day-to-day operations of

106

I drove headfirst into the wonderful

116
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,440
world of blade smithing and sword

117
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,240

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,539
crazy ideas and start to potentially

137
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,270
find ways to implement crazy ideas very

138
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:00,430
much like the subject of today's talk I

139
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,710
happen to love the Internet of Things

140
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,080
all sorts of wireless protocols

141
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,270
software-defined radio and spend a lot

142
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,789
of time both professionally and as a

143
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,008
hobby doing those types of things I'm a

144
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,590
huge Star Wars fan haven't gotten my

145
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,630
stormtrooper outfit put together yet mr.

146
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,479
Kevin Johnson but soon and I also teach

147
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,520
the San 617 or the SANS Institute that

148
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,409
is the Wi-Fi class and I'm currently

149
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,508
lead author with a good friend James Lee

150
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:27,460
David all much like Mike I also do have

151
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,039
a bunch of other hobbies as well Mike

152
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,919
has been instrumental in getting me down

153
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,560
the knife making path and has been a

154
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,810
mentor in that I'm getting there

155
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,610
it takes some time we've had carpenters

156
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,380
in our family and engineers in our

157
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,419
family so I'd also say that I'm an

158
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,370
amateur sawdust maker in fact I'd like

159
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,349
to spend a little bit of time workshop

160
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,389
every morning making some sawdust of

161
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,219
some variety and if it's not sawdust

162
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,280
it's some sort of metal dust as well

163
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:56,139
very much to the wireless portion I'm

164
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,179
also a ham radio operator and I don't

165
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,449
nearly get as much time to devote to it

166
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,719
as I would like but now figuring I was

167
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:08,139
going to have to be on video to be doing

168
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:10,780
this talk I cleaned my office and my

169
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,180
office is actually like clean and I can

170
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,580
get to my ham radio and maybe I'll

171
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,180
actually turn that on every once in a

172
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,770
while too so thanks John thanks for for

173
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,289
having us and because now I have a clean

174
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,710
office I think we're gonna have lots of

175
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,530
fun today

176
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,880
and know some of those crazy ideas get

177
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,299
to be put in place for this one Mike

178
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,240
it's time to in for us to dive in on

179
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,219
some technical type of stuff which is

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,380
maybe a little unusual for a keynote so

181
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,930
clearly

182
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,409
based on the title of our talk time

183
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,260
travel travel and GPS fuckery we're very

184
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,080
much dealing with some satellite

185
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,690
navigation type of things and we want to

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,440
give everybody a little bit of technical

187
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,540
background as to how some of these types

188
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,660
of systems work at a high level we don't

189
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,190
want to make it too super technical it's

190
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,840
a key note after all but we want to

191
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,400
illustrate this to illustrate some of

192
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,409
the problems that we found and then sort

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,659
of bring that to some of our conclusions

194
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,420
so the fundamentals for satellite

195
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,240
navigation effectively we have a bunch

196
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,330
of satellites or each of the various

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,610
disparate systems in orbit at a known

198
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,050
position that are transmitting from

199
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,960
space down to earth

200
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,000
an RF signal that has data encoded in

201
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,030
that that RF signal it includes a

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,980
pseudo-random code that we can now use

203
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,080
to identify those transmissions it

204
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,570
includes the time of transmission from

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,760
the satellite otherwise known as the t o

206
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,340
T or the time of transmission and its

207
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,409
position orbiting the Earth at the time

208
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,330
of transmission so the satellite is

209
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,980
effectively all of the satellites are

210
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,609
effectively telling us where they are

211
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,830
and what time they were at so where they

212
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,380
were at what time we receive these

213
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,510
signals at our GPS receiver whether it

214
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,570
be our phone or some custom home built

215
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:07,409
thing or our sat-nav in our car

216
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:10,650
you name it once we receive that RF

217
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,720
energy we use that pseudo-random code to

218
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,000
align the packet to begin to tell us

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,100
where the start is and then decode the

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,830
rest of the information out of it such

221
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,960
as the time of transmission from the

222
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,659
satellite which then is compared to the

223
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,359
time of arrival from four satellites

224
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,970
this gives us the ability to tell how

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,180
far the distance has traveled based on

226
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,830
the speed of light we know the effective

227
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,809
distance it's told us where we are we

228
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,430
calculate how long it took to get here

229
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,589
gives us an effective distance from

230
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,109
those satellites with four satellites we

231
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,030
can now use that to gain some insight as

232
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,550
to where we are on those planets by some

233
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,650
effective triangulation so that turns

234
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,120
into the time of flight value how long

235
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,770
it took for that signal to get from the

236
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,180
satellite to our receiver and then we

237
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,370
compare

238
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,010
those with the time of tear transmission

239
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,620
times of arrival and use those would be

240
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,370
like to tell us where we are on the

241
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,950
planet so effectively we're using math

242
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,050
and all sorts of other fun stuff so we

243
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,180
need a bunch of satellites and we need

244
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,339
some equations to be able to determine

245
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,680
distance based on the speed of light and

246
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,350
the averages and the triangulation based

247
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,510
on those different values for time of

248
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,760
transition transmission to time of

249
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,339
arrival to create time of flight so lots

250
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,339
of lots of really interesting math and

251
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,220
yep math is absolutely heart and office

252
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:34,459
products also suck for math equations so

253
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,070
lots of sort of detail here but to make

254
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:39,319
this really easy the TLDR on our

255
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,810
satellite navigation space force math

256
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,300
and magic I actually included space

257
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,459
force as a joke when I was creating

258
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,529
these slides and turns out the US based

259
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,719
GPS satellite navigation system is

260
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,000
actually now managed by the United

261
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,220
States space force so not so much of a

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,339
joke after all satellites in space

263
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,050
sending RF that we use to calculate the

264
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,850
distance from that satellite to us or

265
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,150
triangulation to be able to determine

266
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,680
our location we have multiple systems

267
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:11,660
deployed with around the planet with

268
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,819
similar math it really was only able to

269
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,290
dig up the math for GPS but they are all

270
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,760
using similar types of things with

271
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,949
triangulation they may be using

272
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,800
different types of packet formatting and

273
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,040
pseudo random types of codes but we have

274
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,370
multiple systems and in various

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,819
locations so we have GPS here in the US

276
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,290
we have Galileo in Europe and a few

277
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,900
other locations as well there's also

278
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,000
GLONASS which is Russian implementation

279
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,829
of satellite navigation which is all

280
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,209
over the planet and then there's a few

281
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:47,599
smaller systems I do or China IRNSS

282
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:50,630
specifically for India and qz SS for

283
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,610
Japan and the Asia Oceania area to be

284
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,560
able to cover Australia and New Zealand

285
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,959
as well but the point being here is that

286
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,310
all of these systems use similar types

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,649
of math to similar types of

288
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,949
functionality for various places on the

289
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:07,070
planet and have multiple features

290
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,680
there's two abilities one force of

291
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,780
billion use so unencrypted signals and

292
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,670
then the ability to encrypt packets

293
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,620
based on a set of shared keys from

294
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,189
military applications where they can do

295
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,750
finer grained keishon analysis by more

296
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,420
accurately doing time of transmission

297
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,330
and and and so forth as well all of the

298
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,420
various systems have multiple add-ons to

299
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,400
do resolution enhancements so all sorts

300
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,079
of different types of abilities for us

301
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,329
to improve these systems over the years

302
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,890
and make certain of these resolution

303
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,080
enhancements available for either

304
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,360
civilian and/or military applications

305
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,120
because we also include the concept of

306
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,460
time with satellite navigation from the

307
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,710
time of transmission and so forth it's

308
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,630
also a very effective time source for

309
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,270
time synchronization and in many cases

310
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,240
where an atomic clock isn't used is used

311
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,430
for time synchronization for various NTP

312
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,780
servers so we may be starting to allude

313
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,270
as to where we can start doing some

314
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,400
potential time travel Mike you're up

315
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,020
satellite transmissions are weak yet but

316
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,390
that's a wonderful intro to the slide

317
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,939
the deal here is that satellite power

318
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,699
generation capabilities are relatively

319
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,650
low for what they are these systems were

320
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,900
designed originally more used by the

321
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,970
military after a job NEAs

322
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,550
engineer essentially reverse engineered

323
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,710
the signal this became available

324
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,319
essentially to the you know the civilian

325
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,600
use of GPS what we have today these

326
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,910
transmissions themselves are relatively

327
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,370
weak they have to happen often so on a

328
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,170
continuous basis these satellites are

329
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,970
solar-powered granted they have a little

330
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,250
bit better access and a little less a

331
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,490
cover then we do down here for solar

332
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,550
power because of that it really dictates

333
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,650
a window of opportunity or people on the

334
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,510
ground or people in low orbit to

335
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,730
essentially transmit a stronger signal

336
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,970
the other thing to think about here is

337
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,790
that in all of that math that Larry you

338
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,030
know so eloquently describes there was

339
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,880
no authentication of that signal

340
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,829
reception on the civilian side of things

341
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,530
right so you know you fire up your phone

342
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,260
you fire up a GPS handset for example I

343
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,839
fire up the the the chartplotter on my

344
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,460
sailboat for example and it's gonna

345
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,370
start receiving the signals doing the

346
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,510
math calculating our position and

347
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,180
because of that the fact

348
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,160
it's unauthenticated it's coming from a

349
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,750
signal transmission that is relatively

350
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,510
weak and from far away

351
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,520
these can be interfered with right now I

352
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,950
want to point out over here technically

353
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,500
illegal right license transmissions

354
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,510
Vance meaning that by law which of

355
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,240
course only affects law-abiding

356
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,840
individuals but by law were not allowed

357
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,310
to manipulate or spoof or transmit on

358
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,740
these particular bans unless you have a

359
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,239
license to do so and because there's no

360
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,270
method for this mutual authentication

361
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,180
and the signals are weak and there's

362
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,130
motivation to manipulate these signals

363
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,290
you talk it into the you know in a bit

364
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,890
what ends up happening is that as long

365
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:06,410
as you can move that signal that radio

366
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,050
frequency signal to the the general

367
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,560
location of where you are it is

368
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,810
relatively trivial to start manipulating

369
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,569
the time as well as manipulating

370
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:21,319
location data based on that right now

371
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:24,410
there are some mitigation technologies

372
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,300
that do exist they're very expensive to

373
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,240
implement there they're certainly not

374
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,240
for the the casual user you know for

375
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,320
example if you had a you know

376
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,070
multi-billion dollar enterprise that

377
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,140
relied on you know GPS time signals for

378
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,930
example then it would make sense to

379
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,199
implement something you know to one

380
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,120
mitigate the problem two to try to

381
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,400
detect any manipulations that are

382
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,410
currently taking place one thing you

383
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,920
know I'd like to point out kind of as a

384
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,260
driver for for for us to start me

385
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,199
looking at this one uh there really

386
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,420
weren't any civilian and certainly no

387
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,550
open-source projects that would allow

388
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,770
you to actually detect the manipulation

389
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,959
of these GPS signals so that would that

390
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,970
was a definite good motivation the other

391
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,710
thing is that those of you that have

392
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,870
seen you know the the the wonderful

393
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,750
movie The Hunt for Red October I live

394
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,240
right next on my sailboat right next to

395
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,360
the Hood Canal which is essentially our

396
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,610
version of polyarny right so if the

397
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,260
kemper peninsula here in the northwest

398
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,300
were to secede from the United States

399
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,040
not suggesting it they would be the

400
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,510
third largest nuclear power on the

401
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,279
planet so that's where we keep our

402
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,100
boomers over here on the Pacific

403
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,779
side and so regularly when we're sailing

404
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,029
we run across

405
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,279
nuclear submarines so that are above

406
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,430
water of being escorted by Navy and

407
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,509
Coast Guard and so you know based on

408
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,229
some of the things that we'll discuss in

409
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,629
a little bit

410
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,930
I started thinking you know are they

411
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:56,029
spoofing GPS are they spoofing AIS which

412
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,189
we'll talk about as well are they in

413
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,199
addition to all of this you know and

414
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:01,399
being up here next to the straight up on

415
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,680
to Foucault which is one of the largest

416
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,720
shipping channels in the United States

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,878
the side thing to that is that the US

418
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,569
Navy out of Naval Air Station Whidbey

419
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,220
operates a large fleet of growlers that

420
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:15,889
are outfitted with electronic warfare

421
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,889
capability and they've made part of the

422
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:21,649
Olympics out here on electronic warfare

423
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,079
range so that was kind of a secondary

424
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,300
motivation for me to really want to

425
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,758
develop a system that would detect any

426
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,589
kind of manipulation of these signals

427
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,269
it's definitely been an interesting

428
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,009
project so far and I really can't wait

429
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,050
to see where it goes all right thanks

430
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,269
Mike yeah we we talked about you know

431
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,819
that potentially these these signals are

432
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,370
spoonful and and absolutely it actually

433
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:46,550
it's fairly easy for us as civilians to

434
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,220
spoof GPS with some readily available

435
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,628
commodity hardware would be hacker F and

436
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,579
some other software-defined radios and

437
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:56,360
some free open-source software with GPS

438
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:58,939
SDR sim available for free and can spoof

439
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,189
GPS over a short distance using the

440
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,599
power of the heck RF now of course we

441
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,220
could potentially make this larger with

442
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,380
some amplifiers and so forth again

443
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,149
technically illegal to do so if you're

444
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,130
doing any experimentation make sure

445
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:13,219
you're being smart about this consider

446
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,380
Faraday cages consider direct connection

447
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,720
from your devices via cable and then

448
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,520
still doing those in a Faraday cage

449
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,260
again be very careful with testing type

450
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,270
of these types of stuff now with the

451
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,270
hacker F and and some free open-source

452
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:29,809
software we can spoof both location or

453
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:32,179
time so if a civilian can do that very

454
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:35,539
inexpensively why do we trust it and

455
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:38,419
then who really cares who's gonna mess

456
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:40,820
with it I mean maybe you just want to

457
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:43,340
mess with it so that you can go get

458
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,460
Pokemon and and those types of things

459
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,659
but maybe there's some more larger

460
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,700
applications

461
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,160
or something outside of the civilian

462
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,100
market and maybe into the military

463
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,500
sector and certainly a motivation and or

464
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,959
those with significantly more funds or

465
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,070
motivation say nation-states have the

466
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,590
ability to have more advanced

467
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:08,210
capabilities and maybe highly motivated

468
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:12,620
to perform GPS puckery so what happens

469
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,330
when we start messing with GPS Mike you

470
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,070
tell me well you know and we're speaking

471
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,290
about GPS here but but what we're really

472
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,810
talking about is any one of these global

473
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:26,080
navigation satellite systems you know

474
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:27,889
have these inherent problems so you know

475
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,010
apologies for using the term

476
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,480
interchangeably yes when we first got

477
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,740
into this you know Larry and I are

478
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,980
clearly still having problems with that

479
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,920
in that us we think of GPS and GPS only

480
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,720
outside of here a lot of the experts in

481
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,240
this field always refer to this as you

482
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,610
know GNSS the things that we use to

483
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,760
trust these things huge financial

484
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:52,580
systems dock trading for example where

485
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,860
does it get its time you might ask well

486
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,899
actually from signal that's based off of

487
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,929
this many years ago I did a project

488
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,300
looking specifically at NTP and she

489
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,400
started looking at taxi systems and all

490
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,720
these other systems that use NTP to

491
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,100
synchronize their time based

492
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,920
transactions and then you start looking

493
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,770
at things like the Bureau of Prisons or

494
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,380
you start looking at large companies

495
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:18,170
that rely on navigation and tracking so

496
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,540
for example your huge logistics and

497
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,840
shipping organizations that you have

498
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,750
obviously state and military things that

499
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,790
are directly pulling stuff off of this

500
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,620
you've got you know for example we'll

501
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,200
cover some of the things going on around

502
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,479
the world in Russia and China and other

503
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,370
places and also in the United States you

504
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,080
have trucking companies that are

505
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,800
tracking their truck drivers in their

506
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,780
trucks across country with with GPS for

507
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,139
example many other organizations and

508
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,540
uses for using GPS other than just

509
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,240
simple navigation I say simple

510
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,790
navigation as if it's a given right it's

511
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,120
definitely something that is relatively

512
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,520
easy to do on a simple level the more

513
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,439
complex kind of fuckery that you want to

514
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,070
you know get into with GPS for example

515
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,170
or any of the GNSS systems obviously you

516
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,600
know your hardware and your power

517
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,610
requirements go way up but we'll look at

518
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,429
a couple of those types of situations

519
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,560
right but when you look at what happens

520
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,960
when time changes well obviously

521
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,730
anything that is using time based

522
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,680
transactions from your financial

523
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,430
transaction stock trading and so forth

524
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,770
to airport luggage passenger and flight

525
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:34,040
tracking and many other things right

526
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,280
we've got issues with ICS SCADA and

527
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,070
general in the infrastructure Internet

528
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,899
of Things uses you know time based

529
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:47,600
signals for a lot of their stuff

530
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,490
including seating of session credentials

531
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,290
and and other things as well already

532
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,500
mentioned financial systems rely on that

533
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:58,129
precise timing and most of these systems

534
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,260
you know just to realize are reliant on

535
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,200
this even though there's no

536
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,700
authentication of signal right which was

537
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,870
one of those things that really blew my

538
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,300
mind when we started looking at this

539
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,120
like well hold on a second all of these

540
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,379
disparate industries if you will are

541
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,989
relying on a signal that has just

542
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,240
inherent open trust built into it as a

543
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:24,470
standard for example the systems that

544
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,260
are connected to ntp or via WWV be so

545
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,630
radio transmission of these GPS time

546
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,690
signals for example so pretty much all

547
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,540
of your radio clocks across the United

548
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,000
States are all essentially deriving

549
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,550
their time out of a rake radio frequency

550
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,750
server that is based in Colorado and

551
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,000
sending that data out so here we have a

552
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,040
nice little quote from NIST a

553
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,800
hypothetical disruption to GPS could

554
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,310
result in a thirty to forty five billion

555
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,370
dollars in economic losses over a 30-day

556
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:02,060
period so a tremendous amount of

557
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,889
business requires a GPS you know I know

558
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,820
from my side on the water for example

559
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:10,880
that all of our shipping is almost

560
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,070
entirely reliant on GPS or other global

561
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,990
satellite navigation systems right the

562
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,570
but primarily GPS

563
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,090
so when Chinese ships are coming into US

564
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,399
waters there are auto pilots for these

565
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,270
cargo ships that are cruising along at

566
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,809
25 to 40 knots they are basing their

567
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:33,050
signal off of these satellites so if for

568
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,178
example that signal is skewed bad things

569
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,309
are gonna happen some people haven't

570
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,740
have hypothesized now this is a

571
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:43,340
conspiracy theory or hypothesis sizing

572
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,860
exercise here but we had two very

573
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,678
specific events that happened in the

574
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,990
Pacific in the realm of the South China

575
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:54,290
Sea and between the South China Sea and

576
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,870
the Sea of Japan where large US Navy

577
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,970
boats went off course one of them ran

578
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,790
aground the other well ran into another

579
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,580
ship show and immediately following that

580
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:07,159
the u.s. Navy reactivated their

581
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,960
celestial navigation courses as a

582
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,970
requirement for anybody that's going to

583
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,850
be driving one of those things now it's

584
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,800
kind of telling to me when the United

585
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,290
States Navy decides that they want to go

586
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,690
back to a sextant town and a bunch of

587
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,300
tables to determine where the location

588
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,520
was on the planet so one of the first

589
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,580
kind of places where we started to see

590
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,429
widespread global navigation satellite

591
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,189
system spoofing and fuckery was out of

592
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:36,650
the Russian Federation so there's been

593
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,260
an ongoing project that are between a

594
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:43,070
group of engineers that are studying

595
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:46,370
this problem and but this originally

596
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:49,100
came out of fishing boats on the Black

597
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,350
Sea for example they had a number of

598
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,659
their boats go off course they were

599
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,780
noticing that their GLONASS receivers

600
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,059
for example were bearing white widely

601
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,639
you know showing them on land and

602
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,309
deviating from course and they started

603
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,080
to bring this data up to to the news and

604
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,428
the news media would would publish it

605
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,540
and so forth but what they uncovered was

606
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:14,630
currently as far as we know the most

607
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,879
sophisticated levels of the satellite

608
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,650
navigation system spoofing out there so

609
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,620
the Russians have been heavily involved

610
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,780
for a number of different reasons one to

611
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,239
protect their VIPs right they're very

612
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,160
important Putin's right you've got a

613
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,820
situation where they've seen this in

614
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,039
Moscow

615
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,649
they've seen this around important

616
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,860
events like the Sochi Olympics for

617
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:38,899
example they've seen this around

618
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,289
sensitive facilities the military

619
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:45,229
facilities and the like and including

620
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:48,320
one facility where it was originally

621
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,440
built as essentially a palace for the

622
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,450
Russian leadership kind of a a a Camp

623
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,600
David retreat on the OSHA are on the see

624
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,490
this reporting by these fishing captains

625
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,769
is actually forced the public attention

626
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,529
on what was going on it had been going

627
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:06,110
on in Moscow kind of for about a year

628
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,970
and a half or two before it was noticed

629
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,029
by the fishing captains and it is

630
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,830
currently an extremely active area you

631
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:15,679
can see from the slide that during these

632
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,500
exercises hundreds of shifts both

633
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,690
civilian military you know fishing

634
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,210
vessels so some kind of working vessels

635
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,639
all affected with false locations

636
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,279
hopefully they were using their eyes and

637
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:31,490
ears and nose as their primary senses of

638
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:34,820
navigation a magnetic compass and so

639
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:37,730
forth but I can tell you from a civilian

640
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,980
standpoint there are very few vessels

641
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:43,460
out there that are constantly doing dead

642
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,169
reckoning and and doing course plotting

643
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,169
on paper even though it is still

644
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:50,809
required in many locations so you know

645
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:53,480
that this allowed you know the Russians

646
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:55,668
to one develop extensive capabilities in

647
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:00,620
this arena another active area that we

648
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:03,740
see is Syria Syria is a huge place for

649
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,789
global navigation fuckery because you

650
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,759
know they're trying to protect their

651
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:10,580
assets they're trying to get our systems

652
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,950
to go off course for example so you know

653
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,340
if you wanted to protect a specific

654
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,009
location you would essentially skew the

655
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,769
the global navigation position for that

656
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:24,379
location so that if bombs like RJ dams

657
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:26,320
for example which enable essentially

658
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:30,379
dumb munitions to act as smart munitions

659
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,360
they're using a constant tracking of a

660
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:35,090
global navigation satellite system to

661
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,510
hit its intended target so if you change

662
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:41,449
the position of target a to location B

663
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,690
for example that JDAM once it leaves the

664
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,029
aircraft's news glowing

665
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,849
to find its target at location B as

666
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:50,599
opposed to location a the and in

667
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:53,939
addition to that provide essentially a

668
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:56,099
bubble where they can essentially move

669
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,129
positions change positions report false

670
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:02,158
positions to a wide area both on the

671
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:06,178
grounds and to low level orbit depending

672
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,159
on the power requirements here a little

673
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,570
bit on the technical side for some of

674
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,549
the ways that they're rumored to be

675
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,678
doing this they're performing some RF

676
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,869
jamming based attacks from both mobile

677
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,440
and fixed locations effectively creating

678
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:21,959
excess RF noise on the channels for the

679
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,210
l2 and the l5 signal coming from those

680
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,700
those satellites effectively forcing the

681
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,099
receivers to fall back to that the

682
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,889
primary and use the primary of l1 which

683
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,389
is quite easy to provide a spoof signal

684
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:35,309
for you have all these signals that you

685
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:37,379
can use and now all of them go away

686
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,330
except for one and its unauthenticated

687
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:41,189
potentially unauthenticated and now

688
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,199
you're just reliant on this one which is

689
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,119
now which is now spoofed yeah absolutely

690
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,119
the actual technology that they're using

691
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,728
you know for example or alleged to be

692
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,259
using in Russia and on their operations

693
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:57,479
is very sophisticated but the the base

694
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:00,119
parameters is a relatively simple right

695
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:02,039
so it's a question of acquiring hardware

696
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,478
and operating in a space that is

697
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,999
currently illegal in the United States

698
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:09,149
to operate other next layer we've been

699
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:10,679
shanghaied so uh the same group that has

700
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,978
been studying the global navigation

701
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,409
satellite spoofing activity noticed that

702
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:19,619
there was spoofing at the port of

703
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:22,559
Shanghai now they were doing a number of

704
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:25,289
things they they were spoofing GPS

705
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,029
signals they were spoofing Baidu signals

706
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:30,419
which is their particular satellite

707
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,169
navigation system also there was alleged

708
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:34,470
AI asked

709
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,039
signal spoofing so AIS is the using of

710
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,840
the VHF band to transmit location data

711
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,570
and additional data about the vessels

712
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,939
that are around you so for example I'll

713
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,369
take my sailboat out and fire up the the

714
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,820
chart plotter that is connected to a is

715
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:54,389
transmitter and receiver and that way my

716
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,399
course location and speed is transmitted

717
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:59,189
over VHF to those two

718
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,960
vessels in the local area the vessels in

719
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,690
the local area will see that on their

720
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,760
chart water and notify them if there's

721
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,590
going to be an imminent collision for

722
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,210
example and a bunch of other kind of

723
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,870
parameters that are surrounding that

724
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:15,060
from a is a s gets its data from GPS

725
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,729
that's that that's how it knows kind of

726
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,740
where it is on the planet owns it uses

727
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,010
calculation based on that data to figure

728
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,660
out course signal and speed so that when

729
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,750
transmits the heading information and

730
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,270
the speed information to the surrounding

731
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,900
vessels over VHF so we're looking at you

732
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,190
know what is it dive like 10 miles or

733
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,380
you know a rough line of sight to the

734
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,210
horizon it's 16 kilometers so that that

735
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,450
should be about 10 miles a you know in

736
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,640
in freedom units with regard to what we

737
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,440
see here is we see we see them

738
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,810
especially around the port of Shanghai

739
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,150
doing this now there are many reasons

740
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:54,030
why that could be happening right it's

741
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,950
certainly a unknown motivation right but

742
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,050
let's just say that you were trying to

743
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,610
track a specific shipping container

744
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,200
within the port of Shanghai well this

745
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,550
would make it very difficult to do there

746
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,950
are many governments around the world

747
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,629
that that ship things and put them

748
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,220
essentially on hold in different ports

749
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,280
for when they need them this could be a

750
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,560
way to essentially elude the precise

751
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,750
location of those within within that

752
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,330
area and the port for example it might

753
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:22,050
be as eluded here of potential to a sort

754
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:24,659
smuggling or illegal mining on the river

755
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:27,060
it could be something to deter piracy

756
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,730
right so that pirates couldn't rely on

757
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,710
the GPS signal but the problem is with

758
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,890
some of those theories for example is

759
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,540
that well if the Pirates can't rely on

760
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,300
the GPS signal neither can the shipping

761
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,760
captain's I've only seen video footage

762
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,919
of your chart plotters as you come into

763
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,110
let's say the port of Shanghai or the

764
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,200
port of Singapore for example and even

765
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,879
with all of that assisted navigation it

766
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,430
would be an absolute nightmare it's an

767
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,030
that to navigate I couldn't even imagine

768
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:59,430
without it and or if that data was wrong

769
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,300
or incorrect just as a side note that's

770
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,580
one of the things that we're really

771
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,070
concerned about here in the Pacific

772
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,590
Northwest with our shipping is having an

773
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,090
electronic warfare range that is jamming

774
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,908
signals moving signals and other things

775
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,379
so close to one of our most important

776
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:15,970
shipping channels and it's shared

777
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,620
between the US and Canada

778
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,020
same thing for the port of Shanghai it

779
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,908
definitely points to something unusual

780
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,440
going on we don't know what it is we've

781
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:28,360
also been able to confirm the GPS

782
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,510
confirm the GPS spoofing through things

783
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,969
like Strava for example you can see

784
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,730
essentially areas of kind of bloom of

785
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,140
data outside of the general clusters you

786
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,320
know which shows you that there's been

787
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,179
deviation in that direct area Odile we

788
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,600
can make a little animated gif going

789
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:48,100
going on there all right all right so

790
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,020
yeah it you know you know thinking back

791
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,000
to how easy it is for some civilians to

792
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,580
do this a couple commands here using GPS

793
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,799
SD our sim with a hack RF you need to

794
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,399
effectively calculate your time and/or

795
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,770
position based on a friend me I can't

796
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,760
pronounce it so we're gonna ephemerides

797
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,158
there we go

798
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,200
effectively did the knowledge of where

799
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,330
the satellites are to generate the

800
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,750
signal coming from l1 to be able to

801
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:16,510
either manipulate time and/or location

802
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,549
it generates a transmission which then

803
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,190
you play back with hacker of transfer

804
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:23,799
it's quite simple for us as millions to

805
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,529
be able to do some GPS spoofing over

806
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,389
short distances so we can do the same

807
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,460
things that nation-states can do over

808
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,960
much smaller distances and it's now

809
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,940
something within the realm of things

810
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,159
that that we can do Mike and I were

811
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:39,549
talking about some of this type of stuff

812
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,380
and the question came up of well clearly

813
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:43,299
they have these folks with loss of

814
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,340
motivation that the cads project the

815
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,950
University of Texas and various other

816
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,230
nation-state capability or detecting

817
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,049
when GPS is being messed with the

818
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:57,039
problem is is there's no method for

819
00:32:53,049 --> 00:33:00,279
civilians to be able to detect GPS

820
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:04,090
occurring so how do we do that there's

821
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:06,880
been a couple of projects out there to

822
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,250
deal with the GPS health one of them is

823
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,230
gal Mon which monitors the signals from

824
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,390
the satellites themselves to interpret

825
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:16,870
how they're reporting their health so

826
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:19,419
it's not the same sort of data and in

827
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,100
speaking with the gal Mountain folks

828
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:23,320
that there has been some of this data

829
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,719
available but it's been largely in a

830
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,600
khadeem

831
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,140
and of those projects for University of

832
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,709
Texas and cads which I'm just not privy

833
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,210
to

834
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,710
and just as a little side note

835
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,560
definitely go check out the Galman

836
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,270
project it was started literally two

837
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,490
weeks before we announced our project

838
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,350
which is awesome or at least they they

839
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,150
went public with their data it was put

840
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,280
together by a friend of mine Bert Hubert

841
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,440
in Holland it's brilliant guy used to

842
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,510
work with the Fox IT over there in the

843
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,720
Netherlands as Larry said it's really

844
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:58,330
focused on the health of the GNSS

845
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,180
satellites and their signal so if they

846
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:04,870
start to identify drifts for example or

847
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,150
a natural change in in gain for example

848
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,560
from those satellites they can confer

849
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,960
with the folks that are managing these

850
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,449
satellites to see you know if one the

851
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,639
signal is degrading if that satellite

852
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:18,339
has to be retired and or replaced what

853
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,010
we're more interested in is well is

854
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,169
there GPS fuckery going on or even time

855
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,360
signal fuckery going on and how can we

856
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:27,730
detect it how can you uri detect it

857
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,129
opposed to you know waiting for you know

858
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,020
some massively large funded projects you

859
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:35,230
know from you know a government agency

860
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,449
for example to detect it and or tell us

861
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,250
about it exactly well we started getting

862
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,549
into this we're like okay well let's

863
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,120
build one how hard could this be Larry

864
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,830
well it actually wasn't too bad but we

865
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,230
had lots of help so as part of this

866
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,480
keynote Mike I'm just gonna say you know

867
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,909
we we're calling this project whale in

868
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,000
and this is after a character in a

869
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:01,090
wonderful James Bond movie and we're

870
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,220
we're GPS fuckery was was definitely

871
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,140
introduced to the public when I called

872
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,689
Larry up and I said hey we should do

873
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,819
this so it would be a 1 an interesting

874
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,460
research project we have a couple

875
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,860
locations around where we could

876
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,740
potentially pick up some of this kind of

877
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,300
manipulation of that a signal and one

878
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,540
other thing about the signal

879
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,100
manipulation that we didn't mention is I

880
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,950
mentioned about the track companies

881
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,960
trying to monitor their trucks over GPS

882
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,230
and everything else well in the United

883
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,010
States that literally is the most common

884
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,260
use or manipulating GPS signal is done

885
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,480
by the truckers so if you live next to a

886
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,540
highway definitely put together a whale

887
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
in sensor and start start detecting when

888
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,490
those trucks are going by and spoofing

889
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,320
your

890
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,180
location signals definitely interesting

891
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,460
so Larry once you take it away

892
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,379
absolutely Mike and I talked about this

893
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,240
and research to what it would take to do

894
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,100
some detection and we put this together

895
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,569
with some help Mike and I were

896
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,580
definitely some idea guys and put some

897
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,440
skin in in the game technically but we

898
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,990
couldn't have done the Whelan project

899
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,660
without the help of our full-time

900
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:10,479
security analyst and developer faith

901
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,600
hadn't Guardians a huge thanks to faith

902
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,400
who was up until about 4:00 a.m. this

903
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,130
morning putting together the final

904
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,480
release for Whelan and knocking down

905
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,540
some of the last little little bits

906
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,790
she's on Pacific time so she will be up

907
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,590
soon and will be finishing the final

908
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,230
upload as part of the Wild West hack and

909
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,630
fest release for Whelan including a full

910
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,790
Raspberry Pi image for you to just burn

911
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,460
to Mike or SD and have a full running

912
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:39,520
system and not having to do any of the

913
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,470
manual install methods what we wanted to

914
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,380
do with Whalen is to provide an

915
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:47,049
inexpensive expandable open source

916
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,780
platform for citizens to be able to

917
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,590
approach and monitor for GPS fuckery

918
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,680
using and comparing the ability for us

919
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,720
to receive from multiple GNSS platforms

920
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,109
whether specifically here in the US we

921
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,569
can get Galileo GLONASS and GPS so our

922
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:06,460
initial development platforms feature

923
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,619
three different GPS receivers only

924
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,810
receiving signals from those satellites

925
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:13,000
in which we can compare and contrast the

926
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:16,060
location on those in case only one of

927
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,400
them is being confined the project on

928
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,320
github in the Whelan repository there's

929
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,940
also an Amazon wish lists with all the

930
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,980
parts including the extra stuff that

931
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,500
we'll be implementing in the future

932
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,440
currently using a Raspberry Pi 4 with

933
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,530
two rtos DRS for the future ad SB and

934
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,690
AIS reception so that we can compare and

935
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,240
contrast those to what is being received

936
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,880
from GPS we can also include more of

937
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,220
those for doing other time sources for

938
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,440
comparing time such as wwvv

939
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,270
and we're currently using three

940
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,970
satellite navigation receivers that you

941
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:51,700
block CMS with serial to TTL converters

942
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,850
and our current setup here for the u.s.

943
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,319
is GPS GLONASS and Galileo but if you're

944
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,359
in someplace else on the planet you can

945
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,960
configure those GPS receivers to use

946
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,360
other

947
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,120
systems and will give us the ability to

948
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,850
have multiple inputs from that data

949
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,299
currently we're taking all of that data

950
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:12,819
as gathered by the GPS units and

951
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,130
ingesting them once a daily into a local

952
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,620
influx may be instance which we then

953
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,780
post process once daily with graph on ax

954
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,819
which generates some nice visualizations

955
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,490
that we see here on the slide and then

956
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,590
if there's anything sort of outside of

957
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,200
two standard deviations for what we'd

958
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:32,020
expect or distance at a fixed locations

959
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,330
it currently sends some alerts to your

960
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,250
own configurable discord server and

961
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,620
channel but it's extensible so we can

962
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,650
create additional methods later whether

963
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,839
it be IVA email SMS text all sorts of

964
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,820
these other things and and on the right

965
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,980
is a picture of actually the station

966
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,480
that is behind me stuck up against my

967
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,520
window this one happens to be when we

968
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,470
had it deployed in Seattle for some

969
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,509
initial testing it expensive to build

970
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,669
fairly small and all sorts of other fun

971
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,340
stuff but Mike tell us about where we

972
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,110
want to take it on the future absolutely

973
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,420
one of the things that was so cool about

974
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:07,090
just the simple platform that Larry came

975
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,370
up with there is that it is expandable

976
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,380
or even kind of make it smaller we're

977
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,839
just giving you an example of kind of

978
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:17,890
what we did right now our next stages

979
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:20,350
are gonna be to put together a site for

980
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,960
our whale in so that other people can

981
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,970
essentially create accounts and upload

982
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,120
their own data so we can have kind of a

983
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:30,370
global view of where these sensors are

984
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,710
and what they're what's it detecting if

985
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,170
they're detecting an event and have it

986
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,620
have some capability to be able to push

987
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,940
out alerts when we're noticing these

988
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,460
particular events I made a little joke

989
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,040
here for Johannes Ulrich D field here

990
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:48,730
but for GPS the D field was essentially

991
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,230
the original gatherer of intrusion

992
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,900
detection data that became the storm

993
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,640
center we also want to add some

994
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,750
additional support as Larry mentioned or

995
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:03,370
a DSP in a is just to see for example

996
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:06,700
when we detect a GPS deviation do we see

997
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:09,400
it on either a is so that'll be surface

998
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,770
of the water essentially or a DSB which

999
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,940
is coming directly from aircraft so if

1000
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,730
we see a B is

1001
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,009
isn't changing but a is that is changing

1002
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,170
but we can get a general idea of kind of

1003
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:22,299
the power of the transmission and the

1004
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,519
scale of the fuckery and some other

1005
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:26,890
things too for some additional receipt

1006
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:30,189
of time-based stuff we can use all of

1007
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:32,890
the various RF based time sources WWV

1008
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,839
here in the US and a bunch of others

1009
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,660
across the planet for over-the-horizon

1010
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,910
time synchronization such as those RF

1011
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,589
enabled time clocks and so forth we also

1012
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,420
want to do some a little bit better

1013
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:46,089
alerting methods either locally or

1014
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,950
through the quote global reporting

1015
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,529
engine so that we can support additional

1016
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,899
platforms Dischord happen to be quite

1017
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:55,329
easy for us to get set up as a sample to

1018
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,829
show how we're doing it or it can be

1019
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,079
done and then we're currently using

1020
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,579
batch processing for the alerting so

1021
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,380
we'd like to be able to make that so

1022
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:03,609
it's more real-time so that as soon as

1023
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,319
it happens you can potentially get a

1024
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:07,210
text message as opposed to getting a

1025
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:08,980
text message at midnight to say that it

1026
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,460
happened at some point over the last 24

1027
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,549
hours

1028
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:15,190
so Mike how can I help the biggest thing

1029
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:17,799
would be to go out and get yourself a

1030
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,619
copy of the code or the distro and set

1031
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:23,400
up a sensor and also help out you know

1032
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:25,480
with ideas or code to help build out the

1033
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,759
essentially the reporting engine that's

1034
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,049
the the big Next heavy-lift we've got

1035
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:31,059
something that you can monitor your own

1036
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:33,940
but we want to definitely improve the

1037
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:37,150
sharing and effectively crowdsourcing

1038
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,039
the detection of GPS fuckery what this

1039
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,630
is a keynote so we talked about some

1040
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,670
technical things and we really want to

1041
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,980
sort of get everybody together at the

1042
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,190
end of this and realize that this

1043
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,430
problem is so much larger than just GPS

1044
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,690
and to sort of provide a call to action

1045
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,058
we thought about this from the

1046
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,410
perspective of GPS what happens when

1047
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,940
someone messes with this on

1048
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,899
authenticated signal that can affect

1049
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,670
time and/or location the problem is is

1050
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,369
that in our daily lives and in our

1051
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:09,910
enterprises we're reliant on so many

1052
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:12,880
other sources of unauthenticated RF

1053
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,788
transmissions and what happens when

1054
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,970
people start screwing with those other

1055
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:24,220
signals that we blindly trust whether

1056
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:26,560
that be GSM or television or FM radio

1057
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,850
with data transmission with RDS

1058
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:34,330
on 433 4 and 33 megahertz I'm seeing in

1059
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:37,000
discord vor and ILS for flight control

1060
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:41,080
there are so many things that we've

1061
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,680
become reliant on as a society for magic

1062
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:46,600
RF that we have no ability to detect we

1063
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,109
become reliant on its unauthenticated so

1064
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:53,110
where's the next fuckery going to happen

1065
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,370
from an RF perspective think about what

1066
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,710
those other transmissions that were

1067
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,390
relying on for our organizations and

1068
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,430
they may be transmissions we don't even

1069
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:03,400
know about right now but they're still

1070
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,230
there and think about how manipulation

1071
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,470
of those would impact your organization

1072
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,840
and then think about how we can go build

1073
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:14,560
detection mechanism because this problem

1074
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,650
is larger than GPS we really need to

1075
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,009
step up our detection game for all of

1076
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,420
these signals as a society so that we

1077
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,160
can protect ourselves for things that

1078
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,710
we've become reliant on so that's sort

1079
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,470
of our challenge to you as the listener

1080
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:32,230
is to take this to the next step

1081
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,490
think about all these other systems and

1082
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,800
might could you sort of have any final

1083
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,779
words on this one as well yeah you know

1084
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,120
you might be thinking to yourselves okay

1085
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,340
I'm not on a sailboat or I'm not in an

1086
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,779
urban situation I'm I'm out in farm

1087
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,850
country somewhere well just remember

1088
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:49,900
what do you think those large combines

1089
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:51,910
set their borders - oh right GPS signal

1090
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,620
and GPS posts in the ground that ought

1091
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,660
to make you sleep well at night but

1092
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,400
definitely you know go out there and

1093
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,799
think of these things figure out a way

1094
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,070
that we can bring the detection of that

1095
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,080
manipulation to the civilian population

1096
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:07,420
absolutely and and and to that you know

1097
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,690
we've talked about in other venues about

1098
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,090
creating FM radio signals with some

1099
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,100
other projects and it's very difficult

1100
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,170
for organizations to detect that there

1101
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,670
are F environment has changed because

1102
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,550
there isn't a lot of detection

1103
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,900
mechanisms now and would become reliant

1104
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,630
on them that we now need to become

1105
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,390
reliant on detection systems or when

1106
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,190
they change so we've got one minute left

1107
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,529
apparently my slides have gone away

1108
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:38,170
thank you everybody for hanging out with

1109
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:40,000
us that's what I was gonna say if you

1110
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,550
guys have any questions please join the

1111
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,130
discord

1112
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,200
Mike and Larry will be in there and just

1113
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,120
address your questions directly to them

1114
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,990
in the discord channel that would be

1115
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,500
fantastic

1116
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,500
and I think
